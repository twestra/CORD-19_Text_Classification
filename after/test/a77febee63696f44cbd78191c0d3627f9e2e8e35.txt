At this moment, the world leaves under the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak pandemic.
As Otolaryngologists -Head & Neck Surgeons, we need to perform and participate in examinations and procedures within the head and neck region and airway that are at particularly high risk of exposure and infection because of aerosol and droplet contamination. One of those surgical procedures on demand at this moment is tracheostomy, due the increasing admission in ICU departments and the increased need of ventilatory support secondary to respiratory distress syndrome. This review of international guidelines for tracheostomy in COVID-19 infected patients, aiming to summarize in a systematic way the available recommendations from 18 guidelines from all over the world.
Since the first described cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- of patients suffer severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and between 3-15 % will need respiratory support in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). [6] [7] [8] As Otolaryngologists -Head & Neck Surgeons, we need to perform and participate in examinations and procedures within the head and neck region and airway that are at particularly high risk of exposure and infection because of aerosol and droplet contamination. 9 One of those surgical procedures on demand at this moment is tracheostomy, due the increasing admission in ICU departments and the increased need of ventilatory support secondary to respiratory distress syndrome. In this respect, it is of paramount importance to establish tracheostomy guidelines that focus equally on both patient's and health care team's well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to minimize risk of viral exposure. .

The systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. 10 This review involved a systematic search of the electronic databases Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes according to (PICO) framework. 11 Population:
Inclusion criteria consisted of clinical guidelines comprehensively reporting
Severe COVID-19 patients treatment strategies.
Intervention and comparison were defined according to the need for tracheostomy, COVID-19 status, indications for tracheostomy, measures of protection, type of tracheostomy technique, diathermy or not, surgical setting, post-tracheostomy care.
The primary outcome was to describe a set of recommendations to improve tracheostomy safety. 1 and 2 and figure 1.
The AGREE-II domain percentages for each guideline are shown in table 3.
None of those selected guidelines stated the methods used in the literature search, the quality of the evidence, and the strengths of the recommendations reported.
With this quality domain, the aim of the guideline under scrutiny is determined.
A total of 8 guidelines obtained a score of 100%, 14,15,21-26,29 7 a score >80%, [17] [18] [19] [20] 24, 27, 28 and 2 a score <70 13, 16 . Therefore, 15 of the reviewed guidelines had a clearly described scope and purpose.

Details about the research strategy, evidence rating scales and evidence selection criteria were not described in any guidelines. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The update was indicated in 2 guidelines. 15, 23 
All guidelines provided a clear presentation and summary of recommendations.
One of them offered an algorithm. 26
All guidelines offered elements regarding applicability in the context of operative room or ICU setting, and protective measures were provided to healthcare workers. Also, elements concerning implementation were described on each guideline.
Just one guideline provides recommendations in a resource-constrained setting. 27
The overall mean domain score and SD were 79 ± 6.3%. No guidelines provided information about interest or financing. However, almost all come from institutions or national societies and this information is not relevant for tracheostomy in the context of the pandemic.
Fifteen (88%) guidelines were assessed and recommended for use during COVID-19 pandemic, since their quality scores 6 or more, 14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] representing goodquality guidelines. The 2 remaining guidelines had scores between 5 and 6. 13, 16 These guidelines were recommended for COVID-19 attention, but not as tracheostomy guidelines.

The following statements reflects the current practice of surgical airway management in patient suffering a severe COVID-19 infection. Given the dynamic nature of scientific information and technology and the emergence of new data during and after the outbreak, the information herein presented should be managed carefully.
Periodic reviews, updates, and revisions are required and expected. Tracheostomy surgical steps and technical notes are beyond the scope of this paper.
The availability to test patients differs among countries, even among each region within every country. Ideally, being able to assess COVID-19 status prior to performing a tracheostomy, is of paramount importance. PCR or serology tests are scarce due to the outbreak and the limited resources in some settings needs to be taken into consideration.
Moreover, data regarding viral load in the upper airway (nasopharynx and oropharynx) is confusing. Early data suggest a higher viral load in the early phase of the disease, between days 9 to15. 31,32 However, new evidence suggests viral loads detection in secretions up to 2-3 weeks, after onset of symptoms. 33 .

[13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 27, 28 Furthermore, for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, there is a strong recommendation against performing a tracheostomy in patients who are infectious and have a high viral burden. One guidelines specifies that during the pandemic all patients should be considered positive (until proven otherwise) and full PPE needs to be used during each procedure. 18 Other guidelines do not specify or mention the need of a recent test prior to a tracheostomy. 23-26 All guidelines recommend, as expected, proceeding in case of emergency or crash tracheostomy regardless of COVID-19 status, using all full PPE. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 
During the outbreak, barrier precautions are critical in order to protect healthcare workers from contamination or infection. All the consulted guidelines recommends a full PPE due to the high risk of infection, including N95 or N99 (USA), FFP2 or FFP3 (Europe) mask, the use of double gloves, goggles or eye protection, Powered airpurifying respirator (PARP), face shield and an apron or gown. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Careful hand hygiene is recommended with hydroalcoholic solution. After every tracheostomy, careful PPE removal following the sequential protocol is important to avoid contamination. Also, a designated person to closely supervised this step is mandatory. 34
It is relevant to understand that COVID-19 patients with some comorbidities have a poor prognosis. 35 Identifying the most important risk groups is essential during the decision-making process. A recent meta-analysis identified hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease as significant risk factors for COVID-19 patients. 36 Also, the Italian experience .

Open and percutaneous tracheostomy represent an aerosol generating procedures (AGP), related to an increases in potential viral exposure for the healthcare team involved. 38 It is attributed to aerosolized viral particles, which can stay for up to 3 hours. 39 Furthermore, after tracheostomy, there is an increased potential for virus exposure to the ICU team who perform several bedside procedures from simple examination to suctioning, dressing changes and other routine post-tracheotomy care. 15 According to Wuhan epidemic data, affected health workers represented 3.8% of the infected patients and 14.8% of them suffered a severe disease, with an overall mortality rate of 0.6%. 6,40,41 Also, In Italy and Spain, 15-20% of responding healthcare workers were infected, and some have died. 42
Indications and timing represent the most controversial issue. Is important to highlight that the indication comes from the ICU clinicians or anesthesiologists in charge of the patients and there are lot of parameters that need to be taken into consideration. It´s necessary to establish a multidisciplinary team (ICU doctor, Anesthesiologist, ENT or Head & Neck Surgeon) to discuss every single case. Our findings present a high variability in national guidelines and protocols guidelines.
European guidelines propose a more aggressive approach (early tracheostomy) 23,24,25 , maybe attributed the high volume of cases at this moment of the outbreak. By contrast British, North American, Singaporean and South-African guidelines propose a more conservative approach, suggesting waiting for at least 14 days of ventilation or a .

COVID-19 negative test (PCR or Two negative pharyngeal swabs) before performing an elective tracheostomy. They also recommend avoiding tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients during periods of respiratory instability or heightened ventilator dependence. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [27] [28] [29] Looking at previous reports, benefits of performing an early tracheotomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients are unclear and based on the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak with a similar coronavirus, demonstrated that the need for mechanical ventilation was associated with a 46% mortality. 43 Also, during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak doctors were unable to identify the exact time-point when afflicted patients either improve, remain stable, or progress toward death due to pulmonary complications. As the mean time from onset to death was 23.7 days, there was a very low potential benefit of tracheotomy prior to this time. 44 Early evidence from Wuhan shows that the time from hospital admission to death was log normally distributed with mean 11 days and median 5 days. However, this data not reach statically significance (p = 0.56). 45 Givi et al. suggests delaying most tracheostomy procedures beyond 14 days, first of all given the high infectious risks during the procedure, arguing that early phases of COVID-19 infection may be related to a higher viral load. Secondly, given that after 14 days the likelihood of recovery is higher, and the ventilator weaning has become the primary goal of care. 9 A recent systematic review suggested that early tracheostomy, performed in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation, is associated with a reduction of mechanical ventilation duration, mortality rate and length of stay in ICU irrespective of reason for admission. 46 By contrast, a previous randomized clinical trial, did not show an improved mortality rate or reduced length of ICU stay in patients on mechanical ventilation that underwent early tracheostomy. 47 Furthermore, a meta-analysis of .

However, trial sequential analysis (TSA), a kind of cumulative meta-analysis, indicated that the evidence was unreliable and inconclusive. 48 However, more data from COVID-19 patients is needed to compare both early versus late and suggest proper timing to perform a tracheostomy. Meanwhile seems prudent to evaluate individually prognosis factors before doing a procedure that could expose healthcare workers.
After reviewing the guidelines, we found recommendations against and in favor of both techniques. Six guidelines did not specify the type of technique recommended, 13, 15, 19, 20, 28, 29 3 guidelines recommend open tracheostomy, 14 Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) hypothetically involves a more extensive airway manipulation, due to the need for bronchoscopy and/or serial dilations during trachea entry and put the patient's airway in contact with the surgeons from the beginning. These factors can increase aerosolization risks compared with OT, in which there is no contact with the patient's airway during dissection of the neck and tracheal opening is performed quickly with an incision. Also, aerosolization risks can be mitigated with some specific measures like advancing the tube with the cuff inflated .

All the reviewed guidelines emphasize the importance of a proper surgical setting. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Evidence from the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, highlight the role of bedside tracheostomy in the ICU in negative-pressure rooms. 49,50,53,54 These measures are directed to avoid unnecessary transport of patients and repeated handling (connection and disconnection) of ventilatory circuits during transfer, which may increase the risk of contamination. Nevertheless, some guideline recommends establishing a COVID-19
Operating room (OR) to perform this procedure. In this case, it should be ideal to do it in a negative pressure OR, with well-demarcated areas and routes for patient transport. 26,29,55
Almost all the guidelines recommend minimal staff during the procedure, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] composed of two surgeons, one anesthetist or ICU doctor, one scrub nurse and a second .

Airway team) composed of a senior consultant (ENT or Head & Neck Surgeon) to lead the surgery, assisted by a Skilled assistant (Junior Faculty or consultant), who needs to be familiar with all the surgical steps of tracheostomy in order to minimize the time spent in the contaminated room. 29
Surgical smoke is created when the electrocautery instrument is used to cut, coagulate, or ablate tissue. The tissue is heated to the boiling point of its constituent fluids, causing membranes to rupture, ejecting a bioaerosol. 56 The use of an efficient, filtered evacuation system is indicated, particularly where there is the possibility of dissemination of viral particles. 57 Only 6 guidelines mention anything about the use of cold or diathermy dissection. Five guidelines recommend avoiding the use of diathermy. 15, 21, 23, 25, 26 One guideline recommends minimizing the use of diathermy. 24
The first step recommended is the suction of oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and tracheal secretions with a Yankauer suction tip and an in-line suction system. 21
Prior to making tracheal window, neuromuscular blockade should be confirmed with the anesthetist in order to avoid swallowing and cough reflexes. Oxygenation must be achieved. Once the anterior wall of the trachea is exposed, the anesthetist or ICU doctor needs: 1) to reduce the oxygen-percentage of the inflated air to 21%, 2)to advance blindly the tube as caudally as possible with cuff inflated, looking for signs of right main bronchial intubation and 3) to hyper-inflate the tube cuff to ensure lower airway isolation and reduce the risk of aerosoling. 58 Prior to making the tracheal window an additional dose of muscle relaxant can be useful; ventilation needs to be stopped to avoid aerosolization in case of cuff puncture. 21 .

Post-tracheostomy care should be performed by trained nursing staff. Safe suction with a closed airway circuit and regular checks of cuff-pressure is 
All guidelines suggest using Humidity-Moisture filters (HME) after tracheostomy. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Commercial filters are described and recommended for laryngectomy patients and for patients after elective tracheostomy given many carriers are asymptomatic. Both products have an effective electrostatic filter that can protect against >99% of viruses and bacteria according to the composition.
The present study has some limitations. The absence of prospective data about indications, timing and relevance of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients is limiting the level of evidence used to provide robust guidelines. We have probably not included all the existing guidelines since many of them are not available online.
