Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused 53 by the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in Hebei Province of China and 54 has spread to other parts of the world [1, 2] . The number of cases has been increasing rapidly, 55 with a case-fatality rate of 2.3% [3] . 56
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens is the first crucial step for the 57 guidance of treatment, effective infection control in the hospital and control of infection in 58 the community. Screening of infection in suspected cases with a nucleic acid amplification 59 test (NAAT), such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in respiratory 60 specimens, is recommended by the World Health Organization [4] . However, the collection 61 of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimens is a relatively invasive method and 62 the procedure might put healthcare workers at higher risk for disease transmission during 63 patients' gag reflex, cough, or sneezing. 64
As SARS-CoV-2 viral load was demonstrated to present near presentation onset [5] , 65 using a saliva sample as the specimen for the screening of the disease is appealing. To 66 determine the potential of using a saliva sample for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we 67 conducted a prospective study investigating the correlation of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a 68 saliva sample, and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs in patients under investigation at an 69 acute respiratory infection clinic at a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during the 70 
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimens was performed by real-time RT-PCR 97 amplification of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1AB and N gene fragments, using a SARS-CoV-2 98

The prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat 124 swab RT-PCR, and saliva RT-PCR in this study were 9.5% and 9.0%, respectively. 125 .

was also detected in saliva samples [11] . This suggested that the salivary glands could be a 154 potential target for SAR-CoV-2 infection, and hence saliva could be a potential sample for 155 SARS-CoV-2 detection. 156
From recent findings, SARS-CoV-2 was detected from posterior oropharyngeal saliva 157 samples, with a notable high viral load at the disease presentation. [5, 12] . In their protocol, 158 an early morning saliva was collected after coughing up by clearing the throat. In our study, a 159 saliva sample was the patient's self-generated, without a need for coughing up. This non-160 invasive procedure might be less aerosol-generating and might reduce the risk of infection for 161 health care workers working in the clinic. 162
Although testing of saliva might provide an advantage as an easy procedure, a 163 comparison study between saliva and confirmed case of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 164 or convalescence serum titre has not been available. A recent study that detected the virus 165 from multiple sites showed a lower test positivity rate from the nasal swab (63%), as 166 compared to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93%) [13] . Therefore, a false negative test of 167 the SARS-CoV-2 from saliva sample might possible, and this would be an area for further 168 exploration. However, the spectrum of the disease ranges from asymptomatic, upper 169 respiratory tract symptoms, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [14, 15] . 170
Hence, the discrepancy of SARS-CoV-2 detection from different specimens might also be 171 possible. 172
The study had several strengths. We prospectively collected data on consecutive 173 patients who were at high risk of COVID-19 infection including those with acute respiratory 174 symptoms and having risk factors, thus minimizing potential spectrum effect.
