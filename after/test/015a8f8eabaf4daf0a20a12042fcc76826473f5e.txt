Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating historical event which is currently impacting nearly all of mankind. SARS CoV-2 incidence is surging in numerous cities and countries across the globe (1), and infection carries a high mortality rate, particularly among the elderly (2) (3) (4) . While social distancing has slowed and even eliminated many local epidemics, it is not an economically viable long-term strategy (5) . There is no evidence of widespread herd immunity and a vaccine is unlikely to be developed and implemented within the next 18 months. Therefore, second and third waves of infection are likely to occur over the next two years (6) .
It is imperative that optimal treatment strategies of COVID-19 are identified during the first wave of infection to ensure that the case fatality rate is lower during subsequent local epidemics. To date, selection of antiviral agents has been empirical and guided by limited or absent data. The window to conduct definitive clinical trials is likely to be narrow given that flatten the curve efforts are predicted to slow local epidemics, albeit temporarily. Therefore, effective tools are urgently needed to optimize the design of these trials.
Here we use mathematical models to project the possible impact of two small molecular agents, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine; as well as broadly neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunotherapies. The goal of our models is to interpret emerging clinical trial data, and in turn to perfect subsequent trials in terms of selection of antiviral agents, timing of therapy, dosage, treatment duration, avoidance of drug resistance and selection of virologic endpoints. Overall, our simulations support initiation of therapy soon after symptoms develop and also suggest the urgent need for studies to identify virologic surrogates of SARS CoV-2 severity.
We used four datasets of SARS CoV-2 shedding in the absence of effective treatment to develop and validate a mathematical model. This data included 25 infected people: 11 from Singapore (7), 9 from Germany (8), one from Korea (9) , and 4 from France (10) (Fig 1) . Notably, sampling techniques differed across studies. In Singapore, Korea and France, samples were obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs, whereas in Germany viral loads were measured directly from sputum. Shedding was notable for an early peak, followed by three phases of viral decay including a rapid initial decline from peak, a slower period of decay of variable length, followed by a third abrupt elimination of the low levels of remaining virus. Of note, we only captured the viral peak as well as the final rapid clearance phase in a subset of study participants. There was one example of substantial, transient viral re-expansion (G7 in Fig 1) .
We developed a series of ordinary differential equations to fit to the viral load data (Fig.  1a , Methods and Materials). The equations capture the coupled interactions of susceptible cells, infected cells, SARS CoV-2 and a mounting immune response. In keeping with the standard viral dynamics model (11, 12) , virus enters susceptible cells and converts them to infected dells which then produce virus at a fixed rate. Based on model fitting, we included two immune responses. The first accounts for the rate of infected cell elimination by the innate immune system and is governed by an exponent; in keeping with prior research, we refer to this as the density-dependent immune response (13, 14) . The second phase is a slower cytolytic response in which per cell killing rate saturates once the total number of effector cells exceeds a certain level. We model this with stages of presumed effector cell precursors which differentiate at rate q as a method to calibrate timing.
Our model reproduced viral load kinetics in all 25 participants (Fig. 1b) . In certain cases, the model only fit to available data from the later stages of shedding, whereas it recapitulated the entirety of viral expansion, peak and decelerating clearance for several study participants (S5, S14, S18, G1, G2, G5, G7). In keeping with observations from a recent clinical trial (15) , low level shedding continued past 20 days for some German participants (G1, G2, G3, G5, G6), whereas viral elimination occurred in the remaining infected people.
We continuously quantified the value of the immune terms in all 25 participants: the per cell killing rate and total number of cells killed per day was extremely high during the first several days of infection in all participants (Fig. 2a, b) , coinciding with peak viral load. The cytolytic immune response initiated at various timepoints across participants (day 5-17) and led to lower per cell and total killing rates relative to the innate response but was sufficient to eliminate remaining infection (Fig. 2b) .
We developed a pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model of remdesivir (Fig. 3a) , a broad-spectrum nucleotide analogue that targets SARS CoV-2 replication in infected cells (16) . The model links intravenous administration with plasma levels of free drug and concentrations of the drug's active nucleotide-triphosphate component (NTP) observed within PBMCs in nonhuman primates (17) , and captures the slow decay of NTP within this compartment (Fig. 3b) .
With multiple doses, we project stable levels of NTP in target cells over time (Fig. 3c) followed by slow decay after cessation of treatment.
We next simulated possible dose response curves of antiviral efficacy, which capture the percentage of viral replication eliminated, according to micromolar concentration of drug. The percent of viral replication suppression at a given intracellular drug concentration is dependent on the intracellular EC50 of the drug, or the concentration of drug required to lower viral replication by 50% (Fig 3d) . Of note the intracellular EC50 is unknown for remdesivir, particularly in vivo, making predictions of clinical trial outcomes impossible.
Finally, we combined the PK and PD models as in Fig. 3a to project the percentage of viral replication inhibited over time at different assumed intracellular EC50 values (18, 19) . With high assumed drug potency (EC50=0.8 uM), antiviral effect are sustained over the 10-day dosing interval and are maintained for a long period once drug delivery has stopped (Fig. 3e) . At higher assumed EC50 values, remdesivir potency is projected to be lower.
We next simulated therapy at day 10 of infection (Fig. 4a) , when severely infected people often seek hospital care, and at day 5 of infection immediately after viral peak (Fig. 4b) , when infected people often become symptomatic. In both cases, when remdesivir in vivo potency was assumed to be high (EC50=0.8 uM), viral elimination occurred rapidly after initiation of therapy. This effect occurred because of unopposed removal of approximately 100-1000 infected cells per day by an ongoing innate immune response (Fig. 2b) .
Simulations with the assumption of a less potent version of remdesivir (EC50= 8 or 80 uM) resulted in a lower viral clearance slope. This result implies that viral clearance slope in clinical trials can be used in concert with our model to directly estimate the in vivo intracellular EC50 value of remdesivir in each treated patient. The model can then be used to project the effect of increasing or decreasing doses in subsequent trials.
We next performed simulations of therapy at very early timepoints during infection at and prior to peak viral load. Most infected people are pre-symptomatic at this stage so these model realizations may most closely reflect implementation of a post exposure prophylaxis strategy in which some people are already in the very early stages of infection at the time of first dose. Under this scenario, extremely potent (EC50=0.8 uM) therapies at day 2 and 0 of infection resulted in immediate viral suppression (Fig. 4c, d) . With early, low or moderate potency treatment, the model predicted therapeutic failure with persistent SARS CoV-2 shedding due to insufficient early immunity against the virus (Fig. 4d) .
We next repeated the above exercise with a shorter 5-day course of treatment. Results were similar though simulations under the assumption of extremely early initiation of therapy did not lead to full SARS CoV-2 suppression within this timeframe (Fig. S1 ).
We next assessed which unknown variables in our therapeutic model were most predictive of relevant therapeutic outcomes. As independent variables, we selected in vivo intracellular EC50, because the potency of remdesivir against SARS CoV-2 in humans is unknown, and infection duration at the time of treatment initiation. As dependent variables, we selected shedding duration and viral area under the curve because it is unclear which of these outcomes is a stronger predictor of progression to cytokine storm and respiratory failure, as well as transmissibility, in infected people. We also included the final tally of effector cells as this outcome may also be predictive of likelihood of cytokine storm (20) .
Early initiation of a highly potent therapy was predictive of lower shedding duration whether given in the pre-peak asymptomatic phase or in the post-peak symptomatic phase beyond day 2-4 of infection. However, extremely early initiation of a lower potency therapy was predicted to prolong shedding relative to no treatment (Fig. 5a) .
Both high drug potency and extremely early treatment initiation during the presymptomatic stage of infection were required to significantly lower viral area under the curve. Even highly potent therapy during the earliest symptomatic phase at days 4-5 had only a slight impact on viral area under the curve, reflecting the fact that most virus and infected cells are generated during the first 2-3 days of SARS CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5b) .
Finally, initiation of a highly potent therapy within 6 days of infection lowered the extent of the effector cell response in our simulations (Fig. 5c ) which may suggest that an early test and treat strategy could lower deleterious infection associated inflammation.
Based on the mutation rate of positive ss RNA viruses of approximately 10 -5 mutations per base pair per cell infection (21) , and on the fact that two separate mutations may induce partial remdesivir resistance in SARS CoV-1 which in turn leads to a less fit virus (22) , we estimated the probability that a drug resistant mutant would emerge during therapy. When we assumed a potent therapy (EC50=0.8), the model projects that while single and double mutants will emerge, they are unlikely to predominate or meaningfully extend duration of shedding if dosed during the symptomatic phase of disease, though resistance may emerge with early dosing (Fig. 6a,b) . However, if a moderate potency is assumed, then a single mutant with resistant is predicted to persist, particularly if therapy is initiated before or during viral peak (Fig. 7a,b) .
If we assume that a single point mutation in SARS CoV-2 could theoretically induce complete resistance, then treatment failure may occur regardless of dose timing. The resistant strain is predicted to predominate raising the possibility of transmitted drug resistance (Fig. S2) .

Using a multi-compartment PK/PD model for hydroxychloroquine (Fig. S3a) , we first recapitulated drug levels of the drug over time following a single dose (Fig. S3b) , simulated twice daily doses over 10 days (Fig. S3c) , generated theoretical dose response curves (Fig. S3d) , and then projected drug efficacy over time (Fig. S3e) . As with remdesivir, the predicted efficacy of therapy on shedding depended on timing of treatment and the intracellular in vivo EC50 (Fig.  S4a-e) . Lowering the area under the curve again required extremely early initiation of potent treatment (Fig. S4f) while decreasing the number of effector cells required effective dosing within the first 5 days of infection (Fig. S4g) .
Broadly neutralizing antibody predictions. We next simulated a single infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies with prolonged half-life. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are designed to stop infection of new cells rather than eliminate viral replication. We used a dual compartment PK model for (Fig. S5a) , estimated antibody levels over time following a single dose (Fig. S5b) , generated theoretical dose response curves (Fig. S5c) , and then projected antibody efficacy over time (Fig. S5d) . The predicted efficacy of therapy on shedding again was dependent on timing of treatment and the in vivo EC50 (Fig. S6a-d) . Once again, to lower duration of shedding and the number of effector cells depended on therapeutic potency, while effective lowering of viral area under the curve required extremely early initiation of potent treatment ( Fig. S6e-g) .
We generalized the potential effects of a cellular immunotherapy which would presumably decrease the lifespan of infected cells. We projected that such an intervention would need to increase this rate 10-fold to match the efficacy of a potent small molecular agent. (Fig. S7a-c) . Immunotherapies were projected to have no efficacy if started prior to peak shedding (Fig. S7d ).
SARS CoV-2 infection is characterized by a stereotypical viral kinetic pattern with a high peak viral load during the first several days of infection, a subsequent short rapid decay period followed by a slower clearance phase of variable duration, and a final, rapid elimination phase. Our mathematical model reproduces this data and explains that the transition from first to second phase viral decay is governed by a density dependent term in which a massive die off of infected cells occurs during peak viremia. Viral clearance rate slows considerably once the viral load decreases below a threshold of ~10 5 RNA copies. A late slowly expanding cytolytic T cell response is predicted to induce eradication of infected cells in the upper airway 2-20 days later. The timing of this final response appears to be variable among infected people. Moreover, it is unknown if cessation of viral replication in the nasopharynx guarantees the same result in the lung or other anatomic compartments (8) .
We built therapy simulations on top of these natural kinetics to glean knowledge about the possible impact of antiviral therapies. While accurate prediction is impossible in the absence of clinical trial data, we are able to make several observations which highlight the importance of off treatment viral dynamics in understanding treatment effects. Our results can guide future study design and assist in interpretation of forthcoming trial data in multiple ways.
First, it is critical to know whether in vitro potency assessments of remdesivir, hydroxycholorquine and bNAbs can be projected onto human infection. We previously demonstrated that in vivo IC50 values for antiviral agents can exceed estimates derived from cell cultures experiments by a multiple of 5-10 for small molecule antiviral drugs (19) . A similar observation has been hypothesized for HIV targeting monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (23) . It is unclear if this discrepancy occurs due to low blood levels in tissue, different cell metabolism of drug in tissue or higher protein binding in vivo. Whatever the case, if in vitro potency measurements of hydroxycholoroquine and remdesivir overestimate in vivo activity, or if higher intracellular levels are required than in plasma, then these drugs may be less effective in clinical trials. Higher dosing may be a possible solution to circumvent this issue.
Second, effective dosing after symptom development predicts rapid subsequent elimination of infected. Most current clinical trials are focused primarily on hospitalized patients whereas our results and those from other COVID models suggest that treatment in the days immediately following symptom onset will decrease the duration of detectable viral shedding (24, 25) . Our model also predicts that early treatment will limit the extent of the cytolytic immune response required to clear infection. If either of these outcomes are correlates of progression to severe disease and transmission risk, then as with HIV (26), influenza (27) , and Ebola (28), early test and treat is a vital, currently overlooked strategy.
Third, effective dosing soon after onset of symptoms is predicted to have an insignificant effect on viral load AUC. This phenomenon occurs because the amount of virus produced per hour at the early peak is far higher than the amount produced per day during the lower viral load second decay phase. This finding provides a cautionary message: if subsequent disease severity and development is imprinted during the high viral load, pre-symptomatic phase of infection, then early antiviral therapy could theoretically eliminate further shedding without altering clinical outcomes. Moreover, if extremely high viral load periods are responsible for most transmissions as suggested by the 5-day generation time of infection (29) , then early elimination of shedding may not lower transmissibility either. Overall this result highlights the urgent need for studies which identify early viral and immune correlates of severe disease and .

transmissibility. Indeed, preliminary studies suggest that presenting viral load may impact disease severity (30) .
Fourth, if therapy is initiated during the pre-symptomatic stage of infection as may occur during post exposure prophylaxis (31) , then its effectiveness is predicated on high potency. Subtherapeutic small molecular agents may in fact prolong infection. Based on this result, we suggest sampling at late timepoints during post exposure prophylaxis trials.
Fifth, our approach suggests that while development of low-level drug resistance will occur commonly during COVID-19 treatment with remdesivir, it is unlikely to predispose to treatment failure provided the drug is potent against the predominant susceptible strain. Resistant variants will likely be present at low levels relative to susceptible strains making transmission of resistance far less likely. Important exceptions may occur in immunocompromised hosts who might shed respiratory viruses for longer and at higher levels, thereby increasing the chance of de novo resistance (32) , or in the context of only moderately potent antiviral therapy. Finally, our model projects a high likelihood of success for neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunotherapies provided that they achieve adequate potency and are dosed early.
In summary, our model provides a broad platform for assessment of all major types of therapies. Our results demonstrate the need to differentiate whether duration of viral shedding or viral area under the curve is the more relevant surrogate of severity. If viral area under the curve is most predictive of poor outcomes, then all forms of antiviral therapy outside of potent post exposure prophylaxis are unlikely to provide clinical benefit. However, if shedding duration is the best surrogate, then an early test and treat approach is highly promising for limiting the likelihood of severe disease.

We employed ordinary differential equation models to analyze the in-host SARS CoV-2 dynamics in infected individuals and the potential in vivo effect of different treatment strategies. First, we fit models to the viral load data from different sources using a nonlinear-mixed effects approach. Second, we used pharmacokinetics models to fits observed plasma concentration of remdesivir (RDV) and its active nucleoside triphosphate form in PBMCs, and blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Third, we simulated dose response curves for antiviral effect of RDV and HCQ using different possible half maximal effective concentration (EC50) based on in-vitro estimations against SARS-CoV-2. Fourth, we simulated therapy at different times during infection to analyze the potential reduction of SARS CoV-2 shedding. Finally, we repeated projections of therapy including the emergence of resistance to therapy.
We analyzed viral load data from patients infected with SARS CoV-2 that were monitored and received supported therapy in hospitals in Singapore (n=11), Germany (n=9), South Korea (n=1), and France (n=4). Patients who had less than 4 data points or had oscillatory viral dynamics were excluded.
The first data set was obtained from SARS Cov-2-infected patients followed at 4 hospital in Singapore from January 23 rd to February 23 rd , 2020 (7). All patients diagnosed stated to have travelled from Wuhan, China in the last two weeks of enrollment. Viral load observations were obtained from different specimens (blood, stool, and urine samples), but we analyzed those coming from nasopharyngeal swabs. Cycle threshold were obtained with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at multiple times during the first 2 weeks after enrollment.
The second data set was obtained from infected patients enrolled and treated in a single hospital in Munich, Germany from January 23 rd to January 27 th , 2020 (8) . For all patients, the infection was reported to happen after contact with an index case. Viral load observations were obtained daily from sputum, pharyngeal swabs and stool using RT-PCR. Here, we analyzed viral RNA concentrations from sputum.
The third data set comes from the first SARS Cov-2 infected case in Korea, a 35-year-old Chinese citizen coming from Wuhan, China (9) . Nasopharyngeal swabs viral loads were obtained daily from day 2 of symptoms onset using RT-PCR.
The fourth data set came from four patients admitted in hospitals in Paris or Bordeaux, France with viral loads obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR (10). We analyzed viral load data digitized from the published study.
When viral load observations were only published in cycle threshold (Ct) values we converted them to copies per swab using the relation values in (33). We assumed a lower limit of detection of 100 copies per sample.
PK data of HCQ specifically to 200 mg oral dose was gathered from (34) . PK data of RDV was gathered from (17), where non-Human Primates (NHPs) intravenously received RDV .

at 10mg/kg dose at day 0 and the plasma concentration of RDV and its active nucleoside triphosphate form in PBMCs were recorded over 24 hours. We digitize this data and employ it to fit PK model of RDV.
To understand the observed SARS-COV-2 shedding dynamics we developed a viral infection model modifying previous models of virus dynamics (12, (35) (36) (37) . In this model, susceptible cells (S) are infected at rate by SARS-COV-2 (V). SARS-COV-2-infected cells (I) are cleared in two ways: (1) by an innate response with density dependent rate ! (13, 14) ; and (2) an acquired response with rate "# ! # ! $% ! mediated by SARS-COV-2-specific effector cells ( ). The exponent describes by how much the first death rate depends on the infected cell density. The Hill coefficient parameterizes the nonlinearity of the second response and allows for rapid saturation of the killing. Parameter defines the effector cell level by which killing of infected cells by is half maximal. SARS-COV-2 is produced at a rate and cleared with rate . In the model, SARS-COV-2-specific effector cells rise after stages from precursors cells ( '()…+ ). The first precursor cell compartment ( ) ) proliferates in the presence of infection with rate ) and differentiates into the effector cell at a per capita rate during each intermediate stage. Finally, effector cells die at rate # . The best instance of the model is expressed as a schematic (Fig. 1a) and here as a system of ordinary differential equations: (1)
We fit different instances of our model in equation 1 to the SARS-COV-2 shedding data using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach (38-40) (See Table S1 ). Briefly, we obtained a maximum likelihood estimation of the population median (fixed effects) and standard deviation (random effects) for each model parameter using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm embedded in the Monolix 2019R2 software (www.lixoft.eu). For a subset of parameters, random effects were specified, and the standard deviation values were estimated. Measurement error variance was also estimated assuming an additive error model for the logged . We simultaneously fit each model to the viral load data of 25 patients form the four data sets. The parameters associated with the effector cell compartment were only estimated for those study participants who cleared infection during the observed data.
For each model fit we assumed = 0 as the time of first positive viral load for each person. However, we defined the initial value as the time of infection, i.e. when ( '+'. ) = 1 cell.

Since infection starts before the first detected viral load, we have that '+'. < 0. We fixed other initial values as ( '+'. ) = 10 3 cells, ( '+'. ) = 4/(. #'#( ) 7 , ) ( '+'. ) = 1 cell and '(8…+ ( '+'. ) = ( '+'. ) = 0. We fixed parameter = 15 day -1 (41), # = 1 day -1 (35), and = 100 cells. We assumed this value of because of the low percentage (~2%) of activated T cells that start growing at the moment of viral load drop (42) . We estimated the remaining parameters including the time of infection '+'. .
To determine the most parsimonious model among the instances for the available SARS Cov-2 shedding data, we computed the log-likelihood (log L) and the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC=-2log L+2m, where m is the number of parameters estimated). We assumed a model has similar support from the data if the difference between its AIC and the best model (lowest) AIC is less than two (43) .
To reproduce the PK data of RDV, we employed a simple two compartment model where the first compartment represents the amount of RDV in plasma ( 9 , volume 9 ) and the second compartment denotes the amount of its active nucleoside triphosphate form in PBMCs ( : , volume : ). Here, we assume that RDV gets metabolized to its active nucleoside triphosphate form at rate ;: whereas RDV and its active nucleoside triphosphate form are eliminated from their respective compartments at rates < and : , respectively. The model is given by, 9 = − ;: 9 − < 9 : = ;: 9 − : :
As the drug concentration was recorded in M, we convert the amount of the drug given in mg to M by dividing 9 and : by conversion factors ) and 8 , respectively. Here, ) and 8 are a combination of the volume of the distribution of two compartments and the molar mass of two forms of RDV. We fit this model to the PK data from NHP (17), using a non-linear least squares approach using an initial dose of 10mg/kg. We adapted the dose in humans (200mg and 100mg) assuming a normal weight of 70kg.
To recapitulate the pharmacokinetics of HCQ, we developed a model on pharmacokinetics models of chloroquine (CQ), as HCQ is a derivate of CQ and has the same active metabolites (44) . In this four-compartment model, the drug gets absorbed from the gut compartment ( = ) at rate : and enters the central compartment ( 9 , with volume ) ), where it is eliminated with at a rate < . The rate constants )8 and )> represent the movement of the drug from the central compartment to the first peripheral compartment ( 8 , volume 8 ) and the first peripheral compartment ( > , volume > ), respectively. Similarly, the movement of the drug from compartments 8 and > to the central compartment is modelled using 8) and >) , respectively. The modeling equations representing the amount of drug in each compartment is given by, .

We fit this model to the PK data using a non-linear least squares approach.
The pharmacokinetics of a intravenously injected broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAB) was simulated using a simple bi-phasic exponential model, ? ( ) = ) 2! " . + 8 2! % . (45) . In this model ) ad 8 represent the distribution and clearance rates of the bNAB whereas ) and 8 describe the coefficients associated with them. We fixed parameters ) = 2200 /mL, 8 = 150 /mL and ) = 1.1 day -1 following estimates for the bNAb VRC01 (23) . We also fixed . Thus, the antiviral effect of intracellular HCQ was calculated as ( ) =
We used values of EC50 from those estimates in vitro against SARS CoV-2 (0.72 μM for Hydroxychloroquine (47) , and 0.77 μM for Remdesivir (16) ) to hypothetical in vivo values up to 100 times the in vitro value.
We also explored the antiviral effect of a hypothetical bNAb using the form ( ) =
and varied values of EC50 between 1 and 1000 μM. Finally, we modeled the potential antiviral effect of immunotherapies by enhancing the early death rate of infected cells ( ) by a factor of 50%, 100% and 200%.
We adapted the model in equation 1 to allow for the emergence of resistance to RDV. We base the modifications on the fact that two separate mutations may induce partial resistance .

to RDV in SARS CoV-1 which in turn leads to a less fit virus (22) . In the case of SARS Cov-1, two single mutations can induce to a less sensitive virus with 2.4-and 5.0-fold increase in the RDV EC50. When the combined mutations emerged, it mediated a 5.6-fold increase in the RDV EC50. We included these findings in the model by assuming that infected cells ( H ) that produce sensitive virus ( H ) can transition into infected cells ( I) and I8 ) that produce less sensitive virus ( I) and I8 ), due to one mutation during the viral replication cycle. These two viral populations have an increased EC50 (2.4-and 5-fold higher). Similarly, we assumed that I) and I8 can transition into infected cells that produce a more resistant strain I)8 (with 5.6-fold higher EC50) after another mutation. We also allowed for reversal mutation events. We assumed a mutation probability of = 10 2F per infection event. Under these assumptions total viral load is defined as = H + I) + I8 + I)8 and total number of infected cells as = H + I) + I8 + I) 8 . With these modifications the model becomes, .

Treatment initiation is at timepoints generally consistent with hospitalization (day 10 after first positive sample), first symptoms (day 5 after first positive sample), pre-symptomatic post-peak phase (day 2 after first positive sample) or pre-symptomatic pre-peak phase (day 0). A. Projections of no treatment, treatment with no assumed drug resistance, and treatment with assumed drug resistance. B. Projections of assumed drug resistance with trajectories of sensitive strains, single mutants and double mutants.

Table S1: Akaike information criterion (AIC) for multiple instances of our model with different number of the compartments of ( ) and the hill-coefficient associated the effector cell response ( ). Lower the AIC, better is the support for the combination of parameters for our model. We found that = 2 and = 10 is best supported by the data (bold red). For comprehensive, we also tried a model with = 0 (i.e., no effector cell response), and a model with = 0 and = 0. In both cases, we found AIC~945, supporting the choice of our model. .
