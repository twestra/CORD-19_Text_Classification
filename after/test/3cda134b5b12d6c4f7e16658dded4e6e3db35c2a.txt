Question What are the risk factors for severe patients with corona virus disease 2019 ?
Findings First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Last, we also found that the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients.
Meaning This review summaried the risk factors of severe COVID-19 patients and aim to provide a basis for early identification of severe patients by clinicians.
Importance: With the increasing number of infections for COVID-19, the global health resources are deficient. At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in All rights reserved.

The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0.
Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc.
Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The findings are presented and discussed by different clinical characteristics. Therefore, our review may provide guidance for clinical decision-making and optimizes resource allocation.

In December 2019, COVID-19 was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] . On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2] [3] [4] . According to the WHO report [5] , as of 10:00 on March 23, 2020, a total of 334,695 confirmed cases and 14,526 deaths were reported in 140 countries and regions worldwide. While the epidemic in China is gradually under control, Europe and the Middle East have shown the signs of rapid spread. For example, Italy, Iran, Germany, Spain, the United States, South Korea and Japan have seen a sharp increase in the number of infections [5] .
Nowadays, with the increasing number of infections, the global health resources are extremely poor. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In this regard, we have summarized the published studies with critically ill patients aimed at explaining the risk factors of the NCP and providing Chinese experience for people around the world in responding to COVID-19.
For categorical variables, analysis was performed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding 95% CI were calculated. The heterogeneity was assessed by using the I 2 test, with I 2 >50 % indicating the existence of heterogeneity. If there is significant heterogeneity, a random effect model (DerSimonian-Laird method) was used to calculate the pooled effect; otherwise, the fixed model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used. Possible publication bias was evaluated via observing the symmetry characteristics of funnel-plots. If the number of included studies in each outcome was <10, the funnel plot was not performed due to limited power [9] . Data analysis was undertaken using STATA, version 15.0 (Stata Corp).
The main characteristics of the studies were summarized in Table 1 . All articles were observational studies. All the subjects are from China, including more than 30 provinces and cities. The study period spans from 11 December 2019 to 23 February 2020. About the comparison of mild and severe patients, 15 studies [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] described patient characteristics, 15 studies described comorbidities [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , 8 studies [1, 10, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23] described vital signs, 17 studies compared symptoms [1, [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] and 19 studies [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] described laboratory findings. Guan, etc'study included 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, and described the clinical characteristics of mild and severe patients in detail. Because of this article may be overlaps in population data with other studies, and the results are mainly described using median and quartile intervals, so we did not include the data in our meta-analysis, and mainly used descriptive analysis to compare the results with our studies.
A random-effects model (I 2 =54.4%) was used on 6 articles [

In addition, our research not only includes published studies, but for unpublished literature on medRxiv and bioxiv, as long as it meets our inclusion criteria, we also include them, aim to minimize publication bias.
This study shows the conclusive evidence as risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients, such as patient characteristics (age, gender, BMI), comorbidities (DM, HTN, CHD, COPD), vital signs (respiratory rate), symptoms (fever and dyspnea) and laboratory findings (blood routine, biochemical indicators, inflammatory biomarkers and coagulation).
At present, no special drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found and the research process of the vaccine is still in clinical trials, the treatment of COVID-19 is mainly by Symptomatic treatment. Based on Chinese experience, mild patients and their close contacts treated in close isolation and follow-up are likely to be sufficient to manage the disease [29] [30] [31] . But for severe patients, intensive care and aggressive treatments are needed. By searching various databases, we found that this is the first article of systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the characteristics of severely infected patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The article [1] of Guan, etc shows that the Median (IQR) age of critically ill patients was 52.0 (40.0-65.0) which was older than the non-critically ill patients whose median (IQR) age was 45.0 (34.0-57.0). Similarly in our review, we found that All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Moreover, the presence of coexisting illness (such as DM, HTN, CHD, COPD) was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease. We all know that the elderly with basic diseases, especially those with diabetes usually have a high blood glucose status for a long time, so their ability to defend against infection is low [32] . They are at high risk for various infections, and once infected, they can easily develop into severe diseases. The lower sensitivity of women to viral infections may be due to the protection from X chromosomes and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity [33] . So, we think that elderly male patients with underlying diseases are at high risk for severely ill with COVID-19 and needs special attention from clinicians.
In addition, our study also found that patients with high BMI are more likely to develop into severe pneumonia, which may be related to the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in obese patients [34] . We know that ACE2 is a binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has a very high affinity between them. Obese patients are richer in adipose tissue, have a larger total amount of ACE2 receptors [34] , and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. It is suggested that obese people are at high risk of COVID-19, and they are the key protection targets in epidemic prevention work.
The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sputum production, sore throat, fatigue or myalgia, dyspnea, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, chills and headache, etc. In most studies, the symptom of fever and dyspnea occur more frequently in pathogen that infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans and many other wild animals [37, 38] . SARS-CoV-2, also known as the sister virus of SARS-CoV, has 85% nucleotide homology [39, 40] . The latest pathology reports [41] found that the pathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar, mainly manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure, which also explains the cause of multiple organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect human respiratory epithelial cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on human cells [42, 43] . Many studies [34, 44] have found that the levels of ACE2 RNA was higher in heart, kidney, intestinal tract, gallbladder, adipose tissue and testicles than lungs in human body, which also explains the reason why multi-organ dysfunction is prone to occur in severe patients.
Inflammatory biomarker is also a common feature in the patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. In the study, we found that CRP and PCT increased in varying degrees for severe patients. Some research also reported the elevated level of ESR, IL-6, and IL-10 in critically ill patients [24] . It is considered that multiple cytokines are secreted after the infection of microorganisms causing a strong inflammatory response and the damage of immune system, indicated that critically ill patients may have more severe systemic inflammatory response, so attention should be paid to strengthen the treatment of anti-inflammatory [23] .
