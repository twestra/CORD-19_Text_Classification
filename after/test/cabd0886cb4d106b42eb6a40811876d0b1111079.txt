The world has been afflicted heavily by the burden of coronavirus disease 2019
The humankind is under continuous threat elicited by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is the full-blown manifestation of such a threat [1] [2] [3] . In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic [4] . The world was overwhelmed by the rapid escalation of events, exponential increase in the number of cases and mortality rate of the disease, which was reported in China, the first epicenter of COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] .
The novel respiratory disease COVID-19, has a median incubation period of 5 days (2-14 days) with most common symptoms including fever, dry cough and fatigue [8] . Other signs and symptoms that were reported to a lesser degree included productive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, sore throat and headache [9] .
With no specific antiviral treatment options available so far, the prevention of the disease remains the mainstay approach to halt the spread of the virus [10] . The preventive measures revolve mainly around social distancing and strict quarantine [11] . Avoiding crowded places and keeping a safe distance from anyone, are considered among the most important preventive measures, as SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted via droplets [12, 13] . Since the virus is also known to be transmitted through close contact, any form of physical social greetings should be avoided [12] . The preventative approach also includes: practicing regular hygiene and sanitation measures such as hand washing, constant disinfection of surfaces and wearing masks and gloves as appropriate [14] . Abstaining from travel and avoiding people who have been to countries highly impacted by the pandemic is of paramount importance [14] . It is crucial as well to prevent the spread of infection, which is done by practicing coughing and sneezing etiquette and self-isolating in case of suspected infection with the virus [11, 14] .
Despite the rapid increase in the number of publications regarding COVID-19 in the literature, some aspects of the disease have not been clearly identified yet. This vagueness can lead to a huge stream of misinformation about the virus and the disease [15] . These aspects involve the origin of the virus, availability of specific antiviral treatment and effective vaccine, in addition to questioning the accuracy of the recently developed diagnostic modalities [15] . In the current day and age, the widespread access to internet and the extensive use of social media outlets to get information can be a double-edged sword [16] [17] [18] .

However, this information might be faulty and can spread easily without having a credible source [16, 18, 19] .
The fear and anxiety that accompanied COVID-19 pandemic can have devastating effects on the mental health of people and might have a negative psychological and social impact [20, 21] . Providing accurate and timely information can result in clearance of vagueness and relief of anxiety [19] .
The conspiracy beliefs can be defined as unsubstantiated and implausible beliefs that involve the role of malevolent force in plotting major events, when other explanations are more probable [22] . Such beliefs can have negative health and social effects which were seen in the past and continue to exist to this day [23] . The striking example regarding the effect of conspiracy is the HIV epidemic in South Africa, where the belief in conspiracy resulted in governmental policies with devastating effects on public health [24] . Another example, is the vaccination conspiracy theories, with sinister outcomes manifested by re-occurrence of outbreaks of infectious diseases including measles, mumps and rubella [25, 26] .
Jordan was affected by COVID-19 similar to most countries of the world, with 381 reported cases and seven deaths as a result of the disease, at the time of manuscript writing [7]. On March 18 th , curfew and quarantine were first implemented in the country following earlier closure of schools and universities with recommendations to avoid large gatherings, which took place on March 15 th . The students in general and particularly university students were heavily affected by the conditions surrounding the disease including forced stay at home during the quarantine. Thus, the aims of the current study were to evaluate the overall knowledge about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 among the University of Jordan (UJ) students from different Schools. In addition, we aimed to assess the attitude of UJ students towards the perceived danger of the disease and the quarantine measures issued by the government.
Moreover, we sought to evaluate possible deleterious effects of conspiracy belief regarding the origin of COVID-19, particularly; the potential impact on knowledge and anxiety levels among UJ students. Finally, we aimed to investigate the sources of information about the disease among the students.

This study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that was distributed among students at UJ, which is the largest and oldest University in Jordan with about 49,000 enrolled students as of 2019/2020 Academic year [27] . Participation in the study was voluntary and an informed-consent was provided at the introductory section of the questionnaire (Supplementary File 1). Pilot testing involved distributing the questionnaire draft to seven participants (who did not take part in the final survey), which resulted in minor changes in language and content. The questionnaire was distributed in Arabic and comprised 26 items on socio-demographic information (age, nationality, gender, University program and School, marital status and monthly income of the family), conditions of living during the quarantine period, attitude regarding the perceived danger of the disease and towards the adherence to quarantine measures. To assess knowledge of the participants on the virus and the disease, several items were included that evaluated signs and symptoms, transmission routes, protective measures, therapeutic use of antibiotics, availability of vaccine for COVID-19, and belief in the assumption that summer heat can inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the survey items included a section on sources of information about the disease including social media platforms. A specific item was used to evaluate the belief of each participant that COVID-19 pandemic is part of a global conspiracy. Finally, a section to assess the anxiety level among participants was included and comprised seven questions with four potential responses.
Invitation to participate in this survey was distributed among UJ students via Facebook and WhatsApp. The survey was conducted from 29 th March 2020 (14:00) till March 31 st (16:00), thus spanning 50 hours.
The study was approved by the Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Forensic Medicine and by the Scientific Research Committee at the School of Medicine/UJ (Meeting #2 of the week 14, 2020 using WhatsApp conference call). Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. An informed consent was ensured by the presence of an introductory section of the questionnaire, with submission of responses implying the agreement to participate. All collected data were treated confidentially.

To evaluate the overall knowledge of each participant about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, a total of 12 items each worth of a single point were included with a correct response to each item being considered as a single point yielding a maximum score of 12. These items involved questions on signs and symptoms (five items with one point weight for each correct answer), routes of transmission (four items with one point awarded for each correct answer, and for blood transmission, non-selection was regarded as a correct answer), antibiotic treatment, availability of vaccine and effect of summer heat on the epidemic each worth a single point
for each correct answer.
We based the anxiety score system on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), which is a reliable and commonly used system to assess the level of anxiety [28] . This system is modelled based on four possible responses (not at all response was scored as zero, several days response was scored as 1, more than half the days was scored as 2 and everyday was scored as 3) to seven questions about their feelings during the past two weeks prior to survey in our study (the quarantine period, Supplementary File 1) [29] . The maximum score of 21 was regarded as the highest level of anxiety while zero was considered to represent the lowest level. GAD-7 scale of 0-4 indicates no anxiety, 5-9 indicates mild anxiety, 10-14 indicates moderate anxiety, and a score of 15 and above indicates severe anxiety [29] .
We used Chi-squared test (Ï‡ 2 ), Mann-Whitney U test (M-W), Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W) and two-sided t-test as appropriate. P-values less than 0.050 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 for Windows.

The total number of participants in the study who completed the questionnaire was 1540. The mean age of study participants was 22 years (median: 21 years, interquartile range (IQR): 20-22 years). Females predominated the study population (n=1145, 74.4%) and the majority were Jordanians (n=1386, 90.2%). Undergraduate students comprised 89.5% (n=1378) of the study participants and 43.1% (n=664) were students at Health Schools, with highest participation from the School of Dentistry (n=259, 16.8%), while the lowest number was from the School of Law (n=4, 0.3%, Supplementary File 2). The highest number of study participants reported a household monthly income of 500-1000 JDs (n=646, 41.9%). The vast majority of participants were single (n=1440, 94.1%, Table 1 ) and spent the last two weeks of curfew with their families (n=1407, 91.7%).
Regarding knowledge on signs and symptoms of the disease, fever was the most frequent sign to be correctly identified by the participants (n=1500, 97.4%) followed by shortness of breath (n=1448, 94.0%) and cough (n=1309, 85.0%).
For possible transmission routes of the virus, touching infected surfaces (fomites) was the most common route to be correctly identified (n=1485, 96.4%) followed by coughing and sneezing (n=1325, 86.0%). Close contact in crowded places was missed as a potential route of transmission in 21.0% of the participants (n=324). Transmission via blood was incorrectly identified by 17.8% of the participants (n=274).
Of the eight protective and control measures that were asked in the survey, the majority of participants precisely identified all protective measure (n=1193, 77.5%) and an additional 134 participants missed only a single protective measure out of the eight items in the survey (8.7%), followed by 85 participants who missed two items (5.5%).
Regarding the current lack of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority of participants provided a correct answer (n=1433, 93.1%). In addition, the majority of participants identified the useless effect of antibiotics in treating COVID-19 (n=1365, 88.6%).
Summer heat ability to inactivate the virus was incorrectly reported by 40.3% of the study participants (n=621).

Regarding the attitude of the participants towards the perceived danger of the disease, the majority reported that COVID-19 is moderately dangerous (n=1079, 70.1%) and 428 participants reported that the disease is very dangerous (27.8%). Males were more likely to report that COVID-19 is very dangerous compared to females (38.6% vs. 24.1%, p<0.001; Ï‡ 2 , Table 2 ). Jordanian participants had a significantly higher likelihood to report that the disease is very dangerous compared to their non-Jordanian colleagues (28.5% vs. 21.2%, p=0.020; Ï‡ 2 , Table 2 ). Participants with families of lower income were more likely to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous compared to those with higher income (38.0% vs. 22.1%, p<0.001; Ï‡ 2 , Table 2 ).
Higher level of anxiety was found more frequently among participants who felt the disease is more dangerous as estimated using anxiety scores (mean anxiety score of 8.1 among those who reported the disease as moderately dangerous, as opposed to mean anxiety score of 9.2 among those who reported that COVID-19 is very dangerous, p<0.001; K-W, Figure 1 ). 
The overall knowledge regarding the disease and the virus among the participants was generally high with 9.5 as the mean K-score. Older age was associated with higher level of knowledge (mean K-score: 9.7 vs. 9.3, p<0.001; t-test). Postgraduate students had higher mean K-score compared to their undergraduate counterparts (9.7 vs. 9.5, p=0.035; M-W). The highest mean K-score was found among students at Health Schools followed by the Scientific Schools, while the lowest mean K-score was found among the Humanities Schools (9.8 vs. 9.4
vs. 9.1, p<0.001; K-W). Higher mean K-score was observed among those who felt that COVID-19 is very dangerous compared to those who felt that the disease is moderately dangerous, however, without statistical significance (p=0.150; K-W). For gender, marital status, nationality and family income, no statistically significant differences were found as well.

The level of knowledge about COVID-19 was lower among participants who believed that the disease is part of a conspiracy, compared to those who did not have such a belief (mean Kscore: 9.0 vs. 9.7, p<0.001; M-W). In addition, the mean K-score showed a gradual decrease going from those who denied the existence of conspiracy to those who answered maybe, and ending in participants who had such a belief (mean K-score: 9.0 vs. 9.5 vs. 9.7; p<0.001; K-W, Figure 2 ).

Participants were students at the University of Jordan. K-W: Kruskal Wallis test.
For the whole study population, the mean anxiety score was 8.4 (median=8.0, IQR (5.0-12.0)).
Males showed lower level of anxiety compared to females (mean anxiety scores: 7.7 vs. 8.6, p=0.002; M-W). Higher level of anxiety was found among participants with the lowest monthly income as compared to the other two groups (8.9 vs. 8.3 vs. 8.1, p=0.043; K-W, Supplementary File 2). In addition, higher level of anxiety was also noticed among non-Jordanians, however, without statistical significance (mean anxiety score: 9.2 vs. 8.3, p=0.068; M-W). Nevertheless, significantly higher level of anxiety was found among non-Jordanian .

Anxiety scores were significantly higher among the study participants who believed that COVID-19 is the result of a global conspiracy compared to those who denied such a belief (mean anxiety score: 9.0 vs. 7.7, p=0.004; M-W). In addition, a gradual increase in the level of anxiety was observed moving from a mean score of 7.7 among those who did not believe in the role of conspiracy, to a mean score of 8.6 among those who answered maybe, and reaching the highest mean score of 9.0 among those who had such a belief (p=0.001; K-W, Figure 3 ). On the other hand, no significant differences in anxiety scores were observed for study level, Schools, nationalities and conditions of living during the quarantine.
The total number of participants who stated that COVID-19 is not part of a conspiracy was 518 representing 33.6% of the study population. On the other hand, 16.4% of the participants stated that they believe in the role of conspiracy in the origin of the disease (n=253), and those who answered maybe represented 49.9% of the study population (n=769).
Upon comparing different variables depending on whether the participants had a belief that COVID-19 is part of a global conspiracy or not, we found that females were more inclined to have such a belief compared to males (36.3% vs. 23.8%; p=0.001; Ï‡ 2 test). Those with lower income had higher likelihood to believe that the disease is the result of a global conspiracy (74.6% answered yes or maybe among participants with income <500 JD, compared to 59.0% who answered yes or maybe among participants with income >1000 JD, p<0.001; Ï‡ 2 test). In addition, the participants who believed in conspiracy had higher tendency to believe that there is a vaccine for COVID-19 (8.2% vs. 4.4%, p=0.001; Ï‡ 2 test), and to believe that the disease can be treated with antibiotics (13.7% vs. 6.8%, p<0.001; Ï‡ 2 test). Also, those who believed either entirely or indicated a possibility of conspiracy had the doubtful belief that summer heat will inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (45.8% vs. 29.5%, p<0.001; Ï‡ 2 test). Level of study, nationality and living conditions during the quarantine did not have statistically significant differences in relation to belief in conspiracy.

Participants were students at the University of Jordan. K-W: Kruskal Wallis test.
Regarding the most frequent sources of information about the disease and the virus that were reported by the students, the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH) website was the most frequent one (n=1018), followed by television programs and news releases (n=918), social media (n=913), medical doctors (n=684), scientific journals (n=462) and the UJ websites (n=362). The WHO website was the most frequent reported source of information mentioned in the "others" option (n=18). The majority of students reported more than one source of information about the pandemic (n=1238). For social media platforms, Facebook was the most frequent source of information (n=911), followed by Instagram (n=283), WhatsApp (n=270) and Twitter (n=209).

Knowledge and attitude surveys can be used as an asset to identify gaps in knowledge, certain misbeliefs and patterns of behavior. Such gathered information can be helpful to plan for better action especially in the current time where public appears vulnerable to media littered with piles of misinformation that lacks accuracy at times [16] . This misinformation can create a response that varies from full-fledged terror and panic to complete negligence, which can impede a successful response to the current pandemic in both ways [15, 19] . The response to COVID-19 requires cooperation of the public through following government-issued strict quarantine and social distancing measures, which are the best strategies to lessen the effects of the pandemic and to prevent collapse of health care system [14] . This also applies to university students where the conditions that accompanied the pandemic have resulted in psychological and educational difficulties [30] . The swift spread of COVID-19 pandemic was met initially by alertness of the public in some countries, confusion and panic in others. Panic could particularly be related to lack of accurate information about the pandemic [4, 31, 32] .
One of the main misconceptions is the presence of conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the virus itself [15, 33] . The interplay between virus evolution and dynamics of virus emergence, diversification and spread has been reviewed by Pybus and Rambaut [34] . Virus evolution by itself is not the sole factor for the increased incidence of infectious disease. [36] [37] [38] [39] . Thus, conspiracy theories regarding origins of viral diseases, including COVID-19 are not plausible on any scientific level. Currently, there is sufficient conclusive evidence that explains the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from bat reservoir [40, 41] . Other currently circulating misconceptions include the presence of effective treatment of COVID-19 using antibiotics (azithromycin) and antimalarial (hydroxychloroquine) that have not been proven as effective treatment yet, with variable and conflicting results [42] . In addition, a widespread belief that the pandemic will die out in summer, despite the absence of a clear cut evidence of such a notion. On the contrary, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Southern hemisphere might .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 21.20064147 doi: medRxiv preprint hint to the fallacy of such a claim. Thus, discernable effect of summer heat on the virus needs further scientific investigation to reach valid and conclusive evidence about this issue.
The main study findings are the following: students at the UJ displayed relatively high level of knowledge about COVID-19, which was shown by high mean K-score. More than 80% of the participants correctly identified the commonly reported signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough and shortness of breath). In addition, the students showed high level of knowledge regarding the transmission routes (fomites and droplet transmission through sneezing or coughing) and the preventive methods. This level of knowledge might be attributed to mass awareness campaigns via different media channels including the UJ, MoH, and news websites and their social media pages and accounts, besides the massive awareness campaigns on TV and the internet. Also, this result can stem from the desire of the students to actively seek knowledge about this disease that strongly affected their lives including educational, social and mental aspects. However, important gaps in knowledge regarding other possible modes of transmission were identified. This included about one-fifth of the participants missing the importance of crowded places as a possible setting for virus transmission. Such places can increase the chance of exposure to respiratory droplets, with the possibility of transmission from infected people lacking symptoms [13, 43, 44] . In addition, transmission via blood was incorrectly identified by 17.8% of the students. Despite concerns related to infrequent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in blood, no evidence of confirmed or even suspected blood-borne cases of COVID-19 were reported. This pattern was also seen in SARS and MERS, the two other recent emerging coronavirus epidemics [45, 46] . In addition, the participants had sufficient knowledge regarding the unavailability of an effective vaccine and the uselessness of antibiotics for COVID-19.
Regarding the attitude towards COVID-19 danger, males were more likely to perceive the disease as very dangerous compared to females. This perception can be ascribed to the financial and economic by-products of the pandemic and the quarantine, and their fear of what is at stake from the mandatory unemployment. Similarly, lower monthly family income was associated with higher perception of danger. As expected, participants who perceived the virus as very dangerous had higher levels of anxiety.
The vast majority of participants showed positive attitude towards the quarantine through following the government-issued rules. However, a minority (1.8%) stated that they broke the quarantine. Those were more likely to be males, married and postgraduate participants, and a possible explanation for their attitude is that they are the ones who venture outside to buy groceries or in case of emergencies.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 21.20064147 doi: medRxiv preprint Participants from Health schools had higher COVID-19 knowledge, compared to participants from the Science and Humanities Schools, which might be related to the possibility of having similar subjects in their curriculum, and their general understanding of diseases. Moreover, the mean K-score was also higher among the older and the postgraduate students, which seems plausible.
Based on the previous explanation in the Methods section, the results indicated that the study population had mild anxiety with an 8.4 mean anxiety score. Keeping in mind that a score of 10 and above warrants further psychological assessment and in some cases therapy, the UJ is advised to take an active reassuring approach towards the students, together with providing accurate and timely information about the disease. In addition, females had higher anxiety levels; females tend to worry and overthink more, leading to anxiety, as opposed to males who use distractions as a coping mechanism [47, 48] . Additionally, non-Jordanian females had significantly higher anxiety levels, and this can be the result of being abroad and probably spending the quarantine away from their families, causing them to be more anxious.
Participants with lower monthly income had higher anxiety level. This can be partially explained by the fact that the aforementioned group mostly depends on day-to-day income, with obvious financial impediments during the quarantine period.
Regarding the overall belief in the conspiracy in relation to the current pandemic, only a third of the participants rejected such a claim, whereas the majority of the students either believed entirely or at least had an inclination to believe in this dubious and even harmful notion. This harmful way of thinking might have negative consequences on people's psychological, social and health status. Examples of these negative impacts may include the possibility of racial abuse through distrustful view of other people and anti-vaccination campaigns [49] .
In general, those who believed in the conspiracy and even those who were skeptical about it, had lower knowledge about SARS-CoV-2. A tangible explanation for the belief in these conspiracies is the lack of proper knowledge about the disease. The results of the study also showed a clear relation between the belief in the conspiracies and the elevated levels of anxiety.
The majority of students who believed in the conspiracy were female participants and those with lower income. Participants who believed in the conspiracy were also more likely to believe that a vaccine is available and the disease can be treated using antibiotics. They also thought that summer heat is capable of inactivating the virus.
Finally, our results showed that the main sources of information for the students were the MoH website on COVID-19, TV, news releases and Facebook [50] . Thus, these media outlets .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 21.20064147 doi: medRxiv preprint should take a meticulous approach in rigorously reviewing the accuracy of information they provide about the disease, taking into account the reliance of public in general and students in particular on these sources to get knowledge about the current pandemic.
This study had several important limitations. First, an inevitable caveat in all surveys is the tendency of some participants to respond in a way they believe to be suitable for the researchers. Second, during sharing of the survey, it was emphasized to answer to the best of participants' knowledge, however there is never a guarantee that they followed such an instruction. Furthermore, willingness to participate, especially on an online-based survey, may have been limited. Another shortcoming was the female predominance in the sample and higher number of participants that were affiliated to Health and Scientific Schools. One important point should be clarified, which is related to the scoring system that was used to assess the level of knowledge among participants regarding COVID-19. This assessment tool might be arbitrary and subjective. In addition, the weight of each item can be criticized considering the difficulty in assessing the contribution of each item to overall COVID-19
knowledge. Thus, generalizability of our results in relation to this issue, should be made with extreme caution.

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic is not merely related to health issues, but also involves social and psychological effects. The results of this study highlight the negative effect of misinformation that is conveyed by media teeming with fallacies and assumptions that lack substantial evidence, particularly the belief in conspiracy role in the pandemic. The negative impact on UJ students was revealed by significantly higher level of anxiety and lower knowledge about COVID-19 in those who believed in these claims of conspiracy. This must be addressed by the main sources of knowledge that were identified by the participants (e.g.
MoH, TV, social media outlets), which are encouraged to have robust fact-checking processes, before conveying information about this unprecedented pandemic.
This study identified gaps in knowledge among UJ students about COVID-19, particularly among those studying at Humanities Schools. Thus, it is crucial to sustain and intensify the awareness and education of the students with evidence-based knowledge.
