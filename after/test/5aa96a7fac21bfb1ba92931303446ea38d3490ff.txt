The human conductive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to constrain invading respiratory pathogens. The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33°C and 37°C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Timeresolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus -host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.
In December 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is currently referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1-3 . The novel coronavirus has a close phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV, which emerged in China in 2002/2003 and led to over 8000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 800 deaths 4 . SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV by only 380 amino acids over its entire 30 kb genome and retains a high level of conservation in the receptor binding motifs that interact with the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 5 . Despite these similarities, there are currently over 2 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including more than 130'000 deaths 6 . Moreover, although the cell surface receptor ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 have been demonstrated to serve as entry determinants for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 2,7-9 , an accumulating body of evidence showing dissimilar human-to-human transmission dynamics and clinical courses between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strongly suggest the presence of different virus-host dynamics during viral infection in the human respiratory epithelium [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .
The human conductive respiratory tract is lined by a pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar epithelium with mucin-producing goblet cells and represents an important barrier to constrain invading pathogens. The anatomical distance between the upper and lower respiratory conductive tract, and their different ambient temperatures (32-33°C and 37°C, respectively 16, 17 ) have previously been shown to influence the replication kinetics of diverse respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and coronaviruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, the disparity in ambient temperature also affects virus -host immune response dynamics, and thus potential human-to-human transmission dynamics 23 . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected earlier after infection than SARS-CoV in upper respiratory tissues of infected patients 10, 13, 14, 24, 25 , suggesting that transmission kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics might differ between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Since viral load may reflect the dynamic interaction between viral replication and inhibition by cellular defence mechanisms, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the influence of different incubation temperatures on the viral replication kinetics and host immune response dynamics of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replication improved in hAEC cultures incubated at 33°C rather than 37°C and resulted in higher titers than SARS-CoV, while both viruses replicated equally efficiently at 37°C. Pretreatment of hAEC cultures with exogenous type I and III interferon (IFN) at different temperatures revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is equally sensitive to both type I and III IFN than SARS-CoV, thereby exemplifying the relevance of potent innate immune responses. Importantly, a detailed temporal transcriptome analysis of infected hAEC cultures corroborated initial findings and uncovered characteristic innate immune response gene signatures relating to the viral replication efficiency of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at different ambient temperatures. Altogether, these results provide the first in-depth fundamental insight on the virus-host innate immune response dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely phylogeneticallyrelated SARS-CoV, and likely reflect the clinical characteristics and transmission efficiencies of both viruses.
To assess the influence of the temperature variations that occur along the human respiratory tract, and to model virus-host interaction dynamics in distinct anatomical regions, we maintained well-differentiated hAEC cultures at either 33°C or 37°C throughout the experiment. hAEC cultures represent a wellcharacterized in vitro model that morphologically and functionally recapitulate the epithelial lining of the human respiratory tract in vivo. hAEC cultures from three different human donors were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2/München-1.1/2020/929 or SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 isolates using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The polarity of viral progeny release was monitored by collecting apical washes and basolateral medium in 24-hour intervals for a period of 96 hours. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early after infection in the upper respiratory specimens of infected patients 14,24,25 , we incubated virus-infected cultures at both 33°C and 37°C to mimic the ambient temperatures of the human upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively. At 37°C SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated equally efficiently for the first 48 hours, after which SARS-CoV showed, for 2 out of 3 donors, approximately 10fold higher apically released viral progeny titers than SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, when assessing viral replication efficiency at 33°C rather than at 37°C, it was apparent that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in 100-fold higher titers released in the apical compartment. In contrast, SARS-CoV replication at 33°C was significantly impaired and delayed until 72 hours post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 1b) .
Since the directionality of viral progeny release is crucial for subsequent virus spread and overall disease outcome, we also assessed whether SARS-CoV-2 was released to the apical surface, basolateral surface, or bilaterally. Similar to what we and others have observed previously for all other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 was predominantly released to the luminal surface (Supp . Fig 1a, b) 26, 27 .
To assess whether the observed differential temperature-dependent replication efficiencies are a result of the number of cells infected by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, hAEC cultures were fixed at 96 hpi and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, to discern potential preferential virus tropism to a distinct cell type, characteristic markers of the hAEC culture's architecture, such as the intercellular tight junctions (ZO-1) and the presence of cilia (β-tubulin IV), were also included. Microscopy investigations revealed that despite the more efficient replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 at 33°C, the overall fraction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells at 33°C and 37°C are comparable (Fig. 1c, d and Supp. Fig. 2a, b) .
Notably, at 96 hpi the majority of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive cells overlapped with the non-ciliated cell population (Fig 1c, d) . We previously observed that SARS-CoV infects both nonciliated and ciliated cell populations 26 , however, given that other reports show that SARS-CoV primarily targets ciliated cells 28 , we analysed the localization of the entry receptor, ACE2, and β-tubulin IV markers by microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ACE2 overlaps with both ciliated and non-ciliated cell populations in uninfected hAEC cultures (Supp. Fig. 3a ). In line with this, analysis of mRNA expression in non-infected hAEC cultures using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA are found in both secretory and ciliated cell populations (Supp. Fig. 3b-d) 29 . Combined these results demonstrate that despite their shared requirement on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for entry into host cells, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 display strong temperaturedependent variation in replication kinetics in hAEC cultures, suggestive of host determinants intervening .

Importantly, the significantly enhanced replication of SARS-CoV-2 at 33°C, likely supports the increased replication in the upper respiratory tract and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV.
The amount of viral progeny secreted from infected cells may reflect the dynamic interplay between viral replication and its inhibition by cellular defence mechanisms, such as by different types of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). To examine whether the induction of ISGs differentially affects SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication, hAEC cultures were pretreated with exogenous type I and III interferon (IFN), IFN-αA/D and IFN-ʎ3 respectively, for 18 hours prior to infection, at either 33°C or 37°C. Hereafter, the hAEC culture medium was replaced with IFN-free medium and cells were infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1, at 33°C or 37°C, for 72 hours. The titration of apically released virus revealed that at 37°C, SARS-CoV was less sensitive to type I IFN than to type III IFN, similar to previously reported observations (Fig. 2a, 24 hpi) 11 . At 33°C however, where its replication dynamics are delayed (Fig. 1b) , SARS-CoV displayed a similar sensitivity to type I and III IFNs (Fig. 2b) . In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 appeared equally sensitive to IFN-αA/D and IFN-λ3 at 37°C (Fig. 2c) , while being notably less affected by IFN-αA/D than IFN-λ3 at 33°C (Fig. 2d, 24 hpi) . Overall SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics were more severely impaired by IFN pretreatment compared to SARS-CoV, especially in conditions where type III IFN pre-treatment and infections were performed at 33°C (Fig. 2b, d) . 
The notable impact of incubation temperatures on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics Fig. 4a-b) . All DEGs were detected in SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected hAEC cultures, whereas no DEGs were identified for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3a, b and Supp. Fig. 4a-b) . Hierarchical clustering of the SARS-CoV-2 DEGs uncovered that irrespective of temperature, the overlap between time points is .

Interestingly, DEGs were identified as early as 48 hours at 37°C but not at 33°C (Fig. 3b) . Comparisons of DEGs of the 72-and 96-hour time points from both temperatures identified a core group of nine common ISG-related genes; IFI35, OASL, CMP2K, HELZ2, DDX60, MX1, IFI44L, ISG15 and IFIT3. Following the individual comparisons for SARS-CoV-2, we also performed pairwise comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to determine which genes were differentially expressed between these viruses. This revealed that irrespectively of temperature the most contrasting difference was observed at 72 hours (Supp. Fig. 4c,   d) .
To investigate the clustering results in more detail, we summarized the expression levels of the 139 unique DEGs among the 16 conditions (Fig. 3c) . This revealed a distinct temporal and temperature- showed an earlier and higher expression level at 37°C compared to 33°C (Fig. 3c) . To identify significantly enriched biological pathways over time at the different ambient temperatures, we performed pathway enrichment analyses on all unique DEGs detected in the comparison analyses for SARS-CoV-2. This illustrated a distinct temperature-dependent profile for diverse IFN and antiviral signalling pathways (Fig. 3d) . The 43 unique genes associated with these enriched pathways, including RIG-I/DDX58 and OASL, all displayed a clear temporal, temperature-dependent expression pattern that are inversely associated with the previously observed temperature-dependent viral kinetics difference for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3e, Fig. 1a, b, and Supp. Fig. 5 ). Of note, the delayed SARS-CoV replication kinetics at 33°C coincides with the upregulation of the viral restriction factor IFITM1 at 48 and 72 hours (Fig. 3e,   Fig. 1b) .
We previously observed, in the context of influenza A/H1N1 virus, that only a small fraction of infected cells produces IFN 31 , and because the majority of detected DEGs during SARS-CoV-2 infection were genes induced downstream of the IFN pathway, we sought to assess the individual expression of type I and III IFN genes over time. Despite IFNB1, IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 not being detected as significantly upregulated in our aforementioned DEG analyses (Fig. 3a-e) , their expression levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected hAEC cultures followed a similar temperature-dependent pattern as the ISGs highlighted in Figure 3e (Fig. 3f) . In contrast, and in agreement with previous results (Fig. 3a, e) , SARS-CoV infection only induced a minor elevation of IFNL2 at 37°C (Fig. 3f) , which correlated with the upregulation of the viral restriction factor IFITM1 at 48 and 72 hours (Fig 3c) . These results suggest that SARS-CoV infection triggers only mild IFN induction, and that similar to influenza A/H1N1 virus, type III IFNs have a more dominant roles in the antiviral defence 31 .
Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV induce disparate, virus specific and temperature-dependent host responses that inversely correlate with the previously observed dissimilar viral replication efficiencies at temperatures corresponding to the upper and lower respiratory tract. The majority of DEGs are related to the antiviral and pro-inflammatory . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In the current study, we demonstrate that the ambient temperatures reminiscent of the conditions in the Although SARS-CoV-2 replication was strongly potentiated at 33°C, no noticeable differences as to the number of infected cells, was observed between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected cultures. Given that the viral S protein receptor binding motifs interacting with the human receptor ACE2 are highly conserved between the two viruses and that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 displayed a similar cell tropism, the 380 amino acid dissimilarities distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV account for their differential replication efficiencies 2,7-9 . Another factor that may have influenced our results is the 29-nucleotide truncation in the ORF8 gene of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1, which was maintained in the SARS-CoV lineage that initiated the international spread of SARS-CoV. Indeed, Muth and colleagues demonstrated that an intact ORF8 invoked 10-fold higher replication kinetics at 37°C in various cell culture models, including hAEC cultures 32 . Therefore, besides comparing the replication of different SARS-CoV ORF8 variants at the temperature corresponding to the upper respiratory tract, it would be equally compelling to assess the phenotypic influence of similar truncations in the ORF8 gene of SARS-CoV-2, especially since several SARS-CoV-2 isolates bearing a 382-nucleotide deletion truncating the ORF8 gene have been detected 33 . Such SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 variants can be readily engineered using the reverse genetic system recently established in our laboratory 34 .
In our study, we report different temperature-dependent viral replication efficiencies for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, inversely associated with the amplitude of the innate immune response, albeit .

Foxman and colleagues elegantly described, in an analogous model to the human AEC cultures and by using common cold viruses, that the PRRmediated IFN response is influenced by temperature 23 . While this may also apply in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is likely that the efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the concurrent expression of a plethora of known coronavirus antagonists of the antiviral response also play a crucial role herein [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Nonetheless, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to both type I and III IFN than SARS-CoV. These data are supported by Lokugamage and colleagues, where type I IFN pretreatment in Vero cells resulted in a similar outcome 41

All images were processed using Fiji software packages 47 . Brightness and contrast were adjusted identically to their corresponding controls. Figures were assembled using the FigureJ plugin 48 .
Viruses released in the apical or basolateral compartments were titrated by plaque assay on Vero-E6 cells. Shortly, 1.7E5 cells/ml were seeded in 24-well plates one day prior to the titration and inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus solutions. Inoculums were removed 1.5 hpi and replaced with overlay medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1.2% Avicel (RC-581, FMC biopolymer), 5% heatinactivated FBS, 50 mg/ml streptomycin and 50 IU/ml penicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 48 hours, fixed with 4% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet.
Total cellular RNA from mock and virus-infected hAEC cultures was extracted with the NucleoMag RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according manufacturers guidelines on a Kingfisher Flex Purification system (Thermofisher). Total RNA concentration was quantified with QuantiFluor® RNA System (Promega) according manufactures guidelines on a Cytation 5 multimode reader (Biotek). A total of 100 ng of total cellular RNA was used for the generation of Bulk RNA Barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) libraries, and the subsequent sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform was done as previously described at a depth of 3 -4 million raw reads per sample 30 . The sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the BRB-seqTools suite 30 , and were aligned against a concatenation of the human gene annotation of the human genome (hg38), SARS coronavirus Frankfurt 1 (AY291315) and SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan-Hu1/2020 (NC_045512) viral genomes using STAR and HTSeq for producing the count matrices. All downstream analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.1). Library normalization and expression differences between samples were quantified using the DESeq2 package, with a cut-off of fold change (FC) ≥ 1.5 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. Pathway enrichment analysis and data visualization was performed with a variety of R-packages [49] [50] [51] .
For the analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression we reanalysed the previous obtained raw sequencing data 31 . The resulting unique molecule identifier (UMI) count matrix of each individual sample was pre-processed, filtered individually and merged in Seurat (v3.1). Data scaling, normalization and regressing out unwanted sources of variation (number of UMI's, mitochondrial content, cell cycle phase) was performed using integrated SCtransform option, followed by dimensional reduction using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) embedding. For cell type annotation, the resulting integrated dataset was used for unsupervised graph-based clustering to annotate the different cell types using both cluster-specific marker genes and well-known canonical marker genes to match identified clusters with specific cell types found in the respiratory epithelium, as previously described 31 .
