As we calculate analytic to link the coefficient of third-order polynomial equations from raw data of an Asean to the SEIR model. The Reproductive index depending on the average incubation period and the average infection period and the coefficient polynomial equations fitted from raw are derived . We also consider the difference of the average incubation period as 5 days and 3 days with the average infection period as 10 day of an Asean. We find that the value of 0
An Asean (The Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is consist of 10 ten member states as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Cambodia. And we try to predict the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) victims as number of persons who caught the infection and got sick only in this area. The complicated mathematical models are necessary for long-time predictions. The SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model are used to obtain the prediction values of the model parameters using the statistical approach for predication the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons [1, 2] . The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Death (SIRD) Model was used to formulate an optimal control problem with an expanded epidemic model to compute (Non-pharmaceutical) implementation strategy. [3] A modify SIR called SEIRUS model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Removed -Undetectable -Susceptible) is generated for evaluate the new deterministic pandemic Covid-19 endemic that originally developed for the control of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa. [4] The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model was adopt to be SEIRNDC [5] that the total population size N with two extra classes "D" mimicking the public perception of risk regarding the number of severe and critical cases and deaths; and "C" representing the number of cumulative cases. This model proposed the compartmental model that sustained human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 after December 2019 of Wuhan, China.

We apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model [7] (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) for the prediction properties of how a disease spread. The variable description is ( ) is number of susceptible populations, E(t) is the number of exposed populations, ( ) is number of infected populations, ( ) is number of infected populations quarantined and expecting recovery at time. There is no emigration from the total population and there is no immigration into the population. A negligible proportion of individuals move in and out of at a given time that
The people susceptible are able to get infected when they contact infectious people. Once infected, they move into the infectious compartment. People recovered are assumed to be immune within our study horizon. Then

The reproductive rate or the reproductive index, R0 is the course of an epidemic shape. It represents the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. For high value of R0, the number of newly infected people climbs more quickly to a maximum than low value of 0 R . The higher R0, the higher infectious population are.

When the spreading of viruses in a population occurred, the number of new cases rises rapidly, peaks, and then declines called the epidemiological curve. The spreading curve should be the flatten as the spreading the infections out of time. In this paper, we model the shape of spreading rate to be the third-order polynomial that we called "bellshape ". According to the total accumulate infected cases, the shape of curve should be gotten the saturation value so that the rate of infectious should be the bell-shape at the end of disease spreading. After analysis the raw data, we find that the daily new cases of Asean are divided into 2 cases; the bell-shape and no bell-shape. The bell-shape cases mean that the infection is in the state of the beginning of the saturated status as we can find the maximum value and we cannot find the maximum value for no bell-shape case.
However, both cases can be solve to find the 0 R .

As there are only 4 countries that have enough data to fit well with third-order polynomial; Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. There for, Philippines also has enough data but raw data show the swing-type behavior so the third-order polynomial equation cannot fit well, while the other country have not enough data to conform our .

The raw data of Indonesia and Singapore have shown that these countries take more time than the other country to get a peak. So, their curves do not show the Bellshape at the time of consideration. However, we can calculate the R0 of them that are 6.22 and 7.97 for Singapore and Indonesia, respectively. The high value of the R0 mean that they will take more time to get a peak and the infective population will be abundant if government do nothing.
In this situation, the external stimulus is need for stimulate the system to exhibit the new character such as the FitzHugh -Nagumo equations [12, 13] . The Eq.(5) is similar to the FitzHugh -Nagumo equations then we add the external stimulus ,
The external stimulus will reset the variable of system to become new value. If the external stimulus exceeds a certain threshold value, the system will generate a new behavior. In our model, we need the external stimulus to reduce the exponential increase .

However, the peak of infected rate is not found for Singapore and Indonesia at the time of consideration. The model of external stimulus on raw data are added into polynomial equation of Singapore and Indonesia to control the Covid-19. We find that Singapore need more the magnitude of external stimulus than Indonesia. However, the external stimulus for 14 days can stimulate to occur the peak of infective daily case of both country.
