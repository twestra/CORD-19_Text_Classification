Background: It is well-known that public health education plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, but how health providers should advise families and parents to obtain health education information is a challenging question. With COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice.
: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Results: Of 1067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious
.
Since late 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has become the most urgent public health issue threatening lives over the world (1) . The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus, and it usually presents manifestations of pneumonia that takes a severe form in approximately 20 percent of confirmed patients (2) . As of March 30th, 2020, over 720,000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients have been diagnosed globally, and the number will probably continue to increase until the epidemic trend tempers, which caused a significant impact on the health care and economy of affected areas. With over 200 countries affected and thousands of deaths, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (3) . It is well-known that public health education plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but how health providers advise families or parents to obtain health education information is a challenging question. In the context of a public health emergency, health education practice was often neglected or unprepared. This rapid review focuses on this .

A rapid review has emerged as a helpful approach to provide actionable and relevant evidence in a timely and cost-effective manner (4) . Rapid reviews, as well as rapid advice guidelines, should be conducted in a limited time to offer prompt evidence for the public health emergency. This review intends to support a rapid advice guideline for children with about how health providers should advise families and parents to obtain health education information on SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were various existing methods to expedite the conduct of a rapid review, yet we followed the WHO rapid review practical guide (4) .
The pre-search found that the most original studies on the topic were cross-sectional surveys, and the participants were people from non-specific groups rather than parents.
However, a health education strategy is urgently needed to help prevent the disease. So, it was implied that this rapid review would use indirect evidence to draw the conclusion.
We expanded the search range to SARS and MERS, since these two other coronaviruses have similar transmission routes and clinical outcomes as SARS-CoV-2.

We included observational studies, such as cohort and cross-sectional studies, that focused on the health education and health promotion issues during COVID-19, SARS, and MERS epidemics. We included studies with participants from the general public.
We excluded studies only focusing on specific groups, like different occupations.
Duplicates, studies with specific data missing, studies where full-text was unavailable, comments and letters were also excluded.

Any discrepancies were discussed or solved with a third researcher (Q Li). We used the bibliographic software Endnote. In Step 1, all titles and abstracts were screened using the pre-defined criteria, and studies will be sub-categorized into three (potentially eligible, excluded, and unsure) groups. In Step 2, full-texts of potentially eligible and unclear studies were reviewed to identify the final inclusion. All reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies were recorded, and the process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram (6).
Two researchers extracted the data independently using a structured form. Then the forms were cross-checked to ensure the data accuracy. If any disagreements occurred, they were resolved by discussion. We extracted the following data: 1) study characteristics, including the first author, publication year, and the country or area; 2) participants' characteristics; 3) aims of survey, and the sample size; and 4) the education resources mentioned in surveys.
Two researchers (W Li and J Liao) independently assessed the potential bias of the studies. All discrepancies in quality ratings were discussed with a third researcher (Q Li).

For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and its corresponding 95% CI when means and standard deviations (SD) were reported. If sufficient data were available, we considered examined the robustness of meta-analyses in a sensitivity analysis.When effect sizes could not be pooled, we reported the study effectives narratively.
The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (8). The criteria mainly considered included study methodological quality, directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of data, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication .

As COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern and the situation is evolving rapidly, our study was not registered in order to speed up the process.
Our rapid review included 24 cross-sectional survey studies (9-32) ( Figure 1 and Table   1 ) with a total of 35,967 participants, conducted during the COVID-19, SARS and MERS epidemic. Six anonymous network sampling surveys (9-14) were conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the other 18 surveys (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) were for SARS and MERS. Nine studies (11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 43, 44) mentioned the channels from where people obtained health education information. We also found out three studies about health education campaigns (33-35).
Seven studies (15, 20, 24, 26, (30) (31) (32) revealed that the public did not know how to face emerging infectious diseases. However, three surveys (9,10,12) showed that people had good knowledge attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19, yet it is necessary to strengthen the community publicity, and the health education of residents. One survey (10) revealed that most Chinese residents are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices (like wearing mask) towards showed that myths, fear and stigmatization of potential .

Another study (37) revealed that emerging health hazards were over-reported in mass media in comparison to the common threats to public health. A survey (26) from Saudi Arabia suggested that epidemiological knowledge received by the public was inadequate, and their recognition of MERS-CoV relied on the clinical manifestations, rather than epidemic features. Age≤30 years, male gender, and not having tertiary education were independent predictors of poor epidemiological knowledge.
Five studies (19, 21, 23, 25, 27) showed that pilgrimage travelers lacked awareness of infectious diseases. The Middle East, where MERS outbroke, is also a region with a great number of religious pilgrimage sites. A study in Australia evaluated pilgrims' awareness of MERS-CoV during travel, preventive measures, and the contact with camel exposure, and found that only 28.0% of Australian pilgrims knew that Saudi Arabia was affected by the MERS-CoV outbreak (23).

We explored the current information-seeking strategies and preferences. Two surveys (11, 13) showed that participants tended to obtain the COVID-19 information through Internet, social media by cellphone. One survey (18) (22) compared the sources of information used by the public during the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 epidemic in 2010 and found that traditional mass media were still the most commonly used sources for information in both groups of surveys.

More and more people are using multiple sources for information:
the proportion of people following at least five sources for information has increased by 60.0% between 2003 and 2010.
A survey (10) were also more behavior changes (P<0.01) in the prevention of SARS, which fully testifies the effect of comprehensive health education publicity (15) . Another study showed that the awareness of four items of MERS knowledge was significantly higher after a health education intervention than before (P<0.01). The health behavior formation rate of MERS was also higher after the intervention than that before (P<0.01) (23).

The world has experienced several acute public health emergencies requiring global coordination. Since the global epidemic of SARS in 2003, many institutions and organizations have launched health education programs ( Table 2) . It is worth mentioning that the British government launched a public information campaign on coronavirus quickly after the diagnosis of the first local SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform citizens how to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.
Because of the limitations in the type of study we could not perform the assessment of quality of evidence using GRADE. Overall, the included surveys had acceptable design and reporting quality ( Table 3) , but the sampling methods were not described with sufficient details in some studies. Many online surveys had a large sample size but their reliability was questioned.
Improved public health awareness for emerging infectious diseases plays a critical role in at least two ways. On one hand, appropriate behavior of the public, like adhering to self-quarantine and practicing the necessary hygienic habits will definitely slow down the spreading and help control the epidemic. On the other hand，outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases can often lead to negative social phenomena such as fear, stigma, and discrimination (36). Individuals who are feared and stigmatized may deny early .

The general public may lack adequate knowledge about emerging infectious diseases, and this situation may be even worse in special groups, like children, the elderly, travelers, and other vulnerable groups. This review found that the uneducated and young people lacked appropriate information about infectious diseases and adequately behavior in this outbreak (26). Children may have difficulties in understanding of mass health education. Parents have an obligation to explain disease prevention measures to their children. Furthermore, they should help children to be aware of infectious diseases.
We identified three studies (38-40) that evaluated the health care staff's knowledge of SARS or MERS, and found out the importance of providing related health education to them.
In the context of globalization, the speed and mode of infectious disease transmission have changed substantially. An outbreak of an infectious disease commonly restricted in .

The survey of MERS knowledge among pilgrimage travelers could insinuate a similar condition in SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, and essentially everyone is susceptible as there is no vaccination or natural immunity. Therefore, travelers should pay attention to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tourist destinations when arranging family travel or overseas study tours, especially while the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still ongoing.
Two studies (43, 44) showed that health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. With the development of new media, people can now draw information from multiple sources, and through mobile devices basically at any time and place.
Social media like Facebook, Twitter and WeChat are full of SARS-CoV-2 news and health education resources, which is convenient for the phone users. However, fake news and gossips are spreading fast, just like the virus. We appeal for the media and publishers to take deep consideration before post any information to the public. Official websites of the WHO and the national CDC are updating information about the epidemic and necessary preventive measures, and it is suggested for the publisher to cite and follow them.

This way the core information required by the public will transmit to the public in a timely, accurate, and appropriate manner (18).
Although we have collected data on some health education and promotion campaigns or programs in the world, we still need a wide influenced and persistent-actioning campaign to face the outbreak of the novel infectious disease. The outbreaks of SARS， MERS, Ebola and COVID-19 have given us every time a lesson for solidarity and collaboration . Suffering from the pain of lost lives, health education campaigns should be launched as early as possible to slow down the spread immediately.
Our rapid review provides evidence of the importance and urgency of health education.
Boosting health education to improve public health awareness for infectious diseases is urgently needed, especially for some vulnerable groups. Considering that information from the social media may be unreliable, the public including parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization and national Center for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.
