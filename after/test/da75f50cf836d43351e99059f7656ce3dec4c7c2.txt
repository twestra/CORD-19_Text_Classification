Background: Early differential diagnosis of suspected pediatric patients is difficult during the 2019-nCoV epidemic.
Objective: To identify clinical characteristics and key points of early differential diagnosis.
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on suspected pediatric cases.
Results:A total of 77 suspected cases were admitted from Jan 22nd to Mar 1st. Compared with non-2019-nCoV group (n=33),2019-nCoV confirmed group (n=35) had fewer fever (OR[95% CI] 0.39[0.242-0.628];P<.001) and symptoms of ARI (0.454[0.287-0.719];P<.001),more asymptomatic (15.086[2.117-107.475];P<.001), and more family cluster infections (5.469[2.405-12.433]; P<.001),while chest CT had more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.813[1.131-2.908];P=.014).There were significant statistical differences between the two groups in age (7.2[3.9-11.4] vs 5[2.1-7.8];P=.031),body temperature (36.7[36.2-36.9] vs 37[36.7-37.9];P=.001), heart rate ([97.1±16.8] vs [109.7±15.6];P=.002),percentage ([39.4±14.9] vs [52.5±17.5]; P=.001) and count (2.25[1.43-3.53] vs 3.33[2.8-5.18];P=.007) of neutrophil, percentage (45.3[39.2-56.6] vs 33.2[22.7-42.5];P=.001) of lymphocyte,hs-CRP (5.52[1.1-9.04] vs 9.04[7.35-9.54];P=.002) and PCT (0.05[0.03-0.08] vs 0.1[0.05-0.21];P<.001),while gender (42.9% vs 57.6%;P=.332),respiratory rate (22[20-22] vs 22[20-24];P=.092),WBC (5.37[4.67-8.08] vs 6.94[5.72-8.87];P=.198), lymphocyte count (2.68[1.99-4.01] vs 2.26[1.66-2.92];P=.096),Hb (128[124-142] vs 130[119-137];P=.572) and PLT ([279.1±77.5] vs [263.4±65.1];P=.37) were statistically insignificant.
Conclusions: Asymptoms or mild symptoms,positive CT findings and family cluster infection are the main clinical characteristics of infected pediatric patients. The CBC, hs-CRP and PCT can provide an important basis for early differential diagnosis.
Compared with other non-bacterial infections,hs-CRP and PCT in 2019-nCoV infection are reduced,but further evidence is needed to support whether their reduction is specific.
Children are naturally susceptible to various respiratory viruses due to their imperfect immune functions.Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV began in Wuhan city,Hubei province,China. 1-2 more than 2,000 pediatric cases have been reported nationwide in just over two months. 3 Limited by accuracy of nucleic acid detection, 4 relative reagent shortage and non-specificity of imaging findings, 5 early differential diagnosis of suspected pediatric patients with 2019-nCoV infection is difficult to some extent.Obviously,this has a serious impact on timely triage,the following reasonable treatment,early removal of isolation, and improvement of psychological stress in children.
At present, a growing number of studies have focused on diagnosis and treatment of confirmed cases, but few data are available on clinical characteristics and early identification of suspected pediatric patients with 2019-nCoV infection as a special population. We aimed to investigate and identify the clinical characteristics and explore the key points of early differential diagnosis, so as to provide a basis for the follow-up timely and reasonable treatment and effective implementation of prevention and control measures.
Children are defined as being less than 18 years old. Referring to the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia (the sixth edition draft) issued by the National Health Commission of China. [6] [7] Suspected cases are defined as having a clear epidemiological exposure, with or without clinical manifestations, and with or without positive CT findings.Epidemiological exposure includes close contact with confirmed cases,and or living or traveling in endemic areas (especially Hubei province), and or presence of confirmed case in their residential communities. If nasopharyngeal swab or anal swab specimens tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid using RT-PCR assay,suspected case is identified as a confirmed case.

From Jan 22nd to Mar 1st, a total of 77 suspected pediatric patients were admitted, and 39 (50.6%) were confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection, including 3 (3.9%) cases of RSVcoinfection, and 1 (1.3%) case with INF B coinfection.5(6.5%) of 38 (51.6%) cases of non-2019-nCoV infection were excluded by laboratory results and CT scan,consisting of 3 (3.9%) cases with PCT greater than 0.5ng/mL,were considered as bacterial infection,and 2 (2.6%) cases were considered as MP were statistically insignificant (details in Table 1 ).

[8] [9] 17 Therefore, it is necessary to start from other clinical features and laboratory data, independent of nucleic acid detection and chest CT, to provide a basis for early differential diagnosis.
As children age, their range of activities increases and their contact with the outside world increases. As a viral infection, it is obvious that children are especially susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection. The age distribution of the infected children we observed also conforms to this feature, and most of them are asymptomatic or mildly febrile and or symptoms of ARI. 3, 21 However, the changes of chest CT are more typical of viral pneumonia, 16 which is consistent with the results of other relevant reports. Also,from the 2019-nCoV cases with coinfection we excluded, they all had fever and symptoms of ARI, chest CT findings of viral pneumonia were also typical.
Therefore, 2019-nCoV with other viral coinfections may be more common in children. 8 Pediatric patients should be alert to the possibility of coinfection if severe symptoms appear.Compared with other non-bacterial pathogens,2019-nCoV has more family cluster infections, which indicates that the virus is more infectious and has the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission.

For the last two decades, most of studies planned to evaluate the roles of biomarkers in defining the etiology of pediatric CAP have been carried out by using, alone or in combination, WBC count, neutrophil percentage, and serum hs-CRP and PCT concentration. 23 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
