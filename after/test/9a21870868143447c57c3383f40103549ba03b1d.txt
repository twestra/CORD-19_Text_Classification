Detection of pathogenic sequences or variants in DNA and RNA through a point-of-care diagnostic approach is valuable for rapid clinical prognosis. In recent times, CRISPR based detection of nucleic acids has provided an economical and quicker alternative to sequencing-based platforms which are often difficult to implement in the field. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a highly accurate enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences, identifying nucleobase identity and inferring zygosity with precision. We demonstrate that FELUDA output can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications including rapid diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. : bioRxiv preprint optimization for every variant and Cas13 requires conversion to an RNA template prior to detection, both of which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for diagnosis. Taken together, development of a detection pipeline based on a highly specific CRISPR protein with a direct binding or cleavage based readout can significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and cost of CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for point-of-care (POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction components are not feasible.
The rise of CRISPR Cas9 based approaches for biosensing nucleic acids has opened up a broad diagnostic portfolio for CRISPR products beyond their standard genome editing abilities 1, 2 . In recent times, CRISPR components have been successfully used for detecting a wide variety of nucleic acid targets such as those obtained from pathogenic microorganisms or disease-causing mutations from various biological specimens [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . At the heart of such a detection procedure lies the property of CRISPR proteins to accurately bind to target DNA or RNA, undergo conformational changes leading to cleavage of targets generating a reporter-based signal outcome [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . To enable such a detection mechanism to be foolproof, sensitive and reproducible across a large variety of targets, the accuracy of DNA interrogation and subsequent enzyme activity is extremely critical, particularly when clinical decisions are to be made based on these results 1,2 .
Current technologies relying on using CRISPR components for nucleic acid detection can sense the identity of the target either through substrate cleavage mediated by an active CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or by binding through a catalytically inactive RNP complex. Cleavage outcomes are then converted to a reporter-based readout with or without signal amplification. Among the CRISPR proteins that have been used so far, Cas9 and Cas12 or their inactive forms have been predominantly employed for detecting DNA sequences while Cas13 has been used for both DNA and RNA sequences. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and limitations that are related to sensitivity, specificity and read-out modes for an accurate diagnosis. The primary focus of these platforms is towards detection of low copy numbers of nucleic acids from body fluids of patients where signal amplification through collateral activity of fluorescent reporters has been proven to be advantageous. For genotyping individuals with high confidence, including careers of a single nucleotide variant (SNV), Cas12 requires individual sgRNA design and
We have recently reported a Cas9 ortholog from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) showing very high mismatch sensitivity both under in vitro and in vivo conditions [16] [17] [18] . This is based on its negligible binding affinity to substrates that harbor mismatches, a property that is distinct from engineered Cas proteins showing similar high specificity 19 . We reasoned that FnCas9 mediated DNA interrogation and subsequent cleavage can both be adapted for accurately identifying any SNVs provided that the fundamental mechanism of discrimination is consistent across all sequences ( Figure   1A ). We name this approach FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) and demonstrate its utility in various pathological conditions including genetic disorders and infectious diseases including disease outbreaks like COVID-
To identify a SNV with high accuracy, we first sought to investigate if FnCas9 can be directed to cleave the wild type (WT) variant at a SNV by placing an additional mismatch in the sgRNA sequence specific to the SNV. To test this, we selected sickle cell anemia (SCA), a global autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by one point mutation (GAG>GTG) [23] [24] . We identified an sgRNA that can recognize the main disease causing point mutation (GAG > GTG) on account of a PAM site in the vicinity ( Figure 1B) . We then fixed the position of this mutation with respect to PAM and changed every other base in the sgRNA sequence to identify which combination led to complete loss of cleavage of a wild type substrate in an in vitro cleavage (IVC) assay with FnCas9 ( Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A ). We found that two mismatches at the 2 nd and 6 th positions away from the PAM completely abrogated the cleavage of the target ( Figure 1B ). Similarly other combinations (2 and 7, 2 and 8, 2 and 9, and 2 and 12, numbers referring to positions away from PAM) also abolished the cleavage, although to slightly lower levels ( Figure 1B) . Notably, on the SCA substrate, the 2 and 6 mismatch combination produced near complete cleavage suggesting that this combination may be favorable for discriminating between WT and SCA substrates ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, the same design principle can guide the allelic discrimination at every SNV that appears in these positions upstream of the trinucleotide NGG PAM in DNA.
We performed FELUDA with 4 synthetic sequences corresponding to SNVs reported for the Mendelian disorders like Glanzman's Thrombasthenia, Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), Glycogen Storage Disease Type I and X linked myotubular myopathy and observed an identical pattern of successful discrimination at the SNVs .

Taken together, these experiments suggest that FELUDA design can be universally used for detection of SNVs and and would not require extensive optimization or validation steps for new SNVs. To aid users for quick design and implementation of FELUDA for a target SNV, we have developed a webtool JATAYU (Junction for Analysis and Target Design for Your FELUDA assay) that incorporates the above features and generates primer sequences for amplicon and sgRNA synthesis (https:// jatayu.igib.res.in, Supplementary Figure 2 ). We next tested FELUDA in DNA from 6 SCA patients and a healthy control and found that in every case, the SC mutation containing substrates were cleaved to give a distinguishable signature while the WT substrate remained intact (Supplementary Figure 3A ). To establish that enzyme specificity for position-specific mismatches with respect to PAM site is the fundamental reason for this discrimination, we designed the mismatch combinations such that cleavage will occur only for the WT substrate and observed identical results thus confirming our hypothesis (Supplementary Figure   3B ). Notably, a simple agarose gel electrophoresis can be employed for this discrimination suggesting that FELUDA can be used in routine molecular biology labs to establish the presence of an SNV in a DNA sequence.
In recent times fluorescence based nucleic acid detection has been widely used for several CRISPRDx platforms, particularly where collateral cleavage of reporters has been employed. Although FELUDA results can be precisely determined by agarose or capillary electrophoresis, we envisioned fluorescence or chemiluminescence as alternate end-point readouts to expand the scope of devices that can suit FELUDA based detection. To implement this, we first investigated if FELUDA can be adapted to a non-cleavage, affinity-based method of detection which works with single nucleotide mismatch sensitivity.
To develop such a readout, we tested FELUDA with a catalytically dead FnCas9 (dFnCas9) tagged with a fluorophore (GFP) and investigated if its mismatch discrimination is regulated at the level of DNA binding (Supplementary Figure 1A) .
We performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays to measure the binding affinity of inactive FnCas9-GFP RNP complex with WT or SCA substrates. We observed that the SCA substrate showed moderately strong binding (K d = 187.2 ± 3.4 nM) whereas the WT substrate exhibited very weak binding (K d = 1037.4 nM ± 93.3 nM) consistent with the absence of cleavage on the IVC readout ( Figure 2A) .
We then developed a pipeline to adapt FELUDA for an affinity-based fluorescent read-out system, where the amplification step generates biotinylated products which can then be immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads. Upon incubation with fluorescent components in FELUDA, the absence or presence of a mismatch guides the binding of FnCas9 molecules to the substrate leading to loss of fluorescence signal in the supernatant ( Figure 2B ). We tested FELUDA using WT or SCA substrates and observed distinct signatures that distinguished between the two alleles suggesting that FELUDA can be adapted for a fluorescence-based readout ( Figure 2B ).
Next, we investigated if FELUDA detection can be extended to a quick point of care diagnosis of SNVs using lateral flow strips for instrument-free visual detection.
Although such read-outs have been demonstrated with CRISPR effectors that have collateral activity, they rely on a secondary signal amplification step where fluorescent oligos are added to the reaction setup. We designed an assay using FAM labelled RNP complex and biotin labelled amplicons on commercially available paper strips. In such a reaction, RNP-bound substrate molecules in a solution can lead to aggregation of the complex on a distinct test line of the strip while anti-FAM antibody linked gold nanoparticles accumulate on a control line on the strip ( Figure   2C ). To enable FAM labelling of sgRNA, we first validated the successful activity of chimeric FnCas9 sgRNAs by altering the length of overlap between crRNA:tracrRNA and observed that 19nt overlap can efficiently cleave the target ( Figure 2D ). Since a single FAM labelled tracrRNA is compatible with multiple crRNAs, this design also reduces the time and cost of a FELUDA assay. Next, we performed this assay with the HBB target and were able to detect up to femtomolar levels of target DNA in a solution suggesting that even without signal amplification, FELUDA reaches sensitivity similar to that reported for CRISPRDx platforms employing collateral activity ( Figure 2E ). Finally, we tested FELUDA using WT and SCA samples and obtained clear distinguishing bands for either condition validating the feasibility of visual detection for FELUDA diagnostics with complete accuracy ( Figure 2F ).
Genotyping carrier individuals with heterozygosity though non-sequencing PCR based methods is often complicated and requires extensive optimization of primer concentration and assay conditions. Although sickle cell trait (SCT) individuals are generally non-symptomatic, carrier screening is vital to prevent the spread of SCA in successive generations and is widely employed in SCA control programs in various parts of the world 19 . We speculated that the high specificity of FELUDA can be . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We also investigated the use of saliva instead of blood as a non-invasive source of genomic DNA that would allow genotyping children and aged subjects where drawing blood may not be feasible. We obtained a clear, distinguishable signature of DNA cleavage in an SCT subject that was intermediate between normal or SCA individuals suggesting that FELUDA can be successfully used for determining zygosity at a specific SNV ( Figure 3A ). Although this reinforced the inherent sensitivity of FELUDA for genotyping targets with 1bp mismatches, obtaining the three distinct readouts would necessitate significantly robust reaction components and high reproducibility across multiple subjects. We performed a blinded experiment using DNA obtained from 49 subjects with all three genotypes from a Tertiary care center. Remarkably, the FELUDA results perfectly matched with the sequencing data from the same samples performed in a different laboratory (CSIR Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Chandak Lab) and thus identified all three genotypes with 100% accuracy ( Figure 3B ).
Although several pathogenic SNVs are located close to a NGG PAM and can be accurately targeted by FELUDA, these form only a small subset of the total number of disease-causing SNVs catalogued in ClinVar database (Supplementary Figure   4 ) 25 . To detect the non-PAM proximal SNVs we designed an in-built PAM site in the amplification step of FELUDA. We tested this approach using 2 SNVs (A2142G and A2143G) present in Helicobacter pylori 23s rRNA gene and which do not have a NGG PAM in the vicinity. These SNVS confer variable clarithromycin resistance in patients with gastric ulcers and clinically pose a serious concern for physicians 26 . We validated that PAM-mer based amplification can be successfully used for FnCas9 based IVC by targeting synthetic DNA sequence containing the H. pylori 23s rRNA gene ( Figure 3C ). We then isolated bacteria DNA from patient gut biopsy samples FELUDA reaction. To overcome this, we explored single mismatches in the sgRNA sequence that might lead to abrogation of cleavage or binding from the substrate particularly at positions 16-19 at PAM distal end, since these showed minimum cleavage from our previous study. Remarkably, we found that FnCas9 shows negligible cleavage at each of these positions (Supplementary Figure 5A ). In particular, mismatch at PAM distal 16 th base shows complete absence of cleavage and negligible binding affinity to mismatched substrate ( Figure 3D ). To confirm this strategy, we targeted the SNV rs713598 which is associated with either G or C or G/C (heterozygous) variants in different individuals 28 The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.028167 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Supplementary Figure 10B ). Its ease of design and implementation, as exemplified by its urgent deployment during the COVID-19 health crisis offers immense possibilities for rapid and wide-spread testing that has so far proven to be successful in spreading the progression of the disease in multiple countries.
