Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming an increasing global health issue which has spread across the globe. We aimed to study the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of adult inpatients with COVID-19.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , an emerging infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [ We performed a retrospective cohort study on the effect of corticosteroid in a group of patients (age≥18years) with COVID-19, aimed to provide a scientific and rational medical decision-making basis for clinicians.

Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older infected with SARS-CoV-2, which was diagnosed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens[6].
All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed and classified according to the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 7) developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China[7] . In this study, patients with mild or moderate symptoms were classified as noncritical, and patients with severe or critical symptoms were classified as critical.
All patients were treated in the SARS-CoV-2 infection isolation wards. Their oxygen saturation and vital signs were closely monitored. Chest CT scans, laboratory indicators including serial haematological ,biochemical tests, coagulation parameters and inflammation-related factors were performed.
All patients were empirically treated with intravenous moxifloxacin at 0.4g per day for atypical and typical pneumonia, arbidol was given at a dose of 0.2g every 8 h , together with intravenous ribavirin at 0.5g every 12h as antiviral therapy.
Corticosteroid therapy was commenced at the discretion of the attending clinicians after informed consent had been obtained from the patients themselves or their next of kin. The options for the corticosteroid regimen were: pulse intravenous .

Other treatment options included immunoglobulin, interferon-alpha, traditional chinese medicine or any combination of the above.
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an adverse outcome, which was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
115 consecutive adult patients fulfilling the criteria of COVID-19 were studied.
Their demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, comorbidity, clinical features, chest imaging results, laboratory indicators, corticosteroid treatment options and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. The data collection forms were reviewed independently by two experienced physicians.
Categorical variables were given as frequency rates and percentages; continuous variables were defined using mean, median, and interquartile range ( 13] , high lactate dehydrogenase levels [13, 14] , high C-reactive protein levels[9], low lymphocyte count levels [14] [15] [16] [17] ， low serum potassium [18] and .

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A 2-tailed P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Table 1) .
Twenty-nine (25.2%) of our patients reached the adverse outcomes of ICU admission or mortality. Patients with adverse outcomes were older and had more .

When patients were categorized according to whether corticosteroid treatment was given, and compared in terms of outcomes, as well as age comorbidities and other established adverse prognostic factors[8-10, 12-16, 18], the corticosteroid group was found to had more comorbidities, lower lymphocyte count and higher LDH. The age, sex, serum potassium, albumin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein l e vel were similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%), and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013) ( Table 3) .
Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for the confounding effect of disease severity. Patients who were treated with corticosteroid were found to have a 2.155-fold increased risk of either ICU admission or mortality, although not statistically significant (Table 4 ).
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury are partly induced by host immune responses [4] . Corticosteroids could suppress inflammation, but the pathogen clearance and immune response are also inhibited at the same time [19] . Systemic inflammation has been associated with adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV infection [20] and inflammation also persists after viral clearance [21] . In theory, corticosteroid administration can be applied to suppress lung inflammation.
However, in a meta-analysis[3] of corticosteroid use in SARS patients, only four studies provided conclusive data and indicated harm including psychosis[22], .

In our series, This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small. The results could have been biased by some unknown confounding factors. Second, we did not stratify the outcomes according to various corticosteroid dosages, methods and lasting periods.
