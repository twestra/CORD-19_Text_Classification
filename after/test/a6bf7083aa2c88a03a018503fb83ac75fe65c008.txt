Respiratory failure is the leading cause of COVID-19 death and disproportionately 59 impacts adults more than children. Here, we present a large-scale snATAC-seq dataset 60 (90,980 nuclei) of the human lung, generated in parallel with snRNA-seq (46,500 nuclei), 61 from healthy donors of ~30 weeks, ~3 years and ~30 years of age. Focusing on genes 62 implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of 63 alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young 64 lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2 65 exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding 66 sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks 67 with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and 68 TMPRSS2 expression. Our findings reveal a plausible contributor to why children are 69 more resistant to COVID-19 and provide an epigenomic basis for transferring this 70 resistance to older populations. 71 72 73 74
snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data. This combination allowed us to associate cell type-140 specific accessible chromatin profiles that may act as cis-regulatory regions that control 141 cell-type specific gene expression. Using these data, we first addressed cell-type 142 specificity and temporal dynamics of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, BSG, and FURIN 143 expression. We next identified candidate cis-regulatory elements co-accessible with the 144 promoters of these genes and characterized their cell-type specificity and temporal 145 dynamics. Finally, we profiled sequence variation that may impact cis-regulatory element 146 activity and contribute to differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 147
Emerging epidemiology data, including on US cases reported by the CDC, 148
demonstrate that many fewer children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 149 those who tested positive generally show less severe symptoms than adults or elderly 150 individuals (Bi et al., 2020; CDC, 2020) . This age divide coincides with the finding that 151 normal lung development in humans continues until the early 20s (Narayanan et al., 152 2012) . Therefore COVID-19 preferentially impacts fully mature lungs relative to 153 developing lungs. Widespread speculation has attempted to explain these age-154 associated differences, including immune senescence in the aging population. Defining 155 the mechanism underlying the apparent resistance of children to COVID-19 will inform 156 how we can transfer this resistance to adult and elderly populations. To profile cell type specific gene expression and accessible chromatin dynamics in 163 the human lung, we performed single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single nucleus 164 ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) of non-diseased human lung tissue from donors of three age 165 groups: ~30 week old gestational age (GA, prematurely born, 30wk GA ), ~3 year old (3yo), 166
and ~30 year old (30yo) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Three lungs were sampled for each 167 age group, with both males and females represented (Supplementary Table 1 ). Of the 9 168 donors, 5 were Caucasian, 1 was African American and 3 were of unknown ancestry. For 169 all samples, flash frozen biopsies from equivalent small airway regions of the lung were 170 used. Nuclei were isolated from individual biopsies and split into two pools, one for 171 snRNA-seq and one for snATAC-seq. For snATAC-seq, we generated technical 172 replicates for one of the 3yo donors (D032) and an additional dataset for a lung sample 173 from a 4-month-old donor (Supplementary Table 1) . 174
To generate snRNA-seq libraries, we used the droplet-based Chromium Single Cell 175 3' solution (10x Genomics) (Zheng et al., 2017) . The datasets showed a clear separation 176 of nuclei from background in the knee plot ( Figure S1A ). The average number of nuclei 177 that passed initial quality control filtering per sample was 6,676 for 30wk GA , 7,379 for 3yo, 178 and 4,217 for 30yo ( Figure S1B ). Since we profiled nuclei with a high fraction of nascent, 179 unspliced RNA molecules, sequencing reads were mapped to an exon+intron reference. 180
We detected on average 1,662 gene/nuclei for 30wk GA , 1,394 for 3yo and 1,260 for 30yo 181 ( Figure S1C ). Libraries were sequenced to comparable saturation (58.4 % for 30wk GA , 182 51.6 % for 3yo and 55.0 % for 30yo; Fig. S1D ). 183 each dataset, nuclei with >1,000 uniquely mapped sequencing reads were included in the 186 analysis (Fig. S1E) . The average number of nuclei that passed this threshold per age 187 group was 8,691 for 30wk GA , 7,877 for 3yo and 8,034 for 30yo (Fig. S1F ). The average 188 number of reads per nucleus was 6,399 for 30wk GA , 7,199 for 3yo and 8,362 for 30yo 189 (Fig. S1G ). The fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) on average per data set was 52.8 % for 190 30wk GA , 54.4 % for 3yo and 45.6 % for 30yo (Fig. S1H) . These values indicate 191 consistently high signal to noise ratios for all libraries. an unclassified cluster, and enucleated erythrocytes because the latter were only 204 detected in a single neonatal sample, consistent with immaturity ( Figure 1A) . 205
Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes, we found that ACE2 transcript was 206 detected in very few nuclei (total 80 nuclei) in the normal lung and these nuclei were Table 2) . We also detected significant 214 correlation between the fraction of ACE2 + and TMPRSS2 + AT2 nuclei ( Figure S2E ) and 215 found 21 of the 39 ACE + AT2 cells also expressed TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Table 2 ). 216
The other three candidate genes of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry CTSL, BSG and FURIN 217
were expressed in a large number of AT1, AT2, matrix fibroblast, and M1 macrophage 218 cells, as well as a small number of additional cell types ( Figure S2B -D, Supplementary 219 Table 2 ). These findings suggest that among cells that constitute the barrier exposed to 220 inhaled pathogens, cell types in both the airway and alveolar epithelium express genes 221 critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. 222
We next asked if there were genes enriched in ACE2 + AT2 cells as compared to ACE2 -223 AT2 cells to identify potentially co-expressed genes. Among genes that showed a trend 224 for higher expression in ACE2 + compared to ACE2cells was IFNGR1 (log2 (fold change) 225 = 0.4, -log10(p-value)=5.0; FDR corrected p=0.257, Supplementary Table 3) , raising the 226 possibility that ACE2 may be co-regulated with interferon pathway genes, in line with 227 conclusions of a recent study (Ziegler, 2020) . In our data generated from normal lungs 228 this correlation was modest, suggesting there is low baseline co-expression of ACE2 and 229 IFNGR1. Among genes with increased expression in TMPRSS2 + versus TMPRSS2 -AT2 230 cells was ICAM1 (log2 (fold change)=0.27, -log10(FDR corrected p)=12.2, Supplementary 231 Table 3 ), which encodes a receptor for Rhinovirus (Zhou et al., 2017) . The potential co-232 expression of TMPRSS2 and ICAM1 may contribute to the often-observed co-infection 233 by more than one respiratory virus. Indeed, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses 234 including Rhinovirus has been observed, promoting urgent calls to halt the clinical 235 The leading cause of death for COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 251 (ARDS) which is characterized by failure of gas-exchange due to destruction of the 252 alveolar region of the lung (Du et al., 2020) . AT2 is an abundant epithelial cell type in the 253 alveolar region and expresses all of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes assayed here and 254 likely bears the brunt of infection. Consequently, we focused on AT2 cells for follow up 255 analysis. We found that the percentage of AT2 cells expressing ACE2 had an increasing 256 trend in 30yo adult samples compared to 3yo samples ( Figure 1D ). In addition, we found 257 a strong trend of increase in the percentage of AT2 cells expressing TMPRSS2 in adult 258 samples compared to 3yo samples (41.2 ± 6.6% for 3yo and 57.4 ± 7.7% for 30yo, p = 259 0.05 (t-test), Figure 1E ). While very few ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + double positive AT2 nuclei 260 were detected, the fraction of these nuclei in all AT2s increased with age (0.2 % (6 nuclei) 261 in 30wk GA , 0.3% (5 nuclei) in 3yo and 0.5% (10 nuclei) in 30yo, Supplementary Table 2) . 262
Of note, one of the samples in the 30wk GA cohort D062 appeared to be an outlier in its 263 expression of multiple analyzed genes. A review of pathology notes revealed mild 264 features of respiratory distress syndrome including epithelial autolysis and increased 265 alveolar macrophages in this sample, suggesting potential reasons for the variation. In a 266 supplementary analysis, excluding this sample resulted in stronger age-associated 267 effects ( Figure S2F , G). For example, there was a significant increase in the fraction of 268 TMPRSS2 + AT2 cells between 30wk GA and 30yo samples ( Figure S2G ). 269
The increase in proportion of AT2 cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is unlikely 270 due to differences in genes captured per nucleus as the adult samples had the lowest 271 numbers of genes/nucleus, suggesting that the extent of expression increase is likely a 272 conservative estimation ( Figure S1C ). In contrast to the percentage of AT2 nuclei 273 expressing these genes, the expression levels per nucleus were not different across 274 different age groups for either ACE2 (no nucleus had >1 UMI detected) or TMPRSS2 275 ( Figure 1F ). Together, an increased proportion of host cells expressed TMPRSS2 and 276 ACE2 in adults, the latter just a trend due to the sparsity of ACE2 + cells, suggesting that 277 a higher percentage of cells in the adult lung can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. 278
Since a large proportion of COVID-19 patients are elderly, we sought to compare viral 279 entry gene expression in aged lungs to expression in our samples. The LungMap Human 280
Tissue Core, which provided the frozen biopsies for this study, does not have donors 281 older than ~30. We therefore instead, identified 4 publicly available scRNA-seq datasets 282 from non-diseased lungs of ages >55 that served as controls in pulmonary fibrosis studies 283 Figure S4A ). Compared to 30yo samples, we observed a trend for 287 increased frequency of ACE2 + (p = 0.095) and TMPRSS2 + (p = 0.070) AT2 cells in 288 the >55yo group (Aged; Figure S4B ). While these patterns are consistent with 289 epidemiological findings that elderly are at highest risk, we make these observations 290 cautiously due to the multiple potential confounding variables present when comparing 291 across independent datasets spanning multiple methodologies. 292 293 .

To investigate cis-regulatory elements driving cell-type specific and age-related 296 patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene expression, we examined snATAC-seq data 297 generated from the same nuclei preparations. After batch correction and filtering of low-298 quality nuclei and likely doublets, we clustered and analyzed a total of 90,980 single 299 nucleus accessible chromatin profiles. We identified 19 clusters representing epithelial 300 (AT2, AT2, club, ciliated, basal and neuroendocrine), mesenchymal (myofibroblast, 301 pericyte, matrix fibroblast 1 and matrix fibroblast 2), endothelial (arterial, lymphatic, and 302 2 clusters of capillaries), and hematopoietic cell types (macrophage, B-cell, T-cell, NK cell 303 and enucleated erythrocyte) ( Figure 2A ). Supporting these cluster annotations, we 304 observed cell type-specific patterns of chromatin accessibility at known marker genes for 305 each cell type ( Figure S5A ). 306
Focusing on SARS-Cov-2 viral entry genes, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily 307 accessible throughout their gene body in alveolar cells such as AT1, AT2, and airway 308 cells such as club, ciliated, and basal cells ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, the CTSL gene body 309 exhibited chromatin accessibility across epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, endothelial, 310 and macrophages. BSG and FURIN also showed broad chromatin accessibility patterns 311 with the highest activity in endothelial cells, such as capillaries ( Figure 2B ). Overall, the 312 patterns of chromatin accessibility across cell types at genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 313 cell entry substantiate our conclusions from snRNA-seq data, including the finding that 314 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in alveolar and airway cells ( Figure 1B,C) . 315
To identify specific cis-regulatory elements that might control cell type-restricted 316 expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes in the lung, we aggregated cells within 317 each cell type and called accessible chromatin sites from the aggregated profiles using 318 MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008) . We then identified sites mapping within 650kb of each 319 SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene, and further identified sites that were co-accessible with the 320 gene promoter using Cicero (Pliner et al., 2018) . At the ACE2 locus, we identified 165 321 accessible chromatin sites mapping within the ±650kb window ( Figure 2C , 322
Supplementary Table 4 ). Of these 165 sites, only two were co-accessible with the ACE2 323 promoter ( Figure 2C , Supplementary Table 5). We speculate that the low number of co-324 .

When 325 examining the accessibility of the 165 peaks at the ACE2 locus across cell types, we 326 observed clear sub-groupings of sites, including those specific to basal cells, specific to 327 ciliated cells, and shared across basal, ciliated, AT1, AT2, and club cells ( Figure 2C , 328
Supplementary Table 5) . 329
At the TMPRSS2 locus, we identified 289 accessible chromatin sites mapping in the 330 ±650kb window, of which 37 were co-accessible with the TMPRSS2 promoter ( Figure 2D , CoV-2 host genes will be critically important for follow up studies to determine how host 346 cell genes are regulated and how genetic variation within these elements contributes to 347 infection rate and disease outcomes. 348 349 Cis-regulatory elements linked to TPMRSS2 are part of an age-related regulatory 350 program associated with immune signaling in AT2 cells 351
Having observed increasing percentages of TMPRSS2 expressing cells with age in 352 AT2 cells ( Figure 1E , Figure S2G ), we speculated that TMPRSS2 may be under the 353 control of an age-related cis regulatory program. To investigate whether an age-354 associated cis-regulatory network exists in AT2 cells, we identified accessible chromatin 355 sites in AT2 cells that show dynamic accessibility across donor age groups. Based on our 356 findings from snRNA-seq we speculate that these dynamics will be at least in part due to 357 a higher number of cells expressing these genes rather than more activity within a cell. 358
We tested all possible pairwise age comparisons between AT2 signal from each of the 359 three groups of 30wk GA , 3yo, and 30yo donors while accounting for donor to donor 360 variability ( Figure 3A ). Overall, we identified 22,745 age-linked sites in AT2 cells which 361 exhibited significant differences (FDR<0.05) in any pairwise comparison ( Figure 3A, B) . 362
Clustering of these dynamic peaks revealed five predominant groups of age-dependent 363 chromatin accessibility patterns (cI-cV, Fig 3B) . 364
We identified two clusters of AT2 sites exhibiting increasing accessibility with age 365 including several sites at candidate genes for SARS-CoV-2 host genes (cIII 30yo enriched 366 and cIV 3yo + 30yo) ( Figure 3B , Figure S6A We focused on the TMPRSS2 locus and determined how many of the 37 accessible 378 chromatin sites co-accessible with the TMPRSS2 promoter (in Figure 2D ) showed 379 increased accessibility with age in AT2 cells. We identified 13 sites with age-increased 380 accessibility, of which 10 had significant effects (FDR < 0.05 via EdgeR and/or p < 0.05 381 via t-test) ( Figure 3E , F, Figure S6 , Supplementary CEBPA, and inflammation-related factors such as STAT, IRF, and FOS/JUN ( Figure 3G ) 384 many of which were corroborated by available ChIP-seq data in lung related samples (Oki 385 et al., 2018) . Furthermore, at 12 of the 13 age-increasing sites, we uncovered additional 386 evidence for enhancer-related histone modifications from ENCODE supporting that they 387 have cis-regulatory activity ( Figure 3H ) (Consortium, 2012) . When viewed in genomic 388 context these sites showed a clear age-dependent increase in read depth likely reflecting 389 a higher fraction of accessible nuclei ( Figure 3I ). 390 391 Genetic variants predicted to affect age-increased TMPRSS2 sites are associated 392 with respiratory phenotypes and TMPRSS2 expression 393
Mapping the discrete accessible chromatin sites at genes required for SARS-CoV-2 394 viral entry allowed us to next characterize non-coding sequence variation that might affect 395 regulation of these sites and contribute to phenotypic differences in the risk of lung 396 disease. In particular, we focused on the 37 sites linked to TMPRSS2 activity including 397 13 with age-increased chromatin accessibility. Figure 4A ). Among these 148 variants, 14 were common (defined here as 406 minor allele frequency > 1%) in at least one major population group in gnomAD, several 407 of which were predicted to disrupt AT2 age-dynamic TF motifs such as FOS/JUN, IRF, 408 STAT, RUNX, NKX and ESR1 ( Figure 4A ). The common variants generally had 409 consistent frequencies across populations, except for rs35074065 which was much less 410 common in East Asians (EAS) relative to other populations (MAF=0.005, Figure 4B ). 411
We next determined whether common variants with predicted AT2 regulatory effects 412
were associated with phenotypes related to respiratory function, infection, medication use 413 or other traits using GWAS data generated using the UK Biobank (UKBB) (Sudlow et al., 414 2015) . Across the 11 variants tested for association in UKBB data, the most significant 415 association was between rs35074065 and emphysema (p=5.64×10 -7 ) ( Figure 4C ). This 416 variant was also more nominally associated (p<0.005) with asthma (p=6.7×10 -4 ) and 417 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.037580 doi: bioRxiv preprint influenza vaccine (p=1.76×10 -3 ). Furthermore, the majority of tested variants (8/11) were 418 nominally associated (p<1x0 -3 ) with at least one phenotype related to respiratory function 419 or respiratory medication use including salmeterol + fluticasone propionate, which is 420 commonly used to treat asthma and COPD (rs7279188 p=1.3×10 -5 ), bacterial pneumonia 421 (rs2838089 p=2.4×10 -4 ), bronchiectasis (rs9974995 p=7.1×10 -4 , rs568517 p=8.1×10 -4 ), 422
and COPD (rs1557372 p=2.9×10 -3 ) ( Figure 4C ). 423
Given that common AT2 variants showed predicted regulatory function and 424 association with respiratory disease and infection phenotypes, we next asked whether 425 these variants regulated the expression of TMPRSS2 using human lung eQTL data from 426 the GTEx v8 release. Among variants tested for association in GTEx, we observed a 427 highly significant eQTL for TMPRSS2 expression at rs35074065 (p=3.9×10 -11 ) as well as 428 more nominal eQTL evidence at rs1557372 (p=2.9×10 -5 ) and rs9974995 (p=3.5×10 -6 ). 429
Furthermore, in fine-mapping data, rs35074065 had a high posterior probability 430 (PPA=41.6%) and therefore likely has a direct casual effect on TMPRSS2 expression 431 ( Figure 4D ). This variant further disrupted sequence motifs for IRF and STAT transcription 432 factors, suggesting that its effects may be mediated through interferon signaling and anti-433 viral programs ( Figure 4D ). 434
As the TMPRSS2 eQTL at rs35074065 was identified in bulk lung samples, we finally 435 sought to determine the specific cell types driving the effects of this eQTL. Using cell type-436 specific expression profiles derived from our snRNA-seq data, we estimated the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.037580 doi: bioRxiv preprint
In this study, we focused on the lung, the organ at the center of COVID-19 morbidity 448 and mortality. We generated a snATAC-seq reference dataset of the healthy human lung 449 at three postnatal stages, and in parallel generated snRNA-seq data from the same 450 samples to allow comparison with gene expression. Importantly, datasets were produced 451 using uniform tissue procurement and single nucleus technologies for both modalities 452 across samples. This consistency allowed us to uncover age-associated dynamics in 453 gene expression and regulation. While we focus on COVID-19 related genes in this study, 454 the datasets more broadly enable in-depth analysis of cell-type resolved dynamics of 455 chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the human lung. We hope these datasets 456 will be further utilized by the community to enhance knowledge and treatment of lung 457
One of the strongest findings that has been corroborated by multiple large-scale 459 epidemiological studies is that infants and children, while still susceptible to infection, 460
generally do not develop symptoms as severe as adults (Bi et al., 2020; CDC, 2020) . 461
Although the underlying molecular basis of this skew is unclear and is likely multifactorial, 462 our data demonstrate that ACE2 + and TMPRSS2 + and ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + are detected 463 in a higher proportion of AT2 nuclei in adult samples compared to the younger samples. 464
These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may enter proportionally fewer cells in younger 465 lungs compared to adult lungs, leading to tempered viral replication and damage. While 466 we await clinical validation of this finding, this difference in viral entry factors, in addition 467 to likely differences in immune response to viral infection, may explain the age-related 468 bias in COVID-19 severity. 469
The observed increase in the proportion of cells expressing viral entry genes is further 470 corroborated by age-related changes in accessible chromatin, which offers insight for 471 using gene regulatory mechanisms to restrict the expression of viral entry genes. For 472 example, at the TMPRSS2 locus we identified 10 accessible chromatin sites that showed 473 significantly increased accessibility with age. These sites may therefore represent cis 474 regulatory elements that contribute to activation of TMPRSS2 gene expression in an 475 increasing number of cells in adults and represent possible sites to modulate in order to 476 restrict expression. Furthermore, one of the age-dependent sites harbors a sequence 477 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

To explore potential avenues for manipulating the expression of viral entry genes, we suggested that viral-induced interferon activation stimulates ACE2 expression (Ziegler, 497 2020) . We caution that the potential effect of interferon signaling on COVID-19 needs to 498 be investigated beyond viral entry, as the pathway likely has distinct roles in the different 499 phases of the disease. 500
In our lung snRNA-seq data, ACE2 is detected in a very small number of cells, a 501 the possibility that ACE2 may not be needed at high levels for viral attachment to host 506 cells. Alternatively, it is plausible that alternative receptors such as BSG also facilitate 507 SARS-CoV-2 attachment in vivo. Compared to ACE2, BSG is expressed and co-508 .

To limit SARS-CoV-2 infection by manipulating the expression of viral entry proteins, 511
we caution that inhibiting ACE2 expression should not be a recommended strategy. Aside 512 from being a viral receptor gene, ACE2 is also required for protecting the lung from injury-513 induced acute respiratory distress phenotypes, the precise cause of COVID-19 mortality 514 In this study, we present the first snATAC-seq dataset of the human lung and 523 complementary snRNA-seq data from the same samples. Here, we used COVID-19 524 genes to demonstrate how this dataset can be utilized. As COVID-19 GWAS data 525 emerge, our datasets will offer a powerful cell type-resolved platform to interrogate 526 mechanisms that may underlie genetic differences in the susceptibility and response to 527 SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that modulation of the interferon 528 pathway is a possible avenue to restrict TMPRSS2 expression and viral entry. 529
Identification of regulators that restrict the expression of viral entry genes without 530 detrimentally affecting other aspects of the normal antiviral response will be a safe and 531 effective strategy towards combating COVID-19. We note that this work is a product of 532 the NHLBI-funded LungMap consortium, and our joint goal is to provide the community 533 with fundamental knowledge of the human lung to help combat COVID-19.

Prior to the final clustering results, we performed iterative clustering to identify and 799 remove cells mapping to clusters with aberrant quality metrics. First, we removed 3,183 800 cells mapping in clusters with low read depth. Next, we removed 20,718 cells mapping in 801 clusters with low fraction of reads in peaks. Finally, we re-clustered the cells at high 802 resolution and removed 5,209 cells mapping in potential doublet sub-clusters. On 803 average, these sub-clusters had higher usable counts, promoter usage, and accessibility 804 at more than one marker gene promoter. After removing all of these cells, our final clusters 805 consisted of 90,980 cells. To identify marker genes for each cluster, we used linear 806 regression models with gene accessibility as a function of cluster assignment and usable 807 counts across single cells. 808
Computing relative accessibility scores 810
We define an accessible locus as the minimal genomic region that can be bound and 811 cut by the enzyme. We use ⊂ to represent the set of all accessible loci. We further 812 define a pseudo-locus as the set of accessible loci that relates to each other in a certain 813 meaningful way (for example, nearby loci, loci from different alleles). In this example, 814 pseudo-loci correspond to peaks. We use { | ⊂ } to represent the set of all pseudo-815 loci. Let be the accessibility of accessible locus , where ∈ . We define the 816 accessibility of pseudo-locus as = ∑ ∈ , i.e., the sum of accessibility of 817 accessible loci associated with di. Let be the library complexity (the number of distinct 818 molecules in the library) of cell . Assuming unbiased PCR amplification, then the 819 probability of being sequenced for any fragment in the library is: = 1 − (1 − ) , where 820 is the total number of reads for cell . If we assume that the probability of a fragment 821 present in the library is proportional to its accessibility and the complexity of the library, 822 then we can deduce that the probability of a given locus in cell being sequenced is: 823
. For any pseudo-locus , the number of reads in for cell follows the 824 Poisson binomial distribution, and its mean is
Given a pseudo-locus (or peak) by cell count matrix , we have: ∑ = ∑ . 826

Calculating the relative percent of cells with accessibility at a locus 831
To correct for biases occurring from differential read depths between clusters, we used 832 the following strategy to determine the relative ratio of cells with accessibility at a given 833 locus. We defined the set of accessible loci L of a given dataset D as the genomic regions 834 covered by the set peaks P inferred from D. We define X the set of cells from D, and a 835 partitioning of X. For a given partition ∈ and for each feature ∈ , we computed 836 the ratio of cells from with at least one read overlapping . We then defined the 837 score of loci in as = 10 . ∑ ∈ . We finally define the relative ratio of cells 838

To identify AT2 co-accessible loci with the promoters of TMPRSS2, ACE2, FURIN, 842 BSG, and CTSL we used Cicero (Pliner et al., 2018) . First, we performed a Cicero 843 analysis for each individual cluster using a genomic window of 1 Mb (co-accessibility 844 score >0.05). In addition, we performed Cicero using a random subset of 15,000 nuclei 845 from the complete dataset and a genomic window of 250 kb (co-accessibility score >0.05). 846
We then defined the promoter regions of ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN, BSG, and CTSL as 847 transcriptional start site (TSS) +/-1 kb and selected the sites co-accessible with each of 848 the promoters (co-accessibility score >0.05). Finally, we merged the elements co-849 accessible with the gene promoters from both analyses to generate a union set of 850 candidate elements.

Sites with False Discovery Rate 857 (FDR) < 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction were considered significant. Next, we 858 performed K-means using the relative accessibility score with a loci x timepoints matrix. 859
We used K from 5 to 8 and computed the Davis-Bouldin index to determine the best K to 860 partition the loci. let = ( ) with the average distance of each sample from cluster 861
x and the distance between the centroids of clusters x and y. The Davies-Bouldin 862 index is defined as = ∑ max ( ) , ∈ and low DB scores indicate better partitioning. 863
We obtained an optimal partition with K=5. used ChIP-atlas (Oki et al., 2018) . We downloaded a BED file for "TFs and other" antigens 889 across all lung related samples from the Peak Browser. We intersected these peaks with 890 the TMPRSS2-linked peaks and the FIMO motifs (Grant et al., 2011) . In addition, we 891 downloaded enhancer related histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) from the 892 SCREEN database and intersected with the peak lists (Consortium, 2012) .

We downloaded UK biobank round 2 GWAS combined sex results (Lab, 2020; Sudlow 918 et al., 2015) . We used broad disease categories from the ICD-10-CM to classify ICD10 919 phenotypes, except for ICD10 codes relating to unclassified symptoms, external causes 920 of morbidity, and factors influencing health status and contact with health services. We 921 combined all non-cancer, self-reported diseases into a single category (self-reported) as 922 well as all treatments and medications (medication). We then extracted GWAS 923 association results for variants that were not tagged as low confidence variants, had 924 r s 3 5 0 7 4 0 6 5 r s 1 1 5 6 6 0 9 9 5 r s 7 2 7 9 1 8 8 r s 8 1 2 7 2 9 0 r s 1 5 5 7 3 7 2 r s 2 8 3 8 0 8 9 r s 9 9 7 4 9 9 5 r s 2 8 3 9 4 6 0 r s 5 6 8 5 1 7 r s 1 1 7 3 6 3 0 1 9 r s 7 3 2 2 1 4 6 7 0 2 4 6 -log 10 (P-value)
