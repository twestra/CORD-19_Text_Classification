Background: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled ambulatory cancer care. As a result, there has been a renewed focus on video consultations as a means to continue ambulatory care.
Objective: To characterize the increase in video visits at the University of California, San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and compare demographics/appointment data from January 1, 2020 and in the 3 weeks after transition to video visits.
were abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database. Video visits were performed using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with a preexisting workflow.
The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled healthcare and, in particular, ambulatory cancer care. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has renewed focus on telehealth 1 , including video consultations 2 , as a means of continuing ambulatory care without increasing the risk of potential exposure for patients, clinicians, and staff.
Program in 2015 and offers video visits in all practices. In response to the evolving pandemic, leadership challenged the organization to transition all in-person clinic visits, beginning March 15, 2020, to video visits with exceptions only for specific, urgent cases.
Here we report initial data on the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth throughout a Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and departments) were abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database. The pre-COVID-19 period was defined as January 1 to March 14, 2020, prior to the transition, and the post-COVID-19 period as the three weeks following the transition.

Across 17 departments and divisions at the Cancer Center, 2,284 video visits were performed in the pre-COVID-19 period (average 208 ± 75 per week) and 3,015 performed in the post-COVID-19 period (average 1,005 ± 149 per week) ( Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). Figure 1 shows the weekly proportion of video, in-person clinic, procedure, and phone visits since January 1, 2020. The proportion of video visits increased from 7-18% to 54-68%, between the pre-and post-COVID-19 periods.
Post COVID-19, first clinic encounter (24.9% vs 18.3%; p <0.001), first video visit (62.2% vs 46.2%; p <0.001), and MD-provided visits (82.9% vs 67.3%; p <0.001) increased without any disparity based on race/ethnicity, primary language, or insurance (Table 1) . Increased post COVID-19 utilization was noted for patients in urban areas (93.2% vs 88.7%; p<0.001).
We demonstrate a rapid expansion (from <20% to 68%) in telehealth use in a Comprehensive Cancer Center over a remarkably brief time period in response to COVID-19 without differences by race or insurance. Medicare telehealth visits have increased by more than 25% annually for the past decade 3 , yet absolute adoption numbers remain low and fragmented with concerns about potentiating disparities in healthcare access 4 .

Here we report our experience in rapidly scaling the utilization of telehealth in response to COVID-19 and maintaining access to complex oncologic care at a time of social distancing. In many health systems, there will undoubtedly be many lessons learned from this "natural experiment", which has the potential to permanently change care delivery patterns. All rights reserved.
