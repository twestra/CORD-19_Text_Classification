Background Patients with pre-existing cirrhosis are considered at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but the clinical course in these patients has not yet been reported. This study aimed to provide a detailed report of the clinical characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.
Methods In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we consecutively included all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis that had been discharged or had died by 24 March 2020 from 16 designated hospitals in China.
Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings on admission, treatment, complications during hospitalization and clinical outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
Findings Twenty-one patients were included consecutively in this study, of whom 16 were cured and 5 died in hospital. Seventeen patients had compensated cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common etiology. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, and direct bilirubin levels were higher in patients who died than those who survived (p= 0·040, 0·032, and 0·006, respectively). Acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary infection were both the most frequently observed complications. Only one patient developed acute on chronic liver failure. Of the 5 non-survivors, all patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2 patients progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
Interpretation Lower lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin level might represent poor prognostic indicators in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global challenge since the December 2019. [1] [2] [3] Concerns have been raised recently about patients with pre-existing cirrhosis, who are known to have compromised immune function and poorer outcomes from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than patients without cirrhosis. [1] [2] [3] However, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the liver, if it modifies the clinical course of cirrhosis, and whether cirrhosis should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes of COVID-19.
In previous studies, the proportion of patients with pre-existing liver conditions (including hepatitis virus infection, abnormal liver function and chronic liver disease) among COVID-19 infected patients ranged from 2·0% to 11·0%. 4-8 More than one half of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have elevated liver function tests and emerging liver function abnormalities after admission were associated with longer hospital stay. 9 So far, no studies have reported the clinical features and risk factors for in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The aim of our multicenter study is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, laboratory and imaging findings, and outcomes among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.

This retrospective multicentre study (COVID-Cirrhosis-CHESS, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04329559) included consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis from 16 designated hospitals in China between 31 December 2019 and 24 March 2020. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay from nasopharyngeal swab specimens; or a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG in serum; or a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG titration of at least 4-fold higher in the recovery stage than in the acute stage. 4, 5, 10 Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on previous liver biopsy results and/or clinical findings, including a history of chronic liver disease as well as documented complications of chronic liver disease (ie, ascites, varices, hepatic encephalopathy) and/or imaging consistent with cirrhosis. 11 Pregnant women and children (age < 18 years) were excluded. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Commission of The First
Hospital of Lanzhou University (No. LDYYLL2020-37). Informed consent was waived, and researchers analyzed only deidentified data.
Demographic data, comorbidities, history of cirrhosis, onset symptoms or signs of COVID-19, laboratory findings and chest CT results on admission were collected.

Twenty-one COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis were identified and all were included in the final analysis. The median age of the 21 patients was 68 years (range: 43-87 years) and 11 of them were male (Table 1) . Most patients had compensated cirrhosis (81·0%)
with Child-Pugh class A, B, and C in 16, 3, and 2 patients, respectively. The median MELD score was 8 (range: 6-23). Twelve patients had chronic hepatitis B, including 3 who also had hepatitis C virus co-infection, alcohol abuse and schistosomiasis, respectively. Comorbidities other than cirrhosis were present in most patients (66·7%), with hypertension (19·0%) and coronary heart disease (19·0%) being the most common comorbidities, followed by type 2 diabetes (14·3%) and malignancy (14·3%). The median interval between onset of the illness and admission was 8 days, ranging from 0 to 30 days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by shortness of breath and sputum production.
There were no significant differences between survivors (n=16) and non-survivors (n=5) on age, sex, comorbidities, etiology of cirrhosis, stage of cirrhosis (compensated versus decompensated), Child-Pugh class, MELD score, interval between onset and admission, or onset symptoms of COVID-19.
Leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 8 (38·3%), 15 (71·4%), and 8 (38·1%) patients, respectively (Table 1) . Hypoproteinemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and prolonged prothrombin time occurred in 11 (52·4%), 8 (38·1%), and 5 (23·8%) patients, respectively. Elevations in aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were present in 8 (38·1%), 5 (23·8%), and 5 (23·8%) All rights reserved.

Nearly all patients had at least one typical sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection on chest CT including ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and bilateral pulmonary infiltration. Figure 1 showed representative chest CT images of COVID-19 and abdominal images of cirrhosis from survivor and non-survivor groups. Patients who died had lower total lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin levels than patients who survived (p= 0·040, 0·032, and 0·006, respectively) ( Table 1) .
Treatment and complications occurring during hospitalization were summarized in Table 2 .
Five patients were transferred to the intensive care unit, including four patients from the non-survivor group (p= 0·004). Use of systemic corticosteroids (p= 0·003), non-invasive ventilation (p= 0·028), invasive mechanical ventilation (p= 0·008), continuous renal replacement therapy (p= 0·048), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p= 0·048) differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors. Overall, 17 patients received antiviral treatment. Among them, arbidol monotherapy, lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon alfa-2b combination therapy, and oseltamivir monotherapy were given to seven, five, and three patients, respectively. Two patients experienced a switch in the antiviral regimen (one from lopinavir-ritonavir plus arbidol combination therapy to interferon alfa-2b monotherapy; one from arbidol monotherapy to lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon alfa-2b combination therapy). Secondary infection and ARDS were both the most frequently observed complication (28·6%), followed by ascites (23·8%). One patient developed ACLF. The frequency of ARDS and gastrointestinal bleeding were higher in non-survivors than survivors (100% vs. 6·3%, p< 0·001, and 60·0% vs. 6·3%, p= 0·028, respectively).

This retrospective multicenter study (COVID-Cirrhosis-CHESS) reports the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, laboratory and imaging findings, and outcomes among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The cause of death in most patients is not due to progressive liver disease but rather pulmonary disease. Lower lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin level were observed in patients who survived compared to those who died.
In our cohort of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis, we found that fever and cough were the most common symptoms on admission; and most of the patients had comorbidities other than cirrhosis. These findings were similar to the previous studies of COVID-19 among general populations. [4] [5] [6] According to the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention's report of 44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, deaths were mainly observed among patients of older age and/or with pre-existing comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. 19 In Italy, besides the above mentioned factors, male patients also had an increased risk of death, as revealed by the report of the first month of documented COVID-19 cases. 20 So far, no studies have been reported risk factors for death in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. Our analysis did not indicate a higher mortality in included patients of older age, male sex or with pre-existing comorbidities. This might be due to the narrow spectrum of our studied population and the limited sample size. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In our study, the frequency of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were both as high as 80·0% in the non-survivor group, 40·0% of whom had decompensated cirrhosis.
Additionally, a lower lymphocyte and platelet counts on admission were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors. These findings were also demonstrated in previous studies in the general population. 23,24 A meta-analysis including 10 studies and 1,994 patients of COVID-19 showed that lymphopenia was the most common laboratory findings, which was consistent with respiratory virus infection. 23 In another meta-analysis, studying the effect of platelet count on prognosis of COVID-19 showed that, comparing patients by survival, a low platelet count was associated with over five-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19. 24 Direct bilirubin was also observed to be higher in non-survivors than survivors in our study, which suggests a potential adverse effect on liver function in this setting. These findings underscore that in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis, a decrease in lymphocytes and platelet counts and increased direct bilirubin should be monitored as they may indicate a poorer prognosis.
We recognize limitations of the current study. First, the sample size is small, which limits analysis of predictive factors for mortality and the generalizability of the results. Further All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 28, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20072611 doi: medRxiv preprint studies with large sample size and prospective design are needed to better describe the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and to determine the risk factors for poor outcomes in this setting. Secondly, the majority of patients in this study had underlying hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis. However, to date there is no evidence to suggest that patients with stable chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of a liver biopsy, we do not know whether SARS-CoV-2 infection had effects on liver histopathology in our study population.
Lastly, the study included only patients from Chinese medical institutions, and whether the data are generalizable to patents in other parts of the world remains unknown.
In conclusion, we have reported the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, laboratory and imaging findings, and outcomes among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. It appears that the cause of death in most patients is not due to progressive liver disease (i.e. development of ACLF), but rather pulmonary disease. At presentation, lower lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin level may be associated with higher risk of death.
