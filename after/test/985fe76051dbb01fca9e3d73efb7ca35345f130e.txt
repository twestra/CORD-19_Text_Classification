Although a large part of the Polish population has heard about coronaviruses for the first time a few weeks ago, in reality they face less dangerous coronaviruses causing simple cold all the time. Only the emergence of a novel strain from Wuhan gave the word "Coronavirus" a new meaning. Before disease introduction, less than a half of surveyed Poles believed that corona virus is the most important topic in the second half of February 2020 (IBRIS [1] ). The disease was not detected in Poland until 03.03.2020, but this topic was relatively important already before introduction and started to drive media and social life after the disease introduction. During opinion poll performed on 09.03.2020 and 10.03.2020, 63% of respondents reported, that this is a serious threat for Poland, 40% that this is a serious threat for their family and 73% that this is a serious threat for the Polish Economy ( [2] ). We observe several small peaks of interest on the Internet for Coronavirus in Poland during investigated period (since January 2020 till 11.03.2020), although the largest surge in interest occurs after the official confirmation of the virus introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020 . The last day of analysis 11.03.2020 was a day of pandemic declaration by WHO.
Recently social media activities are being analyzed worldwide to better understand perception and spread of diseases. This helps in some cases to track the spread of diseases (Ginsberg et al. [3] , Lu et al. [4] , Joshi et al. [5] ) with a higher precision than other methods. The Internet is a good ground for propagation of views often contradicting the current state of medical knowledge [6] . Social media can serve as a valuable source 1. from the end of January and beginning of February when the epidemic was announced and confirmed in China. We see a small peak around 25.01.20 (e.g. death of Liang Wudong) and around 29.01.20 (e.g. first case in Germany); 2. from the end of February till beginning of March (when the number of infections rapidly increased in Italy). We see a clear peak around 27.02.20 (e.g. fake news about possible introduction of the disease to Poland [22] ).
After the first confirmed case in the country we can see a peak on that day (04.03.20) and substantial growth after important measures were implemented by Polish authorities (09-11.03).
People are looking for information on further epidemiological topics related to infection and epidemics as well [ Fig. 2 ]. It should be noted that professional vocabulary such as "hand hygiene" practically does not appear in queries (below the "noise threshold" compared to other epidemiological terms [ Fig. 2] ). Queries related to hand hygiene had a peak in late February and beginning of March. Queries related to masks had their peak of popularity at the end of February and the lack of increase in popularity in March (compared to other epidemiological queries [ Fig. 2 ]) may be due to the success of information campaigns on their alleged low effectiveness or simply due to the lack of the masks on the market. Figure 2 . The intensity of queries with the phrases "quarantine", "protective mask", "hand washing", "hand disinfection" ( "kwarantanna" "maseczka ochronna", "mycie rąk", "dezynfekcja rąk") in Polish Google (01.01-10.03/2020) generated using the Google Trend tool. Disease introduction marked with the blue vertical line. knowledge of basic definitions about the disease in the society. After the first confirmed case, there is a small peak around this day and a slight growth during actual epidemic and massive mitigation strategies.
On 04.03.20, a new page for epidemic spread in Poland was launched.
The intensive discussions between editors in Wikipedia concern, among other, the effectiveness of protective masks or the reliability of data from the PRC (People's Republic of China). No data is available before 10.02.2020, due to changes in the title of the articles together with the name of the virus and disease by WHO.
We choose EventRegistry (EventRegistry [30] ) as a traditional media search engine because it has a large range of online magazines representing various political sites. In addition, it gives priority to the digital versions of other broadcasting channels, including television, radio or newspapers. Between January 31 and March 11, 10755 (before 4603 and 6152 after introduction) representative articles were selected (the non-systematic sampling method was applied).
In the traditional media the weekly seasonality of the articles and 3 peaks of interest: at the end of January, the second half of February and the beginning of March can be cleary seen [ Fig. 5 ]. Counts of news article seem to coindence with all peaks observed at other platforms and expect the peak on 26.02, ahead all of other platforms. All rights reserved.

[33] ) methods to the Twitter data, we build a network with vertices representing Twitter accounts and edges representing retweets (Jarynowski et al. [34] ). The network revealed various connections (social impact, trust, friendship, etc.) between accounts being social actors and the characteristics of the actors (political affiliation, views, etc.). An unsupervised weighted Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. [35] ) for community analysis was used and the vertex color denotes the community it belongs to. Retweet network [ Fig. 7 ] shows how the discourse is divided into the ruling party (gray), opposition (orange) and the protestant religious and political group / "Idz pod prad" (light blue).
In addition, further discourse participants were identified [ Fig. 7 ] as far right (dark blue). The subject of "Coronavirus" in Poland has a conflict-generating potential. As a consequence a dispute has emerged between the ruling party promoting information content and confirming the belief that the Polish state is All rights reserved.

well prepared to fight the virus (gray cluster), and the opposition negating its ability to fight the virus [ Fig. 7 ], especially before disease introduction (Jarynowski et al. [16] ). However after introduction, the most distinguished discourse is represented in the cores of the network [ Fig. 7 ] and boundaries between communities are more blured than it was before confirmation of the first case in Poland ( [16] ). It could mean, that (at least in this weekly resolution) for an average Twitter user, mechanisms of solidarity and community building (for example to help neigbors and support healthworkers) are less politically driven than before.

We also looked on the most frequent words after stemming and excluding stop words [Tab. I]. There are mainly words related to topics around health, but with politicical context as well, due to the political and journalistic bias of Twitter. In comparition to situation before the first confrimed case ( [16] ), there is less politics and less fear related concepts. All rights reserved.

Youtube has a 68% share among Polish Internet users with about 700 million entries per month (PBI [17] ). In addition, streams from the mobile app should be taken into account, as it is most popular app on Poles' smartphones (PBI [17] ). For our analysis, we selected videos on the main subject of "corona 
The fastest growing profile in January and February 2020 in the entire Polish Facebook was "Conflicts and global disasters" ("Konflikty i katastrofyświatowe") which gained over 120 thousand followers in one month correlating with recent increased activity related to corona virus information. The most popular post in the Vlog category in January 2020 was a video material titled "Wuhan market" on SA Wardęga's profile (@sawardega), which was eventually marked as containing false information (Sotrender [39] ).
There are other social platforms not covered by this study such as Instagram (a popular platform among teenagers with affinity index>120 in this age category ([40])). The topic of Coronavius was not so popular at Polish Instagram until the disease introduction. The most popular hashtag after introduction of the virus "odwolajcieszkolyxd" and is related to school closures.
For a better topic coverage blogs (e.g. blog Media@jesion gathers hundreds thousands entries by day ( [41] )) and user comments in Internet media presents additional reach information source.

All measured intensities are positively correlated. Protective mask as a signal of fear/perception of risk is less correlated with other variables more related to information needs.
Protective mask and washing hands is much less correlated than protective mask and hand disinfection, which could mean, that people search for professianal solutions rather thans simple and practical ones.
Moreover, high amounts of searching terms as antiviral mask (there is no such a medical term) implies that people are searching for colloquial terms ( [16] ).
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an unprecedented flood of information (information 'noise') and our task was to extract important events and features from widest range of Internet media in Poland.

Twitter fall (to the great extend) into the information bubble or echo chambers ( [47] ) of supporters of the ruling party [ Fig. 7 ]. Lack of interest in general public ( [43, 48] ) could be associated with a low epidemiological awareness of average Poles, especially when COVID-19 pandemic is massively discussed in traditional and social media by a relatively small but loud group of people.

Under conditions of a market-consumer society, private goals of individuals come into conflict with responsibility of the whole society or community. For example, economic consequence of supply and demand lead to price increases of medical devices ( [49] ).
Due to the data availability, only by analyzing Twitter we have the full control over the methodology and research techniques (Alshaabi et al. [50] ). The most difficult is to access the Facebook data, despite the highest population penetration and the largest reach in Poland ( [51] ). Facebook does not allow automated analysis (Facebook [52] ) for the public and we can only rely on manual work-intensive research of commercial companies (Sotrender [31, 39] ), whose research methodology may differ from scientific standards.
However, there are attempts to use available Facebook Ads campaigns in context to "Coroanavirus" [53] .
In order to prepare and manage the crisis in an optimal way, a deeper perception analysis in the form of reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis is required. Especially, according to the results of empirical research, society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the "state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population" (Taranowicz [54] ). Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like WeChat (Wang et al. [55] , Zhang et al. [56] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [57] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [58] , Paul and Dredze [59] , Salathe et al. [60] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavioral changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [61] , Brockmann et al. [62] , Gonzalez et al. [63] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [64] , Vespignani [65] , Maier and Brockmann [66] , Hufnagel et al. [67] , Ferguson et al. [68] , Prasse et al. [69] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses and properly distribute the available resources. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases (Jarynowski and Belik [70] ).
