During an epidemic, metrics such as R 0 , doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show that early non-pharmaceutical, government actions, were the most important determinant of epidemic dynamics. In particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.
The global COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) outbreak began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (WHO 2020). As of April 12 th , 1,846,679 cases have been reported across 185 countries and regions. There have been several sets of efforts to track the progression of the outbreak across the world and within countries. For example, John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) has compiled data from various sources, including the US Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, to present a global picture of COVID-19 cases and deaths (Dong et al. 2020 ). These efforts have allowed for international scientific research and political decision-making. Although data are collected at local scales (e.g. within hospitals), in an emerging pandemic, data are typically reported at the country level. This allows for interesting comparisons between countries (Anderson et al. 2020 , Jombart et al. 2020 ) and for information from an earlier affected country to be used to slow the outbreak in other places. For instance, South Korea was able to "flatten their outbreak curve" through early and widespread testing as well as strict quarantine policies (Utsunomiya et al. 2020 ). However, country-level analyses still hide more local dynamics that are important to the overall epidemic progression (Chin et al. 2020 , Lin et al. 2020 ).
Spatial heterogeneity is important for population dynamics generally (Levin 1992 , Hanski 2001 , Schreiber 2010 ) and in particular for understanding the progression of infectious disease dynamics (Grenfell et al. 1995 , Park 2012 . Spatial heterogeneity can include differences in local population density, movement patterns, suitability of environmental conditions for transmission, among other factors (Grenfell et al. 1995 , Park 2012 , St-Onge et al. 2020 . For instance, Keeling et al. (2001) showed how spatial distribution and size of farms affected the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth Epidemic.
Here we provide a descriptive analysis of the reported progression of COVID-19 at the state level within the United States. We examine how commonly-used metrics, focusing on doubling time, can vary by state. Clearly, controlled and randomized experiments of COVID-19 spread are not possible (White et al. 2019) . Therefore, although states are not independent units, we can use state-level data to understand the progression of the outbreak across different replicates within a country (Adolph et al. 2020) . We show that across measures of demography, education, health, and wealth, only population density was correlated with doubling time. Further, we show that doubling time was more tightly correlated with state-level governmental actions, including restricting businesses.
We used data compiled by John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Dong et al. 2020) . The United States has seen exponential growth in the number of cases, especially since February 29th (Fig. S1 ). Country-level results, however, hide underlying dynamics within each state (Chin et al. 2020 , Lin et al. 2020 . Therefore, we examined how the number of cases changed over time within each state. To properly compare the progression of the epidemic across states, we looked at the log number of cases since the first day a state reported 25 (after which exponential curves were more reliable) cases (Fig. 1) . On a log scale, a straight line of the cases over time indicates exponential growth where the slope of the line is the exponential growth parameter.
We found considerable differences between states in how the outbreak has progressed (Fig.  1) . These doubling times are, of course, changing over time. We found that doubling times for all states did increase with time and that the heterogeneity between states was reduced ( Fig. 1) . We mapped doubling time across the US and found regional differences where the West and Northeast have seen large doubling times, i.e. slower outbreak dynamics (Fig. S3 ).

Each US state varies considerably across a number of important axes: wealth, access to healthcare, number of international travelers, age distribution, population density, among other factors (Chin et al. 2020 ). In addition, much of the response to COVID-19 has been done at the state, as opposed to federal, government level in the US (Adolph et al. 2020 , Gostin et al. 2020 . We examined three hypotheses to explain the state-level variation in COVID-19 trajectories: human demographics, wealth and education indicators, and governmental interventions.
Given the large heterogeneity between states early on ( Fig. 1) , we examined correlates of doubling time for only the first seven days after a state reached 25 total cases. We found that population density, flu vaccination rates, and wealth were all correlated with doubling times (Table 1 ). This suggests that demography might have been more important early in the outbreak, though testing differences between states may also have been important (Fig.  S4 , Kaashoek & Santillana (2020) ).
We then examined the overall (all days since 25 total cases) doubling times at the state level. Except for population density and percent of population living in rural areas, we found that demography, education, and wealth were poor predictors of the state-level overall doubling times (Fig. 2, Table 1 ). Therefore, we also examined the correlation between doubling time and state government interventions. We used information collected by Adolph et al. (2020) on whether or not a state had implemented a specific action by the first day they had 25 or more cases. We adjusted this number to 150 cases for more severe restrictions like closing all non-essential business or stay at home mandates). We looked at closing of public schools, limiting large gatherings (usually of more than 10 people), restricting business, and stay at home orders (Adolph et al. 2020) . Of these factors, only restricting businesses, specifically restaurants, was a significant predictor of doubling time (Fig. 3, Table 1 ). These restrictions were also additive, as states that implemented more actions early had higher doubling times (Fig. 3) . The ordering of these restrictions was also fairly consistent between states (Fig. 4) . While declaring a state of emergency is an obvious first intervention, closing public schools tend to be implemented at different times across states. More importantly, by the time government restrict businesses and declare a stay-at-home order, all other interventions tend to have already been implemented (Fig. 4, Adolph et al. (2020) ).
Lastly, after accounting for population density, a state's "tightness" score was also correlated with doubling time. A state with a high tightness score has "many strongly enforced rules and little tolerance for deviance" (Harrington & Gelfand 2014) . We expected that states with highly enforced rules should have higher doubling times compared to "loose" states. Instead, we found that opposite where tight states had low doubling times and faster disease spread. We hypothesis this may be the result of people in tight cultures finding it more difficult to adjust their behavior when new rules are imposed. More work has to be done to understand this relationship.

Per state, every intervention is given a rank from 1 to 6 depending on when it was implemented (1 being the first put into place) and ties are given an average rank (e.g. 2.5 for tied 2nd and 3rd rank).
We found a large degree of heterogeneity in the reported number of COVID-19 cases over time across US states. After state-level government actions were implemented, doubling time was most strongly correlated to restrictions on businesses, in particular restaurants. More detailed work will be needed to understand how these dynamics differ within each state, especially as many government actions started on more local scales.
