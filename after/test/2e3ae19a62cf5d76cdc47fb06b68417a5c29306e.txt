20 Coronaviruses (CoVs) emerge as zoonoses and cause severe disease in humans, 21 demonstrated by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. RNA recombination is 22 required during normal CoV replication for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis and 23 . CC-BY
generates defective viral genomes (DVGs) of unknown function. However, the 24 determinants and patterns of CoV recombination are unknown. Here, we show that 25 divergent b-CoVs SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) perform 26 extensive RNA recombination in culture, generating similar patterns of recombination 27 junctions and diverse populations of DVGs and sgmRNAs. We demonstrate that the 28 CoV proofreading nonstructural protein (nsp14) 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) 29
is required for normal CoV recombination and that its genetic inactivation causes 30 significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of recombination in both infected 31 cells and released virions. Thus, nsp14-ExoN is a key determinant of both high fidelity 32
CoV replication and recombination, and thereby represents a highly-conserved and 33 vulnerable target for virus inhibition and attenuation. 34 abundance of MHV sgmRNA2 (Eckerle et al., 2007) and altered human CoV 229E 93 (HCoV-229E) sgmRNA detection during viral recovery (Minskaia et al., 2006) . These 94 studies suggest that nsp14-ExoN RNA proofreading activity of CoVs may play a key 95 role in RNA recombination in addition to known functions in replication fidelity, viral 96 fitness and virulence, resistance to nucleoside analogs, and immune antagonism ( We performed direct RNA Nanopore sequencing on the same RNA used for short-read 185 RNA-seq. For both viruses, three independent sequencing experiments were performed 186 on triplicate samples of 2 µg RNA for each virus. In order to remove prematurely 187 truncated sequences, we bioinformatically filtered for Nanopore reads containing both 188 genomic termini. Capture and sequencing of sgmRNAs and DVGs resulted in high 189 sequencing coverage at both ends of the genome, while the relatively poorer capture of 190 full-length genomes was limited due to their extreme length and resulting in depleted 191 coverage in the middle of the genome (Figure 2A -B). We sequenced 132,493 MERS-192
CoV RNA molecules and 1,725,862 SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules that had 85.6% and 193 82.2% identity to the parental genome, respectively (Table S1 ). We obtained 3 full-194 length direct RNA sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome containing over 29, 850 195 consecutive nucleotides that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table S2 ). In CoV RNA, we detected 451 unique junction-containing full-length molecules (Figure 2A , 197 Table S3 ). SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained distinct 172,191 junction-containing molecules 198 ( Figure 2B , Table S2 ). 199
To define the architectures of detected molecules, we filtered for junctions with at least 201 3 supporting Nanopore reads. In MERS-CoV, we defined 5 distinct species, including 3 202 sgmRNAs (6, 7, and 8) and 2 DVGs ( Figure 2C ). In SARS-CoV-2, there were 1166 203 isoforms with a single junction and 227 containing 2 junctions. Because the TRS 204 sequences and sgmRNA species have not previously been experimentally confirmed in 205 SARS-CoV-2, a Nanopore read was categorized as a predicted sgmRNA transcript if it 206 had a junction between the predicted 5' TRS-L and the predicted structural and 207 .

The 15 most abundant isoforms in SARS-CoV-2 included 7 predicted sgmRNA 209 transcripts and 8 DVGs ( Figure 2D ). We also identified potential alternative transcripts 210 corresponding to a single gene (ORF8) ( Figure 2D ). In summary, direct RNA Nanopore (Table S4) Table S4 ). In virions, MHV-ExoN(-) has significantly increased recombination in nsp3, 278 nsp4, and two positions in nsp12 ( Figure S4B -C, Table S4 ). In addition, MHV-ExoN(-) 279 has significantly increased recombination at one position within the 3' untranslated 280 region (3'-UTR) ( Figure S4E , Table S4 ). Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3 .
