Currently, the global COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) pandemic caused by SARS- 28 CoV-2 from Wuhan is affecting the health (including psychology) and/or socioeconomic 29 life of almost each citizen in the world. Finding vaccines and therapeutics to fight CoV-2 30 is urgent. In addition, it is necessary to continue this great research effort in the next years 31 to elucidate the molecular mechanisms (tropism, cell entry, multiplication and spread, etc) 32 that emerging viruses (now SARS-CoV-2) use to infect humans. This knowledge is an 33 investment for the future to prevent and/or control emergence of dangerous viruses that 34 may be could be more terrible for humanity than SARS-CoV-2. The family of The envelope-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with 42 1273 amino acid residues. Its structure was resolved as a homotrimeric with several 43 domains. S protein is subdivided into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 is formed by two domains, Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) PPxY motif is also present in S protein of bat RaTG13and pangolin GX-P5L (Fig. 1A) .
Moreover, S proteins with PPxY motif are phylogenetically close (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, 100 alignment of S protein sequences of the two pangolins showed only two differences in S1 PPxY motif is important for virulence. Figure 1B 
The hot region in S protein contains also Ser/Thr phosphorylated motifs. Indeed, PPxY 130 motif shares also its Pro25 with an overlapping 19 TTRTQLP 25 that could be phosphorylated .
