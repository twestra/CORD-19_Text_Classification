The goal of this paper is to showcase that the COVID-19 disease pattern is evolving and to study the relationship between mandatory BCG policy and caseload/million or death/per million. We analyze seven recent publications on the impact of BCG vaccinations on the development of COVID19 illness and extend presented findings using the latest data from April 10, 2020. We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID-19-related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID-19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with a country's BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the countries' BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program. Therefore, we show that there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that inclusion of BCG vaccination in national immunization program (NIP) has any impact of COVID 19 infections (cases) or mortality.
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted more than 200 countries and territories with at least more than 2.35 million infections and 160,000 fatalities since the beginning of 2020. 1 Though the disease has attained global spread, its impact in terms of number of infections and deaths per million population across countries has been significantly heterogeneous. While the disease was pre dominantly impacting Asian region around beginning of March 2020, in next six week or so, it has moved to Europe and North American region (Figures 1 and 2 ). The growth rates of infections and deaths per million population has also been significantly heterogeneous across continents (Figures 3 and 4 ).

Within this emerging stream of literature that examines the impact of exogenous factors on COVID-19 spread and outcomes, there has been growing interest in examining the impact of Bacille Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine on country level outcomes (Berg et al. 2020; Shet et al 2020; Hegarty et al 2020; Miller et al 2020) . This has been of particular interest to health policy community because there has been some evidence to show that BCG vaccine has non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long term efficacy against tuberculosis (Fine 1995; Dockrell & Smith 2017) , and therefore, there may also be some positive non-specific immunity related effects for COVID 19 in BCG vaccinated populations. .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 23, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 Given that there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly and its country level patterns are highly dynamic, it is useful in itself to estimate the impact of BCG vaccination on COVID 19 case incidence and mortality with more current data. To our knowledge the most recent study related to our work has used April 01 data (Berg et al 2020) . Moreover, none of the previous studies have either controlled for COVID-19 test intensity or have looked at the impact of test intensity on observed dependent variable of cases per million or deaths per million. This is critical, because the dependent variable of interest, either cases per million or deaths per million are observed or measured conditional on potentially infected individual which is detected only through testing of symptomatic or even non-symptomatic individual.
For example, suppose countries A and B have each 1 million population and, at a particular time, have same 10% population infection rate and 10% mortality rate for those who get infected. If country A conducts 100,000 tests, then detected number of infections or cases will be 10,000 and number of deaths attributed to infection would be 1,000. On the other hand, if number of tests in country B are only 10,000, then in country B number of cases detected will be 1,000 and number of deaths attributed to infection would be 100. It is easy to see that while both countries have same infection and mortality rates, country A will report 10,000 cases and 1000 deaths per million, while country B will report only 1,000 cases per million and 100 deaths per million. Therefore, considering cases per million or deaths per million as a measure of infection rate and its severity across countries assumes that the disease detection rates across countries are comparable. On the other hand, data from various countries suggests otherwise: tests per million population vary from 13 (Afghanistan) to 100,002 (Iceland) across countries as of April 10, 2020 2 . Furthermore, data suggest that those countries which are reporting higher number of cases as well as deaths per million are also often times reporting higher number of tests per million ( Figure 5 ).

The research goal of this paper is to extend the research that empirically seeks evidence to study relationship between BCG vaccination policies of a country (and in turn BCG vaccinated proportion of population) and COVID 19 burden (both in terms of cases and fatalities) at country level. Our work is different from previous studies along four dimensions: (a) while previous studies have used BCG as a categorical variable, we create a variable, BCG Index, which approximates the proportion of population of a country vaccinated against BCG; (b) we introduce additional controls such as HDI score 3 , number of days since one case per million, population density per km 2 , percentage of population above 65 years of age, percentage of population living in urban areas and government transparency score via Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 4 ; (c) we take into consideration number of tests per million and also use cases per test as dependent variable in the analysis; and (d) use the recent data to verify if the relationships found in earlier studies with prior period data still holds.
To evaluate the effect of BCG vaccine inclusion in country's national immunization program (NIP) on the COVID-19 infection and mortality levels, we created multiple regression models. We adjusted for different economic and demographic factors such as GDP per capita, HDI score, percentage of urban population, percentage of population above 65 years of age and other factors such as days since a country reported 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases. We created BCG inclusion variable as a three-tiered categorical variable: countries which have never included BCG vaccine in their NIP, countries which had included the vaccine in the past but do not do so currently, and countries who currently have BCG vaccine included in their NIP. In addition we 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index 4 Government transparency score can be considered as a proxy for reliability of reported COVID 19 data at the country level (Hollyer et al 2014) .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 23, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 also created a continuous variable, BCG Index, which captures the number of years a country has included BCG vaccine in its NIP. This index, in our view, is more robust in capturing the coverage of BCG vaccine within a country's population as compared to a one time snapshot of BCG vaccine inclusion in the NIP for the country.
We evaluated the effect of BCG vaccine on different aspects of infection and mortality within a country. We were especially interested in analyzing how the effect changes when we take testing into account. We observed that there is a considerably high level of heterogeneity across countries when we take into account the total number of tests conducted by them per million population. Furthermore, in order to take into account the incidence of COVID 19 based on testing, we created a dependent variable, case per test, which is created by dividing the total number of cases per million in a country by the number of tests conducted by a country per million population.
Consistent with prior studies, we find that inclusion of BCG vaccine in a country's NIP has a significant impact in lowering the number of cases per million and deaths per million for that country. Though we observe that the estimated coefficients are smaller in value from previous studies (Shet et al 2020), when we use more current data. However, after taking into account testing intensity, we find that the inclusion of BCG vaccine in NIP has no significant impact on either COVID 19 cases per million or death per million. The results are consistent for both categorical BCG vaccine inclusion variable and the BCG Index. We argue that here may be endogenous factors such as testing that affect the relationship shared between the inclusion of BCG vaccine in a country's NIP and the number of COVID-19 attributable cases or mortality within the country.
Prior studies may not have taken testing data into consideration due to non-availability of country level data at one source. Worldometer.info/coronavirus/ has been publishing this data since April 4. This provides an opportunity for researchers to consider this critical information in their analysis.
The landscape of COVID-19 attributable cases and deaths throughout the world is constantly evolving. Given the rapidly evolving nature of this disease, we have to be careful before making assertions on how BCG vaccinations influence the emergence of COVID-19-related cases and deaths. Empirical evidence of any beneficial non-specific immunity against COVID 19 infections due to BCG coverage may give a false sense of innate security and protection against the disease to policy makers, health professionals and citizens. Since all most all the developing countries or least developed contries have mandatory BCG coverage in their NIPs and these are also the very countries that have weak public health infrastructure, any false sense of security has the potential to lure them in lowering their efforts to safeguard against COVID 19, including ramping up testing.
We posit that it may be beneficial to create a longitudinal study that can be used to get more insights of the relationship between the BCG vaccine and COVID-19.

We also propose to release new version of the paper every week based on updated data.
In order to find research articles that investigate the relation between COVID-19 and BCG vaccinations, we first run a search using Google Scholar search engine. We used keywords 'BCG and COVID-19' and restricted the search year to 2020. We found seven non peer-reviewed articles published in late March and early April 2020. Five papers were uploaded onto MedRxiv platform (Berg et al., 2020 , Dayal and Gupta, 2020 , Miller et al., 2020 , Sala and Miyakawa, 2020 and Shet et al., 2020 , one study was posted on ResearchGate (Hegarty et al., 2020) and one study became available directly on SSRN . We present a summary the papers in Table 1 and discuss them below. Comparison of the mean case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high rate of COVID-19 cases. All countries selected for the analysis followed BCG revaccination policies in the past Case fatality rates (CFR)

Below we present most important highlights and findings related to the analyzed literature. Shet et al. (2020) apply simple log-linear regression model to investigate COVID-related mortality and BCG vaccinations. The researchers use the following covariates in their model: GDP per capita, the percentage of population 65 years and above and the relative position of each country on the epidemic timeline. The findings show that countries with BCS vaccinations show lower levels of COVID-19-related mortality. In turn, Berg et al. (2020) , after analyzing data on first 30day COVID-19 country-wise outbreaks, argue that BCG immunizations are associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Similarly, Hegarty et al. (2020) argue that countries that vaccinate their populations against BCG, experience less COVID-19-related cases and lower death rates caused by COVID-19. Miller et al. (2020) propose that differences between countries in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by different levels of BCG policy implementations.
In summary, the extant studies find that there is sufficient empirical evidence to show countries that have BCG coverage in NIPs have significantly lower case and death rates based on available data till April 01, 2020. Further, none of these studies take into account heterogeneity in testing rates across countries.
We used Worldometer to collect national COVID-19 attributable data as of April 10, 2020 which includes 'cases per million' and 'deaths per million' attributes for the top 115 countries reporting highest case events. We used the same source to collect information on COVID-19 testing data at country level. We used the data to derive other variables such as 'cases per test' and 'deaths per case', which represented country-specific data on the number of COVID-19 positive cases per conducted tests and the probability of death for an individual who tested positive for COVID-19. We included data on countries' economic status by collecting country-related Human Development Index (HDI) score and Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score. We derived country population and economic information for 2018 (GDP per capita and income status for respective countries) from the World Bank population data. We controlled for the relative population density of a country by including 'population density per km 2 along with the 'percentage of urban population within total population' score. Similar to prior studies (Shet et al., 2020) we calculated two parameters to align the countries on a more compatible time curve to mitigate bias centered due to differential epidemic time curves experienced by different countries. The two variables are as follows:
1. The number of days since a country has reached 100 cases and 2. The number of days since a country has reached 1 case per million.
We included data on BCG vaccine inclusion in national immunization schedules from the BCG World Atlas. We categorized the countries in three groups: -Group 0: 5 countries which have never included BCG vaccine in their schedule;

We also created a BCG Index variable which represents the total number of years since 1950 during which a country mandated BCG vaccine inclusion in national immunization schedules. For example, India mandated BCG vaccination in NIP in 1948 and continues to have it today, so BCG index for India is 1. Spain introduced BCG coverage in 1965 and discontinued it in 1981, so BCG index for Spain is 16/70.
To evaluate the effect of BCG vaccine on either the total amount of infection (the total number of cases per million) or the mortality rate (deaths per million), we created multiple regression models. We performed the analysis for the following four dependent variables (DVs): 'the total number of cases per million', 'total number of deaths per million', 'the total number of deaths per case' and 'the total number of cases per test'. To evaluate the effect of BCG vaccine on the discussed dependent variables, we ran separate models using continuous BCG Index variable or categorical BCG variables: Group 0, Group1 and Group 2 as described above.
We focused on the analysis of data from 98 countries. We controlled for the effects of the following variables: GDP per capita, HDI score, population density per km2, percentage population of above 65 years of age, government corruption perception index, total percentage of urban population, total number of days since 100 cases and total number of days since 1 case per million as of 10 th April 2020. We excluded countries that lacked the information about their BCG inclusion policies or whose population was less than 1 million. For the countries with a BCG vaccination in place which lacked the information on the start date and end date of the BCG vaccination policy, we approximated the number of years of coverage to be 35 years.
We used R and Python to perform the analysis and we present our results below.
We present the comparison of the mortality (number of deaths per million) among groups of countries with differing levels of inclusion of BCG vaccine in Figure 6 . Group 2 countries reported a significantly lower count of deaths per million than countries belonging to Group 0 and Group 1. As pictured in Figure 6 , we observed similar trends for the total number of cases per 1 million population, number of deaths per case and the number of cases per test conducted.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 23, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 In the regression models we tested the effect of BCG categorical or BCG Index on our dependent variables, controlling for other covariates such as GDP per capita, HDI score, CPI score, population density, percentage of above 65 population, urban population percentage, number of days since 100 cases and number of days since 1 case per million. We included another control variable -'test per million' for three dependent variables. We excluded 'test per million' for the 'cases per test', as the two variables are highly correlated.
To evaluate the effect of categorical BCG values on COVID-19 cases per million population, we observed that countries belonging to Group 2 had on average 916 less cases per million than countries represented by Group 0. Group 1 countries did not have a statistically significant difference in case incidences per million as compared to the countries represented by Group 0. Results for 'deaths per million' were similar, as countries with current BCG on an average have 93 deaths less per million as compared to countries which never had BCG as part of their NIP. For the dependent variable 'deaths per positive case' Group 2 countries had 4 percent less deaths per every positive case than countries belonging to Group 0. No such difference was observed between Group 1 and Group 0.
Adding the testing component, we then used the dependent variable 'cases per test', and observed that there was no effect of BCG inclusion in a countries' national immunization program on the number of COVID-19 cases it reported conditional on tests conducted. Our findings are presented in Table 3 . Table 4 .

Recently published studies have conducted multiple analyses and found that the inclusion of BCG vaccines in a country's NIP to have a significant effect on COVID-19 infection cases and deaths. Although our study shows similar findings, when we do not take into account testing, we find that the coefficient estimates of the BCG-related variables have reduced in value based on the analysis on the latest data from April 10, 2020. We observed high heterogeneity in the amount of testing conducted by various countries which adds an interesting dimension to consider while looking at the relationship between BCG vaccine inclusion in a country's NIP and the rate of COVID-19 infection and mortality.
Compared to the amount of testing conducted by countries, case incidence or mortality variables demonstrated significantly lower level of heterogeneity. As the detection of infection is greatly dependent upon the amount of testing being done, we believe there may be endogenous factors affecting the relationship between the inclusion of BCG vaccine in a country's NIP and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. In the current scenario, testing is the only mechanism through which COVID-19 cases are identified. As such it stands to reason that if a country does not test extensively, it will also report significantly lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Therefore, our dependent 'Cases per test' captures the incidence of disease among those for which measurement has been taken. The robust result of non-significance of BCG inclusion in NIP raises questions on the validity of the assertion that BCG vaccine effects the respective spread of COVID-19 in a population. Hence, we believe the since when testing for COVID measure is included in the analysis, the impact of BCG policy on infection rates vanishes, there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that BCG vaccination policy lowers infection rate at the country level.
