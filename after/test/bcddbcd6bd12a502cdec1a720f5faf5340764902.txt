We are currently facing a frightening increase in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. 22 Aiming at screening for fungal secondary pneumonia, we collected the data of our first 27 23 ICU patients, who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial aspirates. We classified 24 the patients based on the recently published study on invasive aspergillosis in influenza 25 patients (Schauwvlinghe et al., 2018.) and found 33% of our COVID-19 patients with putative 26 invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Observing such a high prevalence in COVID-infected 27 patients was somehow unexpected since the 30% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in 28 influenza patients has been attributed to the action of oseltamivir on anti-Aspergillus 29
immunity. Almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients develop ARDS and are likely to receive 30 high-dose steroids or immunomodulatory therapies to prevent worsening as suggested by 31 reports from China. In the COVID-19 patients with putative invasive aspergillosis, antifungal 32
prophylactic therapy may be questioned to avoid increased lung inflammation that may 33 compromise the outcome. This issue remains to be addressed in future clinical trials. We are 34 strongly convinced that testing deep lung specimens for Aspergillus in severe COVID-19 35 patients should be recommended. 36 .

Paralleling what has been reported in influenza patients, we designed this prospective 49 observational bi-center study to investigate the risk of IPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients, 50 especially since these patients were likely to receive immunomodulatory therapies. The 51 patients were classified using the influenza-associated IPA criteria in the ICU 4 completed 52 with beta-D-glucan measurement and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in BAL. Putative IPA 53 was considered if one of the following conditions was met, i.e. 1-presence of Aspergillus 54 fumigatus in culture; 2-BAL galactomannan index >0.8 AND beta-D-glucan >80 pg/mL; 3-55
Aspergillus fumigatus qPCR with quantification cycle <35 in pulmonary specimens; 7 and/or 56 4-serum beta-D-glucan >80pg/mL AND serum galactomannan index >0.5. Of note, direct 57 examination of respiratory specimens was not performed to avoid operator contamination. 58
Twenty-seven successive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 59 admitted between March 16 th and 28 th to our two ICUs were included (Table 1) Aspergillus to the patient presentation in each illnesses may be different. Here, none of our 88 nine putative IPA patients except one received anti-Aspergillus treatment. In the treated 89 patient, antifungal treatment was adapted to cover both candida and Aspergillus infections. 90
In the IPA group, the three fatalities were not related to aspergillosis but to bacterial septic 91 shock complicated by multiorgan failure. 92
Finally, although oseltamivir-induced inhibition of the host neuraminidase activity has been 93 suggested as a possible molecular mechanism leading to anti-aspergillus protective 94 immunity decrease in influenza patients, the exact reasons for increased vulnerability of the 95 COVID-19 patient to Aspergillus remain to be determined as well as the Aspergillus 96 contribution to COVID-19-reated lung inflammation. 97 98
