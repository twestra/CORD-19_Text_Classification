Background: The world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of vaccine is challenging. Aim: To determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Methods: We conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Results: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4 % of the responders, 670 (20.6 %) were under 30 years of age, 1,502 (46.1 %) between 30-49 years, 803 (24.6 %) between 50-64 years, 271 (8.3%) between 65-80 years, 13 (0.4%) over 80 years of age. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95 % CI 76.2-79 %)
will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being healthcare workers and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9-49.3 %) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.
Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly 75 % and 48 % of the survey responders were likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake.
In 2019, the World Health Organization identified ten threats to global health [2] . Among these threats, vaccine hesitancy, the risk of a global influenza pandemic, and the risk of emergence of high-threat pathogens such as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and/or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome were identified. Since this statement, COVID-19 had emerged. Developing COVID-19 vaccines is a crucial challenge, and several candidates are currently under basic development [3] . Some of them will be tested in Phase I trials in the weeks to come [4] . The time it takes to develop a vaccine is estimated to be 1 or 1.5 years as different steps are necessary during the clinical development of a vaccine [5] .
Recruitment of volunteers in a vaccine clinical trial is a real challenge [6] , and some trials are stopped du to difficulties in recruitment. Vaccine hesitancy may also has an impact on recruitment in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial [7] . After its clinical development, a COVID-19 vaccine will also face the challenge of acceptance by the general population in a post-crisis context. .
The impact of the current pandemic on the intention to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial and on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine is not obvious. This is a particular concern in France, which has been shown to be the leader-country of vaccine hesitancy [8] . The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemics on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
We conducted an anonymous online survey (Lime Survey) from the 26 th of March to the 12 th of March 2020 among adult general population and adult patients. The survey was proposed to individuals via social networks (Facebook, Twitter), shared by e-mail, on the website of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne (France), and in centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and in medical centers. We developed a standardized questionnaire based on a literature review.
The questionnaire addressed: (1) demographical characteristics (age, chronic medical conditions), (2) fears about COVID-19, (3) history of vaccination against pandemic H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza, (4) intention to get vaccinated if a COVID-19 vaccine was available, (5) vaccine hesitancy.

If a participant answered yes to one of these proposals, he or she was considered to be "vaccine hesitant".
The questionnaire included items to be answered on a 5-level Likert scale including a "don't know" option to evaluate intention to participate in a clinical trial and to get vaccinated if a vaccine was available. We combined survey responses into two categories (strongly agree/agree, don't know/disagree/strongly disagree) and ran ordinal regression models to examine demographic and attitudinal factors predictive of respondents' willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. To identify suitable candidate variables for regression models, we first conducted univariate analysis using a chi-squared test. Candidates that were significant at P < 0.1 in univariate analyses were then included in a multivariable regression model. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0.

During the study period, 3,656 people opened the web links for the on-line survey, 3 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Healthcare workers are more prone to participate in a vaccine clinical trial than non-healthcare workers (50.5 % vs 45.4 %, p<0.005). Factors associated with COVID-19 acceptance are displayed in Table 3 .

In this on-line survey, we observed that nearly 77 % of the responders would accept a vaccine against COVID-19 although 35 % of the responders were qualified as "vaccine hesitant". Moreover, 47.6 % of the responders would accept to participate in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. Concerning the intention to get vaccinated, our results are similar to the results of the longitudinal Coconel study conducted by the Observatoire Régional de Santé Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur [10] . Similar to their results, we observed that men were more prone to get vaccinated than women. Women accounted for the vast majority of our study responders, suggesting that in real-life settings, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance could be greater. In addition, older individuals are more prone to get vaccinated in both studies, this is probably due to a greater perceived risk of getting infected and developing a severe disease in older people. In the same vein, healthcare workers were more prone to get vaccinated or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial than the others, it is probably due, in part, to a greater perceived risk to get infected. Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable and accounted for 10 % of the infected people in Italy [11] . On the contrary, expecting a low infection risk is associated with a lower willingness to get vaccinated [12] .
Around the half of the responders will accept to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. In the context of a clinical trial, men were also more prone to participate. Fears about COVID-19 were not associated with willingness to participate in a clinical trial. However, individuals who considered themselves at-risk for COVID-19 infection were more prone to accept to participate in a clinical trial for a vaccine. Out of the context of the pandemics, the feeling to be at-risk for a disease was not the main motivation to participate in a vaccine clinical trial [7] . Moreover, older age was associated (except in the group over 80 years) with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, this observation contrast with a previous study about willingness to participate in a vaccine clinical trial [7] . This observation suggests that in the pandemics context, individuals are more prone to participate in a clinical trial for a vaccine.

The proportion of French People favorable to a COVID-19 vaccine can appear low, but we have to put this in perspective with the fact that the vaccine would be a new vaccine, and that vaccine coverage against 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza was only 11.1 % in France [13] . However, a greater proportion of responders to our survey declared they had been vaccinated against 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, so this observation may suggest that the responders are more pro-vaccine than the general population in France, and more often healthcare workers. We observed a similar prevalence of vaccine hesitancy than in a recent study in France, which identified a prevalence of 40 % [9] . One limitation of our work may be the use of social media to recruit study participants. Social media users who use these medias as health information sources are more prone to get vaccinated against seasonal influenza in the United States of America [14] . Furthermore, a great number of healthcare workers (43.6 % of the responders) answered the survey and we observed that healthcare workers were more prone to get vaccinated or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial independently of the perceived risk to get contaminated. However, vaccine hesitancy also affects healthcare workers [15] [16] [17] . In our study sample, vaccine hesitancy affects 29.3 % of the healthcare workers and 39.9 % of the non-healthcare workers. Our sample is not completely representative of the French general population. In addition, we did not precise in the survey, the type of clinical trials, and intention to participate may change between early and later phases clinical trials [7] .
In conclusion, during the pandemics, around 75 % of the French people would agree to get vaccinated.
Due to the burden of the disease, and the potential natural immunity, it may well be possible that this proportion would be enough to obtain a herd effect [18] . Vaccine hesitancy is the major barrier to implement vaccines campaign even in a context of a pandemic. Around fifty percent will agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, we can hope that vaccine trials would not be stopped because of recruitment difficulties.
