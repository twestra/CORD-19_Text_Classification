The COVID-19 is currently spreading around the world, which has posed significant threats to global health and economy. Convalescent plasma is confirmed effective against the novel corona virus in preliminary studies.
In this paper, we first described the therapeutic schedule, antibody detection method, indications, contraindications of the convalescent plasmas, and reported the operability of the treatment by case study.
In December 2019, pneumonia associated with a novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) caused an outbreak, which has posed significant threats to global health and economy 1 China. To share Chinese experience with the world and to standardize the treatment, we summarized the therapeutic schedule of the convalescent plasmas as follows (Fig.1 ).

The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test is negative.
Defined the titer of novel coronavirus-specific IgG antibody: serum/plasma of antibodies titer higher than 1:160.
Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, HIV antibody, and Treponema pallidum antigen test were all negative.

Congenital IgA deficiency. 
According to the principle of cross-matching of blood, ABO homogenous plasma is preferred.
A slow infusion is required at the first 15 minutes in order to pay attention to the occurrence of adverse reactions of blood transfusion.
Here we show the outcomes of three individual patients with convalescent plasma transfusion (Fig.2) , and the characteristics of the donor/receiver are shown in the supplementary table 2 (The participants gave their written informed consent and approved by the hospital ethics committee). The first patient was treated by convalescent plasma on the 12 th day of admission, the viral nucleic acid test became negative and the critical illness turned to severe.

We can learn from this case that convalescent plasma treatment can quickly turn the viral nucleic acid test negative and significantly reduced symptoms. The second case was a patient whose nucleic acid test was consistently positive with moderate symptoms, after treatment on 27 th day, the viral nucleic acid test turned negative four days later. Therefore, in order to save medical resources and reduce the transmission of infection, it is advisable to use convalescent plasma treatment on patients with long-term (more than 4 weeks) positive nucleic acid test of novel coronavirus. In the third case, the plasma donor was a 51-year-old woman with a history of pregnancy (supplementary table 2 Additionally, viral load after convalescent plasma treatment was significantly lower on days 3, 5, and 7 after intensive care unit admission 8 .
What's more, we found that patients with long-term positive nucleic acid test of novel coronavirus turn negative earlier after convalescent plasma treatment than those without convalescent plasma treatment. Furthermore, asymptomatic patients with hypoimmunity, such as the elderly, children and patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis, AIDS, heart disease, tuberculosis, malignant tumor, etc., preferred to use .
