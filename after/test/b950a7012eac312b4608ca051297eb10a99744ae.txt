Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is usually used as supportive therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively.
Results: A total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG.
One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low.
The existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , first reported in China on December, 2019, is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which are enveloped viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from common cold to severe diseases such as SARS and MERS (2, 3) . The COVID-19 epidemic massively influences the public health and people's daily lives, and the disease was declared a pandemic on 11
March 2020 (4) . All populations are susceptible to infection and there is a research shows children are as likely to be infected as adults (5) . On February 11, 2020, there were 44672 confirmed cases in mainland China, of whom 416 were under the age of 10 years and 549 between the ages of 10 to 19 years (6) . The main symptoms in children are fever and cough, and the disease is on average less severe in children than adults (7) .
However, severe cases have been reported also in children (8) . So far, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19, antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under development (9, 10) .
IVIG is prepared from the plasma of healthy humans and usually used as supportive therapy. Its main component is immunoglobulin (Ig) G, which has dual therapeutic effects of immune-modulation effects and immune substitution (11) . IVIG is one of the alternative treatments for children with agammaglobulinemia, and an effective treatment of Kawasaki disease (12, 13) . IVIG was used to treat SARS patients during the SARS outbreak in 2003 (14, 15) , but there is no convincing evidence of its effectiveness. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Some published guidelines of COVID-19 have indicated that IVIG could be used to treat children with severe or critical disease (17) .
The purpose of this study is to perform a comprehensive rapid review to explore whether it is beneficial to treat children with severe COVID-19 with IVIG and provide supporting evidence support for COVID-19 guidelines. Because of the urgent situation, the review was not registered (18) .
We carried out a comprehensive search in the following electronic databases: the Data, by using the terms "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "Novel coronavirus", "2019-novel coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", "SARS", "MERS", "IVIG", "intravenous immunoglobulin"
and their derivatives. The search covered the time from each database's inception to March 31, 2020 . The search strategies are determined by multiple pre-searches and will be discussed with the clinicians about the appellation of disease and IVIG. We also searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISRCTN Registry, ClinicalTrials, Google Scholar, three preprint services, including medRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/), bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) and SSRN All rights reserved.

The primary outcomes were the risk of death and severity of the disease. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of nosocomial infection, the duration of hospitalization, clinical symptoms, absorption of lung lesions, improvement in abnormal biochemical indicators, and adverse effects. We excluded duplicates, conference abstracts, comments and letters, studies published in languages other than English or Chinese, and studies where we could not access the full text.
After eliminating duplicates by EndNote software and manual check, two reviewers (J Zhang and Y Yang) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of records retrieved All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

After this, the same reviewers screened the full texts and made the final selection. A pilot search was conducted before the full screening of the literature to ensure that each researcher understood the screening criteria and process. Disagreements about selection of studies were resolved by consulting a third party (N Yang). The process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram (19) .
Two reviewers (J Zhang and Y Yang) independently extracted the following data from included trials using a standardized extraction sheet: 1) basic information (year of publication, first author and affiliation, journal, funding, conflict of interest); 2) study details (type of study, sample size, research purpose, research population characteristics, interventions; and 3) outcome data. A pre-test was conducted before formal extraction to ensure that each researcher agreed with the extraction criteria and process.
Disagreements were solved through discussion with a third researcher (N Yang).
Two reviewers (J Zhang and Y Ma) assessed the quality of the included studies independently. We used the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool (Risk of bias) to assess the randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials (20) , the criteria recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) for case series to assess the risk of bias (21) , the Joanna Briggs Institute'(JBI) case report All rights reserved.

For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and its corresponding 95% CI when means and standard deviations (SD) were reported. If sufficient data were available, we considered examined the robustness of meta-analyses in a sensitivity analysis.When effect sizes could not be pooled, we reported the study effectives narratively.
The quality of the body of evidence was graded using the GRADE method (25, 26) . Evidence from randomized trials could be downgraded by the following five factors: risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and publication bias. The quality of evidence for each outcome was graded as high, medium, low, or very low. The results of the grading were presented in "GRADE evidence profile" (27) (28) (29) (30) .
We identified 1519 articles in the initial literature search (Figure 1 ). After removing duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of 1405 records. Thirty-one articles were retrieved for full-text reviewing. Finally, one RCT, four case series and one case report involving a total of 198 patients were included for rapid review (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 17.20064444 doi: medRxiv preprint The studies were published between 2004 and 2020, and all studies were from China ( Table 1 and Table 3 ). We found one case series on IVIG in COVID-19 adults with ARDS, one case report in COVID-19 adults, one randomized controlled trial of 44 adults with severe SARS, which included 25 adults with acute lung injury (ALI) and 19 adults with ARDS), one case series involving children with SARS, and two case series also involving adults with SARS. The outcomes of the studies were the duration of fever, total peripheral blood WBC, time of the lung lesions subsided obviously, adverse effects, WBC counts, platelet counts, serum globulin, the incidence of nosocomial infection, the risk of death, survival probability and the progression of disease cascade. In all studies IVIG was used before or in combination with other drugs and treatment (such as antibiotics, glucocorticoids, antivirals, oxygen therapy). The IVIG dose and duration of use differed across studies.
We found a high risk of bias in random sequencing, allocation concealment and blinding in the only included RCT. All case series had a moderate risk (score 4 to 5 out of 8), one case report meeting 8 of the 8 items of the JBI quality appraisal tool ( Table   1) .
The quality of evidence for all outcomes assessed in the only included RCT was graded low ( Table 2) , primarily due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. As we included four case series, we judged that reporting a 'GRADE evidence profile' would not be meaningful. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low for most outcomes and cannot thus provide a reliable indication of any likely effect across outcomes. All rights reserved.

A case series of 109 adults with COVID-19 reported that most patients used antibiotics and antiviral treatment, and over half of the patients were given glucocorticoid therapy and IVIG. The survival probability of patients with ARDS could not be improved by antiviral, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment. The risk of death was not associated with the use of IVIG in the patients with ARDS (31) .A case report of three adults with COVID-19 reported that a high dose IVIG (25 g/d for 5 days) administered at the appropriate point could successfully block the progression of disease cascade (result of the clinical symptoms, laboratory inspection indicators and chest CT scan), and finally improve the outcome of COVID 19 (32) .
The randomized controlled trial of 44 adults with severe SARS found no significant difference in the risk of death (18.1% vs. 23.8%) or the incidence of nosocomial infection (65.2% vs. 52.4%) between adults treated either with IVIG or with conventional treatment. And there was no significant difference in the incidence of nosocomial infection between ALI (50.0% vs. 38.5%) and ARDS (81.8% vs. 75.0%) patients (36) .
One case series reported the patients with SARS who did not receive steroids for severe hemocytopenia had increased WBC counts and platelet counts after undergoing IVIG (34) .

The included RCT showed the serum globulin increased slightly in the IVIG group, but decreased in the conventional treatment group, the difference was not significant (36) .
One case series included ten children with persistent fever who were given IVIG. The body temperature ranged between 38.4℃ and 40℃ at baseline and the duration of fever was 1 to 4 days after IVIG (33) .
One case series reported that chest radiographs in children who were given IVIG showed more patchy focal asymmetric infiltrative shadows, more rapid time of the lung lesions subsided obviously than in a randomly selected, age-and sex-matched control group of 20 children without IVIG (33) .
One case series reported no adverse effects associated with IVIG , when IVIG was used in the patients who had high fever or other obvious poisoning symptoms, who were in the early stage of the disease, who were treated with glucocorticoids, or whose white blood cell counts below 3.0 ×10 9 /L (35).
We only found limited evidence about the use of IVIG to treat children or adults with severe COVID-19. Since SARS and COVID-19 belong to the same family of viruses, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The results were also inconsistent, and no benefit was found in the only identified randomized controlled trial.

IVIG is prepared from pools of plasma obtained from several thousand healthy blood donors. Unlike convalescent plasma from patients with COVID-19, IVIG does not contain SARS-Cov-2 neutralizing antibody (42, 43) . The review showed that there was no evidence that IVIG has an effect on anti-MERS-CoV, or that IVIG would cause kidney failure or thrombosis in patients with MERS (44) . IVIG could increase the risk of vaccination delay. A study by National Advisory Committee on Immunization and the American Advisory Committee on Immunization showed a delay of five months of varicella vaccine in patients who received IVIG and varicella immune globulin (VZIG) (45) . IVIG may increase the risk of infections transmitted by transfusion (42) . Some adverse effects, such as thrombosis, aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, and renal failure, are mainly associated with the use of high-dose IVIG (46) .
The condition, dose and duration of IVIG were inconsistent between studies, the efficacy, and the associated adverse effects remain unclear. The first severe case of COVID-19 in children in China took IVIG with a dose of 400 mg/kg for a duration of five days (8) . The recommended dosage of IVIG for children with severe COVID-19 was also inconsistent in different guidelines, including 1.0g/kg/d for 2 days, or 400mg/kg/d for 5 days, 0.2g/kg/d for 3~5 days, or 1~2g/kg for 2~3 days (47) (48) (49) .
Therefore, it is particularly important and urgent to study the benefits and disadvantages of IVIG treatment in children with COVID-19. It is promising that a trial addressing efficacy and safety of IVIG therapy in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This is the first systematic review of IVIG treatment for children with COVID-19.
There are several limitations in this systematic review. First, the use of glucocorticoids or a combination of a variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics before IVIG may lead to changes in the microecology of the body, affect the immune regulation function, and thus also affect the effect of IVIG. Second, the total sample size of this study was insufficient to make strong conclusions, and the quality of the methodology was generally low which affect the certainty of the results. Finally, we may have missed some studies as we only included studies published in Chinese and English.
There is no direct evidence for IVIG in children with COVID-19, current evidence is insufficient to assess the effectiveness and safety of IVIG for children with severe COVID-19. Therefore, we cannot suggest use of IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 in children. More clinical studies to address this topic are needed.
