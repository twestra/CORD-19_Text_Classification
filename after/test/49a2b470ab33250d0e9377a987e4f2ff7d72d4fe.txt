The heart is a complex organ, composed of four morphologically and functionally distinct chambers ( Figure 1A ), that perpetually pumps blood throughout our lives. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and is propelled into the low pressure vascular beds of the lungs by the right ventricle. Oxygenated pulmonary blood enters the left atrium and then to the left ventricle, which propels blood across the body at systemic vascular pressures. Right and left chambers are separated by the atrial and interventricular septa and unidirectional flow is established by the atrio-ventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) and ventricular-arterial valves (pulmonary and aortic). The heart contains an intrinsic electrophysiologic system, composed of the sinoatrial node in the right atria where depolarization begins and spreads to the atrioventricular node located at the top of the interventricular septum. This electrical impulse is then rapidly propagated by Purkinje fibers to the apex where contraction begins.
Orchestration of the anatomical and functional complexity of the heart requires highly organized and heterogeneous cell populations that enable continuous contraction and relaxation across different pressures, strains, and biophysical stimuli in each chamber. The importance of these variables is reflected in the differences in wall thickness and mass (left, 116±20g; right 84±14g) of adult ventricular chambers 1 .
Specialized properties of cells that enable adaptation to different biophysical stimuli in each chamber are established early in development. The heart is derived from multipotent progenitor cells residing within two heart fields. Cells of the first heart field primarily populate the left ventricle and second heart field-derived cells populate the right ventricle; both heart fields contribute to atrial cells. The distinct gene regulatory networks operant in these heart fields likely establish and prime the patterns of gene expression observed in adult cardiac cells which are further impacted by the establishment of postnatal circulation 2 .
The cellular composition of the adult human heart, their anatomical specificities, molecular signatures, intercellular networks and spatial relationships between the various cardiac cells remain largely unknown. Single-cell and single-nuclei transcriptomics (scRNA-Seq, snRNA-seq) and multiplex smFISH imaging now enable us to address these issues at unprecedented resolution 3 . These technologies illuminate the coordinated communication of cells within their microenvironments that in the heart enable electromechanical connectivity, biophysical interactions, and autocrine/paracrine signaling required for tissue homeostasis but are perturbed in disease.

Bulk RNA-seq analysis is unable to assign gene expression to defined cell subpopulations, light microscopy fails to define features beyond morphology of cell subpopulations and immunostainings are limited to the analysis of few markers at once. Moreover, the large size of cardiomyocytes (length/width:~100/25µM) limits the unbiased capture of single cells requiring analyses of single nuclei transcriptomics to ensure a comprehensive approach. Here, we present a broad transcriptomic census of multiple regions of the adult human heart. We profiled RNA expression of both single cells and nuclei, capturing them from six distinct cardiac anatomical regions. We also analysed the spatial distribution of selected cell populations using multiplex smFISH imaging with RNAscope probes. Our anatomically defined resolved adult human heart cell census provides a reference framework for studies directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular drivers that enable functional plasticity in response to varying physiological conditions in the normal heart, and will inform the heart's responses to disease.
Overview of the cellular landscape of the adult human heart Samples were obtained from six cardiac regions including the free wall of each chamber (left/right ventricle, left/right atrium), denoted as LV, RV, LA, RA, and from the LV apex (AX) and interventricular septum (SP). To capture the heterogeneity of cardiac cell populations, samples were collected as transmural tissue segments that span the three cardiac layers (epicardium, myocardium and endocardium; Figure 1A ) from 14 normal hearts (seven females, seven males) of North American and British organ donors (ages 40-75 years; Figure 1B and Supplementary Table A1 ). We isolated single cells and single nuclei, as the large sizes of cardiomyocyte (CM) are not captured by the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Fresh tissues were mechanically and enzymatically processed to dissociate single cells, and subsequently cardiac immune cells were enriched from the cell fraction using CD45+ magnetic selection. Single nuclei were isolated from frozen heart tissues and purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting. The transcriptome of single cells and nuclei were profiled using the 10X Genomics Single Cell Gene Expression Solution ( Figure 1A ). After processing, all data from nuclei, cells and CD45+ enriched cells were batch-aligned using a generative deep variational autoencoder 5 , prior to unsupervised clustering. After processing and quality controls, we obtained a total of 45,870 cells, 78,023 CD45+   enriched cells and 363,213 We found differences in the distribution of cell types across donors, even within the same region, and correlations between different cell types at the same site ( Supplementary Table   A3 ). For example, in LV, AX, SP and RV tissues, the proportions of vCM and FB were negatively correlated ( p -value=2.0e-4), while there was a positive correlation among the proportions of PC, SMC, and NC cells ( p -value<1e-4). We suggest that these data reflect random sampling that included vessels with EC, PC, SMC, and concurrently fewer CM.
However, the observed correlation between NC, SMC and PC implies a potential functional organization.
The cell distributions were generally similar in tissues of male and female hearts, but left ventricular regions (AX, SP, LV) from female donors had significantly higher mean percentages of CM (46.7±12%) compared to male donors (33.9±10%; p -value=0.008). This is unexpected given the average smaller heart mass of women and may reflect the small donor pool. If replicated, these data may explain higher cardiac stroke volume in women 6 and lower rates of cardiovascular disease.

In addition, we identified a higher aCM expression of ALDH1A2 (9-fold increased), the catalytic enzyme required for synthesis of retinoic acid, that may reflect aCM derived from the second heart field 9 . aCM also showed higher levels of ROR2 (22-fold increased), which participates in cardiomyocyte differentiation via Wnt-signaling, as well as SYNPR (29-fold increased), a synaptic vesicle membrane protein with functions in TRP-channel mechanosensing by atrial volume receptors 10 , 11 .
In contrast, vCM expressed 79 genes with 3-fold higher expression than aCM ( Supplementary Table B1 ). Genes with significantly enriched expression included 7 .

Although cardiac functions of PRELID2 remain unknown, it is developmentally expressed during mid-gestation 15 . Using smFISH of four markers simultaneously in tissue sections, we confirmed enriched PRELID2 expression in RV ( Figure   2G ). In comparison to other subpopulations, vCM2 had highest expression of MYH6 and CDH13 , a cell surface T-cadherin receptor for the cardioprotective hormone adiponectin and low density lipoproteins, both of which are associated with multiple cardiometabolic traits 16, 17 .
We also identified two subpopulations (vCM3 and vCM4) across all ventricular regions. The transcriptional profile of vCM3 was remarkably similar to a prominent RA subpopulation (aCM3, discussed below), and suggestive that these are derived from the second heart field 18 . These cells had higher levels of transcripts associated with retinoic-acid responsive smooth muscle cell genes, including MYH9 , CNN1 19, 20 , and NEXN . vCM3 also expressed stress-response genes including ANKRD1 21 , FHL1 22 , DUSP27 23 , XIRP1 and XIRP2. The XIRP proteins interact with cardiac ion channel proteins Nav1.5 and Kv1.5 within intercalated 8 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

Indeed, Gene Ontology analyses of vCM4 transcripts identified significant terms of "ATP metabolic process" and "oxidative phosphorylation" ( Supplementary Figure   B1C ). These CM also had high levels of CRYAB encoding a heat shock protein with cytoprotective roles and antioxidant responses by CM 25 . With c oncomitant high expression of genes encoding sarcomere components ( Figure 2E ) and PLN ( Supplementary Table   B3 ) , we deduced that these vCM are outfitted to perform higher workload than other vCM.
Unlike scRNA-Seq analysis that identified prominent RV expression of PLN in embryonic mouse hearts 26 , vCM4 were similar in both ventricles.
A small proportion (~1%) of cells comprised vCM5 and expressed high levels of DLC1 and EBF2 27 . These molecules participate in regulating brown adipocyte differentiation and may be involved in cardiac pacemaker activity. In addition, vCM5 nuclei had higher levels of transcripts also expressed in neural lineages ( SOX5, EBF1, and KCNAB1 ) . Notably, mice with deleted EBF1 have profound hypoplasia of the ventricular conduction system 28 . Further confirmation and investigation of this subpopulation is required, given the small number of cells and shared marker genes with other cell types.
We identified six subpopulations of aCM, indicating considerable heterogeneity ( Figure 2B ) particularly between the right and left chambers. Notably, HAMP , a master regulator of iron homeostasis, was significantly enriched in over 50% of RA CM compared to 3% LA CM ( Supplementary Table B4 ) 29 , consistent with prior studies of RA tissues 8 and confirmed by smFISH ( Figure 2G ). HAMP has unknown roles in cardiac biology, but Hamp-null mice have electron transport chain deficits and lethal cardiomyopathy 30 . The RA enrichment of HAMP may imply energetic differences between right and left aCM.

Table   C2 ). This is in line with in vitro models predicting that while arterial SMC are more contractile, the venous seem more dedifferentiated and potentially proliferative 52 .
EC_art and SMC_art ( Figure 3C, D ) . We also predicted differences between the interconnectivity of arterial (EC_art and SMC_art) versus venous (EC_ven and SMC_basic) and smaller vessels (PC-EC_cap), including specific patterns of Notch -ligand interactions Transdifferentiation of stromal populations has been described but remains controversial in the literature 54 55 56 .

These findings are consistent with different specific functional properties of atrial FB, including stronger profibrotic responses 57 , 58 . As genes expressed in FB0_basic and FB1_atrial were found in all ventricular or atrial FB, respectively, we suggest these define a basal, chamber-specific FB gene program ( Supplementary Figure D1A, Supplementary Table D1 ).

Therefore, we used the pan-immune marker CD45 to enrich for this cell population.
We defined cardiac-resident versus circulating cells by calculating the enrichment in perfused tissue versus non-perfused tissue (i.e. NRP versus non-NRP donors), as well as by mapping markers associated with tissue residence.

The FB3 subpopulation signaled to aCM and vCM in turn, forming a cellular circuitry which may be relevant for healthy cardiac homeostasis. 
The heart is innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system, which reside in ganglionated plexuses on the epicardial surface and contribute to regulation of heart rhythm 67 . Neural cells (NC) innervate the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, from which an activating wave-front propagates throughout myocardial tissue via nerve bundles and Purkinje fibers. We identified 3485 NC from cardiac tissues, predominantly (60%) from left chambers, presumably due to multiple left ventricular sites. All NC expressed transcripts ( NRXN1, NRXN3, KCNMB4 ) typically found in the central nervous and cardiac conduction system including sodium and potassium channels 68 ( Supplementary Table F1 ) .

NC2 was predominantly derived from atrial tissues and expressed GRIA1 , encoding glutamate receptor 1 which has altered expression levels in ischemic heart disease 70 . Additionally, GINS3
is enriched in these cells, which is known to participate in the regulation of cardiac repolarization 71, 72 . NC3 and NC4 subpopulations shared a broadly similar transcriptional profile including LGR5 , a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in Wnt -signaling that promotes CM differentiation 73 and demarcates a subset of CM in the outflow tract 74 ; this region often becomes arrhythmogenic in heart disease 75 . These cells also expressed genes associated with coronary artery disease, PPP2R2B 76 , LSAMP 77 and LPL an endothelial enzyme involved transporting lipoproteins into the heart 78 . Additional smaller subpopulations (NC5-10) shared marker genes with other cell types and required further analyses to define their identities.
We CellPhoneDB.org predicted different interactions among arterial ECs and skeletal or heart muscle cells ( Figure 5A ). While NOTCH interactions were shared by both, EC-PC/SMC interactions in the heart were predicted to involve JAG1/2 NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 JAG1 but not in skeletal muscle. Additionally, the EFNA1-EPHA3 receptor-ligand complex pair was consistently present in the heart but not detected in skeletal muscle. These differences may reflect distinct microvasculatures in the two tissues due to different oxygen requirements.
We also compared the immune compartment of heart, skeletal muscle and adult kidney 79 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024075 doi: bioRxiv preprint was not as extensive and several tissue resident macrophage populations had little overlap.
We suggest that these tissue residents populations have developed transcriptional circuits tailored to the heart that differ from other tissues ( Figure 5B , 5C and Supplementary Table   G4 ).
Myeloid cells in the skeletal muscle are known to interact with satellite cells to promote myogenesis 80 . As we did not find a cardiac cell population analogous to skeletal muscle satellite cells in the heart, we considered if the heart had other potential repair mechanisms.
To identify these we compared predicted interactions ( Supplementary Table G5 ) among immune, fibroblast and myocyte populations in heart and skeletal muscle. These analyses showed that cardiac FB3 secrete FN1 and TNC which is bound by CM-expressed integrins.
In skeletal muscle, predicted cell-cell interactions between PRG4+ fibroblasts and skeletal muscle myocytes involved COL1A2 , COL6A2 and a10b1 integrins ( Figure 5D ). Skeletal muscle fibroblasts and monocytes appear to interact via the CXCR4_CXCL12 chemokine, while cardiomyocytes have a distinct interaction with macrophages as described above in Figure 4D . Altogether, these results imply interactive mechanisms are driven by different transcriptional circuits in heart and skeletal muscle. The circuit between CXCR4_CXCL12, which has been described to promote repair after myocardial infarction 81 appears to be primed by myeloid populations that initiate fibrotic repair. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024075 doi: bioRxiv preprint provide detailed insights across the repertoire of cardiac cells, including CM (excluded by scRNA-Seq) as well as EC (underrepresented in cardiac snRNA-Seq) ( Figure 1C ). We quantify the cellular composition between cardiac chambers and across donors, highlighting chamber-specific features and differences between male and female donors.
Within each cell compartment we identified prototypic lineage-specific genes, differentially-expressed genes that characterized subpopulations with enrichment in particular chambers, and genes with previously unknown cardiac expression. We validated these findings using in situ smFISH with RNAscope probes ( Figure 2G FB in atrial and ventricular tissues exhibited different transcriptional profiles and subpopulations, suggesting distinct functions. We found that ECM-producing and -organising fibroblasts, while present in atria and ventricles, differed in their mode of action, as exemplified by regional-specific expression of different collagen and ECM remodelling factor genes. Together with differences in the frequency of other cell types, we suggest that region-specific FB heterogeneity is critical to support CM across varying biophysical stimuli.
Cardiac EC are often under-studied due to their protruding nuclei, which may lead to damage during isolation. Indeed, in this study EC nuclei constituted 10.8% (atria) and 7.2% (ventricle) of cells, while immunohistochemistry data estimate that EC comprises >60% of non-myocytes in the heart 84 . By sequencing single cells and single nuclei from the same sample, we resolved seven populations including arterial, venous and lymphatic EC, and an atrial-enriched population. Using CellPhoneDB.org 85 A further cell compartment captured and analysed in depth were CD45+ immune cells. Due to their low frequency in tissues, the immune compartment is difficult to resolve using only nuclei. By performing CD45+ enrichment from the same cellular suspensions used for non-myocyte scRNA-Seq and using variational autoencoders, we identified 17 different immune cell populations across the myeloid and lymphoid lineages ( Figure 4A and 4B ). involvement. Here, we found that expression of the viral receptor ACE2 is higher in pericytes than in CM, as previously reported 87 , but also that neither pericytes nor CM express the protease that prime viral entry, TMPRSS2 . Instead CM and pericytes express CTSB and CTSL , which may also promote viral entry. ACE2 expression correlated with AGTR1
(angiotensin receptor-1) which was highest in pericytes, and consistent with its role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) signalling in cardiac hemodynamics. ACE2
cleaves the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II that binds AGTR. ACE2 -null mice have reduced cardiac contractility, myocardial ischemia and hypoxia 88 , 89 suggesting a profound role of ACE2 in the regulation of cardiovascular hemodynamics.
We expect that our results will allow further insights into other cardiac disease processes.
Going forward, our results will furthermore be of value for deconvolution of existing bulk transcriptomic data, for transfer learning in analyses of other cardiac regions (valves, papillary muscle, conduction system), and to enable interpretation of the cellular responses to human heart disease.
