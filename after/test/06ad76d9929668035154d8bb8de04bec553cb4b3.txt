The global response to the COVID-19 epidemic presents strengths 83 and weaknesses in national and regional social governance capacities to address public health 84 challenges. The emergence, detection, spread, treatment and containment of infectious diseases 85 shows the considerable political and economic impacts in a highly interconnected world 9 . 86 Understanding how the socioeconomic levels respond to the spread and treatment of COVID- 87 19 is of great significance for the success of combating the coronavirus epidemic. 88 Social and economic circumstances affect the spread and treatment of infectious diseases. 89 Conventionally, social governance measures, such as travel ban, social distancing and 90 gathering reduction, play a major role in preventing and controlling the rapid spread of the 91 epidemic in response to public health emergencies 10 .

Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause the 109 disruption of basic medical services and emergency facilities, the de-prioritisation of treatment 110 for other life-threatening diseases, conditions and for other chronic infectious diseases (e.g., 111 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, tuberculosis and malignancy) everywhere but 112 especially in some developing economies, where the health system is already fragile 16 .

Starting on February 24, 2020, the response levels of public health downgraded outside Hubei.
Chinese government adopted intensive measures to contain COVID-19. i.e., Wuhan 198 lockdown, movement restriction and home self-isolation, masking in public, national joint 199 prevention and control, information disclosure, timely and sufficient COVID-19 detection.
Masking in public is to protect oneself from infection. Since COVID-19 was proved to be 201 transmitted mainly through droplets, wearing a mask is effective in preventing virus 202 transmission. National joint prevention and control was launched down to the community level.
