162/150) 39 40 With two-thirds of the global population projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, 41 understanding the transmission patterns of viral pathogens within cities is crucial for effective 42 prevention strategies. Here, in unprecedented spatial resolution, we analysed the socioeconomic 43 determinants of influenza transmission in a European city. We combined geographical and 44 epidemiological data with whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses at the scale of urban 45 quarters and statistical blocks, the smallest geographic subdivisions within a city. We observed 46 annually re-occurring geographic clusters of influenza incidences, mainly associated with net 47 income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination against influenza 48 was also mainly associated with household income and was linked to the likelihood of influenza-49 like illness within an urban quarter. Transmissions patterns within and between quarters were 50 complex. High-resolution city-level epidemiological studies combined with social science surveys 51
such as this will be essential for understanding seasonal and pandemic transmission chains and 52 delivering tailored public health information and vaccination programs at the municipal level.
Next, we performed regression models with self-reported influenza-like illness as a binary endpoint for each individual. The factors associated with increased relative risks for self-reported 156 influenza-like illness in stepwise forward and backward selection multivariable analysis were: â‰¥3 8 higher the socioeconomic score, the higher the vaccine rate. Income showed the highest 189 correlation with vaccination rates, followed by living space and population density, respectively 190 (R 2 0.622, p=0.0067; R 2 0.618, p=0.007; R 2 0.532, p=0.0167). Self-reported vaccination rates 191 may serve as a surrogate marker for herd immunity 27, 28 
However, in years with a low vaccine effectiveness (Table S4 ) this association may be weaker.
In order to monitor antibody titres over time in a healthy population across the city, we recruited Table S1 ). Before the 2016/2017 influenza season, we observed 211 that across all urban quarters a median of 21% (IQR 17-28.5%) had seroprotective antibody levels
(defined as hemagglutination inhibition titres equal or more than 1:40 31 ) ( Figure 3A) . Again, urban 213 quarters with lower socioeconomic scores also showed low seroprotection rates (e.g. Matthaeus,
Breite, Kleinhueningen and Klybeck) ( Figure S6A ). Urban quarters with higher socioeconomic 215 scores showed a median seroprotection rate of 26.1%, whereas those with lower socioeconomic 216 scores showed a median seroprotection rate of 14.6% (p=0.05). Blood donors with influenza 217 vaccination showed significant higher H3N2 specific HI titers in comparison to people who were 218 not vaccinated (p<0.0001; Figure S6B ). Similar to the survey, in this cohort net income was Table S5 ). This visualization can be 
Next, we connected all identical influenza isolates between different urban quarters. Using 279 permutation tests, we observed a generally high exchange rate and complex transmission 280 dynamic between the different urban quarters. Some urban quarters showed significant 281 connections to other urban quarters. For example, isolates from Vorstaedte (VO) and Wettstein
(WE) were more identical in comparison to other urban quarters (p<0.005, Figure 3C ).
Transmission events within the same urban quarter were explored. Interestingly, two urban 284 quarters -Gundeldingen (GU) and Vorstaedte (VO) -showed influenza isolates that were 285 significantly more related to other isolates from within the same urban quarter than to isolates 286 from other quarters or outside of Basel (p<0.001, Figure 3C ). These two urban quarters show a 287 low socioeconomic score and lower pre-seasonal seroprotection rate. Phylogenetic cluster size 288 did not correlate with any socioeconomic factors (p=n.s.).

Each year influenza infects millions of people around the globe 36,37 . Historically, human 292 pandemics have had devastating outcomes, and preventive measures should have high priority.
Our results reflect an unprecedented large and dense datasets of PCR-confirmed influenza 294 cases, the largest city-wide survey on influenza-like illness performed to date, and influenza genome sequences, all mapped to the statistical block level. We observed annually re-occurring 296 geographic clusters of influenza cases and incidences. These influenza hot spots were mainly 297 associated with net income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination 298 against influenza was heterogeneously distributed between urban quarters and dependent mainly 299 on household income. The rate of vaccination was linked to the likelihood of contracting an 300 influenza-like illness within a specific urban quarter. Finally, transmission events between quarters 301 were highly complex, but for two urban quarters particularly high levels of transmission events 302 within the same urban quarter could be observed.
Our study has certain limitations. First, in the survey, a more research-interested population may 305 have replied to the questionnaire. In particular, 37.9% of males replied to the survey, whereas in 306 a census 48.2% were males. However, the overall reported vaccination are in line with regular 307 interviews conducted by the Federal Office of Public Health of Switzerland, which report 308 vaccination rates of >30% in people with 64 years of age and older 24 . Also, the self-reported 309 influenza-like illness rates corresponds to estimated and published attack rates 38,39 . For influenza 310 diagnostic using PCR confirmation, we cannot exclude some recruitment bias, that particular 311 people with a specific demographic background are more likely to be included at a tertiary 312 healthcare centre. In order to compensate for such a bias, we also included data from other study 313 sites including a children's hospital and family doctors and a private diagnostic laboratory which 314 also covers family doctors and other non-University hospitals in the region ( Figure S7A) . Further, 315 ecologic fallacy may link certain socioeconomic factors, therefore we adjusted our analysis for 316 population density. However, when correcting for population densities, statistical associations 317 remained stable. Although, the influenza sampling for the sequencing part of the study was 318 reasonably thorough, certainly not all influenza cases could be captured as many patients with 319 influenza will not seek healthcare. Thus, some transmission links will always remain unknown.
For more detailed analyses, future studies would need to include hundreds of samples with high 321 resolution epidemiological data across multiple influenza seasons to study the changing patterns 322 of transmission over multiple years. In addition, the transmission events across urban quarters 323 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.023135 doi: bioRxiv preprint are highly complex, driven by mobility of people living within a city and commuters, place of 324 working, and changing antibody titres of exposed patients in each year. Although we have asked 325 where a person works, we were not able to collect sufficient data for this question -only 24.6% 326 provided details and people working in the same statistical block were very rare (<5%).
Our findings provide important insights demonstrating influenza transmission patterns in a city 329 serving as a model for studying the dynamics of seasonal flu transmission and evolution within a 330 city. These results should be repeated in cities of different sizes and complexities around the 331 world to allow public health services to be tailored most effectively. It will be interesting to see 332 whether further factors concerning influenza transmission can be identified in other cities as well 333 as their role in public health measures. Importantly, since vaccination rates were strongly 334 dependent on income and linked to influenza incidences, providing better access to vaccination 335 for low income households would likely have a substantial impact on influenza transmission. The 336 knowledge gained with our study can help to tailor public health measures such as urban 337 vaccination programs to urban influenza hotspots and not just to selected target groups (e.g. high-338 risk populations with chronic illness). National vaccination recommendations often only include a 339 selected population, e.g. health care workers, patients with comorbidities or particular age groups.
Our results suggest that such strategies may entirely miss the populations where most 
This would allow us to address more and account for a greater variety of population segments 347 and help to identify potential drivers of transmission.

The overall study design has been previously published 20 . Briefly, the study had retrospective 
were returned and fulfilled the quality criteria for subsequent analysis. Returned questionnaires 389 were quality controlled and the data was entered into a database. Questionnaires were excluded 390 when no information of influenza-like illness or vaccination status was reported. Influenza-like 391 illness was defined according by the WHO as a combination of self-reported fever, coughing, and 392 illness of less than ten days 41, 42 . The questionnaires allowed the option of self-identifying one's 393 place of residence within a statistical block within the urban quarter.
Relative risks for influenza-like illness and influenza vaccination were estimated by uni-and 395 multivariable Poisson regression with robust error variance. To deal with possible confounding, 396 all variables found to differ significantly in univariable analyses between participants with and 397 without ILI and with and without influenza vaccination, respectively, were included in the 398 multivariable generalized linear models. A Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold was applied to 399 select variables for inclusion into the multivariable models. Poisson regression models using 400 stepwise forward and backward selection were applied to identify variables independently 401 associated with both primary outcomes.
To account for socioeconomic differences related to each urban quarter and potentially

At 12 study sites we recruited paediatric and adult patients fulfilling the 411 following criteria: cough, fever, and sudden disease onset -these patients with influenza-like 412 illness were further evaluated using the previously described influenza specific PCR.

Details regarding the sequencing have been previously described 33 100. Sites with a coverage of less than 100 were assumed to be unknown and were denoted as 436 N, that is any possible nucleotide. Sequences that showed a read depth of 100 for at least 80% 437 of the positions in at least four segments were used for the analysis. Non double infections with 438 two strains were noted. Using these parameters, we continued our analysis using 663 samples.
The consensus sequences from these strains were deposited in GenBank (numbers will be 440 available upon acceptance of the manuscript). We aligned the consensus sequences using The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.023135 doi: bioRxiv preprint mutations per year. Therefore, 10 SNPs can be estimated to corresponds to 3.5 months, the 451 length of a typical influenza season in Basel.

Phylogenetic trees of initial clusters. We next estimated rates of evolution for each segment using 741 the SRD06 model 60 and a strict clock model, from 200 full genome sequences sampled in 742 California, New York and Europe between 2010 and 2015, using Beast 2.5 61 . Apart from this, 743 these sequences were not otherwise used in the analysis, and as such are an independent 744 dataset. We allowed each segment to have its own phylogeny in order to avoid the possibility of 745 a reassortment biasing the estimates of evolutionary rates. Each of the segments, as well as the 746 first two and third codon position was allowed to have its own rate scaler. We ran ten independent 747 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains each for 10 8 iterations and then combined them after 748 a burn-in of 10%. These estimated evolutionary rates are long-term rates of influenza A/H3N2.
We next reconstructed the phylogenetic trees of all initial clusters by using the full genomes of all 751 samples from the initial clusters. We fixed the evolutionary rates to be equal to the mean 752 evolutionary rates as estimated using the methods above. As a population model, we used a 753 .

We then estimated a distribution of phylogenies for each initial cluster, assuming 755 that all segments share the same phylogeny. As estimated in the previous analysis, reassortment 756 will not bias evolutionary rates.
Local cluster identification. To identify sets of sequences from Basel that were likely to have been 759 transmitted locally, we reconstructed the geographic origins of lineages that were introduced into 760 Basel. Therefore, we used the phylogenetic tree distributions for each initial cluster to reconstruct 761 the ancestral states using parsimony. We made some modifications to the standard algorithm for 762 parsimony ancestral state reconstruction to reflect our prior assumption, that Basel is unlikely to 763 act as a relevant source of influenza on a global scale. If any descendent was not in Basel, the 764 node was classified as "not Basel". Since the influenza season covers only a few months, we 765 additionally assumed that lineages are unlikely to persist in Basel for more than 5 weeks (0.1 766 years) without being sampled. To reflect this assumption, we classified internal nodes that are 767 more than 0.1 years from a sample from Basel to be either outside of Basel, or to be in an unknown 
Using clusters obtained from a phylodynamic approach, we obtain a similar clustering pattern 780 meaning the pattern is robust towards how we define clusters. In particular, using the 781 phylodynamic method, we identified 96 clusters of at least two highly similar viral genomes, 782 representing influenza transmission, which together incorporated 534/663 influenza strains.

Within the city, we observed 789 323/427 (76%) of influenza strains belong to 69 of the overall 96 clusters across this single 790 influenza season. The clusters comprised a median of 3 isolates, ranging from 2 to 42 within and 791 outside of the city.
