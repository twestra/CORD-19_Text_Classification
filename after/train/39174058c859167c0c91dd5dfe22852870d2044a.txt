SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronaviridae family and is the etiological agent of the respiratory Coronavirus Disease 2019. The virus has spread rapidly around the world resulting in over two million cases and nearly 150,
The coronaviridae family of viruses causes disease in birds and mammals, including bats, camels, pigs, and humans. In lower vertebrates, pathogenic coronaviruses cause acute and severe gastrointestinal infections, fevers and organ failure. Of the seven human-tropic coronaviruses, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoVB-OC43 cause only asymptomatic or mild infections, including the common cold (4) (5) (6) . Four of the viruses are linked to severe infections;
including, hCoV-HKU1, a common cause of pneumonia, SARS-CoV-1 with a 10% mortality rate, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS-CoV) with a 37% mortality rate (3) , and SARS-CoV-2 currently with a 6% mortality rate for confirmed cases (1) . As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, the need for effective vaccines and therapeutics increases. In addition, there is currently little information about the immunological response to the virus or the potential for reinfection (7) (8) (9) (10) . Therefore, it is urgent to study SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and replication in order to find effective targets for drug and vaccine development.
Coronaviruses have a large (~ 30 kb) single-stranded, positive RNA genome that is 5'-capped, contains a 3'-poly-A tail, and are direct templates for the transcription of sub-genomic mRNAs for the translation of viral proteins. The first open reading frame produces the large non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and read-through across a frameshift results in translation of the larger nonstructural polyprotein 1ab (pp1a/b). These polyproteins are subsequently processed into sixteen non-structural proteins (nsps) that assemble to form the Replication-Transcription Complex (RTC) or function as accessory proteins necessary for viral replication. The structural and additional accessory proteins are encoded at 3'-end of the genome (11) (12) (13) (14) .
The components of the RTC include enzymes that regulate mRNA and genomic RNA synthesis, proofreading, and mRNA maturation. Two of these enzymes are critical for capping viral mRNAs, a tactic employed by multiple RNA viruses to avoid immune detection by toll-like receptors 7 (TLR7) and 8 (TLR8) (15) . In eukaryotic cells, mRNA capping is initiated by an RNA triphosphatase (TPase), which removes the γ-phosphate from the 5'-end of the nascent mRNA transcript, generating a diphosphate 5'-ppN end. An RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase)

The GpppN formation is followed by N 7 -methylation of the capping guanylate by a guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase (N 7 -MTase) to generate the Cap-0. as the methyl group donor (4, 16) .
For coronavirus mRNA maturation, the host cell TPases and GTase are used to guanylate the 5'-end of the nascent mRNA and the viral non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) N 7 -MTase activity generates the Cap-0 (4). Nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme with an exonuclease domain in addition to its N 7 -MTase domain (17) . Its activity is modulated by the binding of the small viral protein, nsp10, which specifically stimulates its exonuclease activity with no effect on its N 7 -MTase activity (16) . The coronavirus mRNAs are further modified to have a Cap-1 by the viral non-structural protein 16 (nsp16). Nsp16 is a m 7 GpppA-specific, SAM-dependent, 2'-O-MTase (18, 19) and is activated by binding to nsp10 (20) . Nsp10 is a stable protein that can self-dimerize (5) or form dodecamers when the nsp11 extension is included (6) , in addition to modulating nsp14 and nsp16 activity (21) . Although no specific enzymatic activity has been identified for nsp10 and its fold is unique, it is known as a zinc binding protein that binds nonspecifically to RNA and stabilizes the SAM binding pocket in nsp16 to form a stable complex (20) . The nsp10-nsp16-mediated 2'-Omethylation of coronavirus RNA is essential for preventing host recognition and decreasing immune response, while the viral RNA is translated (16, 18, 22) .
Multiple crystal structures of the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer have been solved, from both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (4, 19, 23) and provide some insight into the structural basis of substrate binding and the proposed sn2-mechanism of methyl transfer.

Here we present the 1.80 Å X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer with SAM bound.
Overall structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer. Nsp10 and nsp16 are encoded in the polycistronic orf1ab of the (+)ssRNA from SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1A) and are released by processing of the polyproteins by the nsp5 protease (14) . Nsp10 is released from pp1a and pp1ab, while nsp16 is part of only the pp1ab polyprotein created after a -1 ribosome shift (24) . Previous studies from SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that nsp16 is an unstable protein in several conditions and thus the protein was purified in complex following co-expression with nsp10 (25). Here, we successfully expressed and purified nsp10 and nsp16 separately using nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). After removal of the 6xHis-tags, a heterodimer of nsp16 with nsp10 was formed and concentrated by centrifugation across a 30 kDa cutoff membrane and dialyzed into crystallization buffer. The protein complex was further incubated with 2 mM SAM and diffraction quality crystals grew in A7 condition of the ComPAS (Qiagen) screen (0.2 M Calcium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 18% w/v PEG 8000).
The structure of nsp16 in complex with nsp10 and SAM was solved by molecular replacement at 1.8 Å (PDB code 6w4h) using the nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer structure from SARS-CoV-1 (PDB code 3r24) as the model. The diffraction data are presented in Table 1 and a representative image of the structures is shown in Figure 1 . The crystal belonged to the space group P3121 with two polypeptide chains, one chain of nsp10 and one chain of nsp16 in the asymmetric unit, which form a heterodimer. The heterodimer has a total solvent-exposed surface area of 19,710 Å 2 estimated by PISA (Fig. 1B) . This heterodimer is mainly stabilized by .

In parallel with this work, a nearly identical structure with the same space group was solved at 2.0 Å (PDB code 6w61). The crystal obtained for this structure was prepared by a distinct procedure (see materials and methods). A third structure was also solved at 1.95 Å (PDB code 6w75) by the same methods used for the first structure. The third crystal form belongs to the P3221 space group with twice the unit cell than first two. In this structure, there are four polypeptide chains, which form a tetramer, and this structure will be described later. For this report, only highest resolution structure (PDB code 6w4h) is discussed in detail. nsp10 and nsp16 are highly conserved among lineage B of the beta coronaviruses. In order to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 has amino acid variation in the 2-O'MTase that could impact its function, we compared the primary amino acid sequences of nsp10 and nsp16 proteins to that of other beta-coronaviruses ( Fig. 3 A and B) . Nsp10 was found to be 100% identical to Bat-CoV-RaTG13, 99% identical to SARS-CoV-1, and 98% identical to Bat-SARS-like coronavirus (Bat-SL-CoV) isolate Rs4247, but only 59% identical to MERS-CoV ( Figure 3A ). In the aligned sequences, the zinc coordinating residues C74, C77, H83, C90, C117, C120, C128, and C130 are 100% conserved, emphasizing the importance of zinc binding for nsp10 activity during the viral replication-transcription processes. Thus, nsp10 is highly conserved in the lineage B betacoronaviruses, and less conserved with lineage C beta coronaviruses. Similarly, nsp16 from SARS-CoV-2 is 100% identical to Bat-CoV-RaTG13, 93% identical to Bat-SL-CoV Rs4247, and 95% identical to SARS-CoV-1 ( Figure 3B ), but only 66% identical to MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 contains the highly conserved K46, D130, K170, E203 (KDKE) motif for methyl-transfer found in many 2¢-O-MTases (22), including the more phylogenetically distant MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we confirmed that residues N43, Y47, G71, A72, S74, G81, D99, N101, L100, D114, and M131, which coordinate SAM substrate binding in SARS-CoV-1 through hydrogen bonds and water-mediated interactions (4), are also 100% conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2F) . The high conservation of nsp10 and nsp16 sequences, and the identification of 100% conserved catalytic and substrate-binding residues suggest that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 function and structure are also highly conserved.
In the primary sequence alignments of nsp10, there are only two amino acid differences (A34P and K113) between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. These changes do not affect the structure of nsp10 or its interactions with Zn 2+ or nsp16. On the other hand, there are 18 amino acid differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp16 sequences ( Figure 3 A and B ).
Many of these amino acid variations in SARS-Cov-2 occurred on the solvent-exposed surface 
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has yielded a world-wide effort to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in virus transmission, virulence, and replication. The ultimate goal is to identify viral proteins that are amenable for drug targeting and epitopes suitable for vaccine development. Although, previous studies conducted in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV enlighten the pathway for drug discovery and vaccine development, no approved treatments were fully developed. In addition, due to the high replication error rate of ssRNA viruses, small amino acid variations could cause resistance to previously described drugs or antibodies, as well as increase the pathogenicity. Thus, in order to ensure an accurate approach for drug discovery, the CSGID implemented a structural genomics pipeline to solve the structure of proteins essential for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Here we presented the structure of the 2¢-O-MTase, nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer in complex with SAM at 1.8 Å resolution, which shares 98% identity with the 2¢-O-MTase of SARS-CoV-1. All the amino acid variations in the new SARS-CoV-2 were located at the solvent exposed surface of the heterodimer, and not among the residues of the catalytic site, substrate binding site, or interface between nsp10-nsp16. Furthermore, the only identified discrepancies in our model versus previous models were in the flexible loop regions 28-38 and 131-148 and the N-and C-terminal residues. As the 2¢-O-MTase activity of nsp10-nsp16 is required for viral replication-transcription in host cells, these structural data can be used for developing new specific treatments against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the structure reported here is the highest resolution structure thus far of a coronavirus 2¢-O-MTase and is amenable for computational modeling of potential inhibitors.

In order to increase the probability to obtain high quality crystals suitable for structure determination, the CSGID implemented two different approaches, which are listed here and identified by their PDB accession code.
The genes from nsp10 and nsp16 were codon optimized for expression in E. coli, synthetized (Twist Bioscience) and cloned into pMCSG53 (31) 
Frozen pellets were thawed and sonicated at 50% amplitude, in 5 s x 10 s cycle for 20 min at 4°C.
The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 40 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected, and the protein was purified as previously described with some modifications (34) . The supernatant was loaded into a His-Trap FF (Ni-NTA) column using a GE Healthcare ÅKTA Pure The complex was concentrated to 5.5 mg/ml and set up for crystallization immediately.
The pure nsp10-nsp16 complex (1:1 ratio for nsp10 and nsp16) + SAM was set up as 2 µl crystallization drops in (1µl protein:1µl reservoir solution) in 96-well plates (Corning) and equilibrated using commercially available Classics II, PEG's II, Anions and ComPas Suites (Qiagen). Diffraction quality crystals appeared after 5 days in condition A7 of the ComPAS screen (0.2 M Calcium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 18% w/v PEG 8000).
The data set was collected on the LS-CAT 21-ID-F beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the Argonne National Laboratory. A total of 200 images, which corresponded to 120 degrees of the spindle axis rotation were collected. Images were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL-3000 (35) .

The structure of native nsp10-nsp16 complex crystal from SARS-CoV-2 was solved by Molecular Replacement with Phaser (36) from the CCP4 Suite (37) using the crystal structure of the nsp10/nsp16 heterodimer from SARS (PDB ID 3r24) as a search model. Initial solutions went through several rounds of refinement in REFMAC v. 5.8.0258 (38) and manual model corrections using Coot (39) . The water molecules were generated using ARP/wARP (40) with the assigned PDB code 6wh4.
