Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy. 12 the outbreak containment. 13 We consider here deterministic compartmental models, based on a system of initial 14 value problems of Ordinary Differential Equations. This theory has been studied since 15 the beginning of the century by W.O. Kermack and A. G. MacKendrick [3] who 16 proposed the basic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The SIR model and its 17 later modifications, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) [4] were later 18 introduced in the study of outbreaks diffusion. These models split the population into 19
The recent diffusion of the COVID-19 Corona-virus has renewed the interest of the 2 scientific and political community in the mathematical models for the epidemic. Many 3 researchers are making efforts for proposing new refined models to analyse the present 4 situation and predict possible future scenarios. 5 With this paper, we hope to contribute to the ongoing research on this topic and to 6 give a practical instrument for a deeper comprehension of the virus spreading features 7 and behaviour. 8 The modelling of infectious diseases is currently performed by Ordinary Differential 9 Equations (ODEs) deterministic compartmental models [1] or by stochastic 10 procedures [2] . The tuning of the parameters of the equations allows better modelling of 11 environmental features, such as social restrictions or changes of political strategies in groups, compartments, and reproduce their behaviour by formalising their reciprocal 20 interactions. For example, the SIR model groups are Susceptible who can catch the 21 disease, Infected who have the disease and can spread it, and Removed those who have 22 either had the disease or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovery. The SEIR 23 model proposed by Chowell et al. [5] also considers the Exposed group: containing 24 individuals who are in the incubation period. 25 The evolution of the Infected group depends on a critical parameter, usually denoted 26 as R0, representing the basic reproductive rate and it measures of how transferable a 27 disease is. This quantity determines whether the infection will spread exponentially, die 28 out, or remain constant. When R 0 > 1 the epidemic is spreading. The value of R0 can 29 be inferred, for example, by epidemic studies or by statistical data from literature or it 30 can be calibrated from the available data. In this paper, we use the available data for 31 determining the value of R0. 32 Compared to previous outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [6] , when the Analogously, in the Italian case, to limit the virus diffusion all over the Italian area, 40 the government has started to impose more and more severe restrictions since March 41 10th 2020. Hopefully, these measures affect the spread of the COVID-19 virus, reducing 42 the number of infected people and the value of the parameter R0.
The introduction of different levels of lockdown requires an adaptation of the 44 standard epidemic models to this new situation, see [6] [7] [8] for some example related to 45 the Chinese outbreak. Concerning the Italian situation, the outbreak started in 46 Lombardia on February 21st, and it is still affecting more and more regions. In the 47 beginning, severe lockdown measures were imposed in very restricted areas and only 48 after March 10th uniform restrictions were imposed all over the country. 49 We believe that a more flexible, time-dependent parameter related to the infection 50 rate, not only could it give a better fit of the measured data, but it also allows us to 51 represent possible future scenarios caused by different policies of the Italian 52 Government. In this paper, we propose to represent the infection rate as a piecewise 53 time-dependent function, which reflects the changes in external conditions. The 54 parameter R0, which is proportional to the infection rate, becomes a time-dependent 55 parameter R t and it follows a different trend each time the external conditions change, 56 depending on the particular situation occurring in that period. For example, the 57 application of new restrictions to the population movements at time t 0 should hopefully 58 cause a decrease of R t when t > t 0 .
The idea of modelling the introduction of restricting measures through a 60 non-constant infection rate has been proposed in [5] with the available data, may not depict the Italian situation accurately. Of course, the 76 proposed model could be easily applied to new and possibly improved data.
Concerning the prevision obtained by applying the proposed model for times beyond 78 the measured interval, we remind that, as for all forecasts, the more considerable the 79 distance is from the observed data, the more unreliable is the forecast. However, the 80 model flexibility allows us to adapt it to changes in the data trends.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 1, we describe the details of SEIRD Infectious (I) and Removed(R), containing recovered and dead people. The more recent 96 SEIR model adds the Exposed (E) group to the previous one, representing people that 97 infected but not infectious. SEIR has been used to model breakouts, such as Ebola in 98 Congo and Uganda [4, 5] . In [4] the equations are modified by adding the quarantine 99 and vaccination coefficients. In our case, unfortunately, vaccination is not available.
In this paper we use a SEIRD model [10] , where the class of Removed in the SEIR 101 model is partitioned into the Recovered (again labelled with (R)) and Dead (D). Hence 102 SEIRD consider five classes: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), Recovered (R) 103 and Dead (D). Their sum, at each time t, is the total number N of individuals in the 104 examined population, i.e. N = S + E + I + R + D. The system of equations in the 105 SEIRD model is given by:

where N is the total population, β is the infection rate, a coefficient accounting for the 107 susceptible people get infected by infectious people, α represents the number of days for 108 the transition from Exposed to Infectious (i.e. the incubation rate), T I is the average 109 infectious period and f is the fraction of individuals who die. 110 The system (1) of ODEs is solved by starting from an initial time t = t 0 where the 111 values of the populations S(t 0 ), E(t 0 ), I(t 0 ), R(t 0 ), D(t 0 ) are assigned on the basis of the 112 available data at that time and integrated up to a final time T .
Following [10] , we compute the basic reproduction number R0 as follows:
In order to consider different external conditions affecting the outbreak data, we 
A similar model for the infection rate in SEIR equations can be found in [5] , where 123 the function is assumed to have a decreasing exponential form. However, observing the 124 data trend, we have proved that the exponential β(t) has a too fast decreasing 125 behaviour and we choose to model it as a decreasing rational function:

Parameter estimation 129 We calibrate the parameters of SEIRD (1) and SEIRD(rm) (4) equations by solving 130 non-linear least squares problems with positive constraints. For example, in the SEIRD 131 model (1), we define the function u(t) = (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)), depending on the 132 vector of parameters q = (β, α, f ), and the vector y of the acquired data at given times 133 t k , k = 1, . . . p. Let F (u, q) be the function computing the numerical solution u of the 134 differential system (1), the estimation of the parameter q is obtained solving the 135 following non linear least-squares problem:

By changing the number of partition points t k of the simulation domain and the weights 161 ρ k , for each formula it is possible to take into account the different restriction measures 162 and estimate possible developments of the epidemic, such as the behaviour of the 163 Infected, Recovered or Dead individuals. 164 2 Results
In this section, we apply the SEIRD (1) and the SEIRD(rm) (4) models to monitor the 166 Covid-19 outbreak in Italy during the period 24/02/2020-27/03/2020. The epidemic 167 spread started on February 21st affecting the northern regions. Lombardia in particular 168 registered the first sources of epidemic followed by the Veneto and Emilia-Romagna.
Since initially each region applied different containment measures to some restricted 170 areas, at different times, we choose to calibrate the SEIRD and SEIRD(rm) models in 171 each region separately.

• Simulation. This step applies the SEIRD(rm) (4) model, with the identified 179 parameters, to monitor the epidemic evolution in subsequent times. Since 180 currently the epidemic has not still reached the peak of infection, we test different 181 types of variable infections rates (7), (8), (9) to predict the possible evolution. To test the precision of our data estimation process, we consider the following relative error between the vector X mod of the modelled data and the vector X data of the the measured data for the days 1, 2 . . . 31:
where X represents the considered model compartment {S,E,I,R,D} respectively, and 192 · is the Euclidean distance. 
From the values reported in table 1 we observe that the parameters obtained from 31 198 days mostly lead to worse errors, compared to those obtained from the first 18 days.

We observe from the values of R t , reported in Fig.6 , that R t > 2 in both regions, 223 meaning that the epidemic is still spreading, although less than in the first days. .

In the following, we denote as [t p , t s ] the prevision interval [28/3/2020, 20/10/2020]. 230 Applying SEIRD(rm), calibrated in section 2.2, to the whole prevision interval, we 231 obtain quite dramatic forecasts, as evident in In Fig. 7 , we can see, for example, the trend of Infected individuals in both regions. 235 Although the actual SEIRD(rm) model fits the observations quite accurately, we believe These results represent the best situation, where the restriction measures have the 247 strongest impact.

The piecewise rational model β r 250 provides the most pessimistic prevision, with about 77000 infectious people and more 251 than 233000 dead (Fig. 9) . Concerning the epidemic spread we can appreciate the 252 different behaviours of the basic reproduction function R t in Fig. 11 . The Table 256  9 shows that again the piecewise exponential model predicts the peaks sooner than the 257 others and with the lowest number of Infected, Recovered and Dead (see figures Fig. 15, 258  14, 13) .

We 269 have considered three different time-dependent functions to describe the infection rate 270 coefficient and shown the simulation results obtained with each of them in Lombardia 271 and Emilia-Romagna. 272 We highlight that only a few days passed since restrictions started in Italy and, 273 maybe in the next few days, the effects of such measures will be more evident, hopefully 274 causing a further decrease in the infection trend. In this case, the previsions shown in 275 this paper should be updated by introducing a new time intervals at which the 276 decreasing slope of β t should be easily changed by simply modifying one parameter.
The proposed model is flexible and can be quickly adapted to monitor various 278 infected areas with different restriction policies. Moreover, the parameters ρ i , now fixed, 279 as in table (3), could be estimated in the future by an identification procedure.
