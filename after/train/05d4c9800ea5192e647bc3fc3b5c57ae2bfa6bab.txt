Coronaviruses are genetically classified into four main genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, 55
Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [12] . The first two genera generally infect mammals, 56 while the last two mostly cause disease in birds. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges between 57 approximately 26-32 kb and includes about 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) [13] . Nucleocapsid 58 protein (N), small envelope protein (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S) and matrix protein (M) are 59 the four major structural proteins of coronavirus and all of which are essential to produce a 60 structurally complete virus [14, 15] . The nucleocapsid protein (N) is a multifunctional protein 61 comprising three distinct and highly conserved domains: two structural and independently folded 62 structural regions, namely the N terminal domain and C-terminal domain, which are separated by a 63
intrinsically disordered RNA-binding domain [16] . The primary role of CoV N protein is to package 64 the genomic viral genome into flexible, long, helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes called 65
nucleocapsids [17] . Apart from these, N protein is essential for viral assembly, envelope formation, 66
genomic RNA synthesis, cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenesis [18] [19] [20] . Spike glycoprotein 67 (S) is a viral fusion protein which forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface[21] and 68
mediates virus entry to cell [22] . S contains two functional subunits: S1 & S2 subunits. The S1 69 subunit includes the receptor-binding domain(s) and contributes to stabilization of the membrane-70 anchored S2 subunit that contains the fusion machinery [23] . As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is 71 surface-exposed and mediates entry into host cells and N nucleocapsid protein are essential for 72 genome replication, these could be the main targets for designing therapeutics [24] . 73 74 Table 1 Rules/Algorithm to construct siRNAs.

Higher interaction between the target and the guide strand serves a better predictor for siRNA 143 efficacy. Therefore, the thermodynamic interaction between the target strand and the siRNA guide 144 strand was predicted with the aid of DuplexFold CoV-2 from around the world. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a small number sequences form 235 significant clades with a bootstrap value greater than 60%. (Fig 2, Supplementary Table 8 ). 236
Conserved portions that are shorter than 21 nucleotides were omitted from further analysis. 237
Conserved sequences were put to siDirect web server to identify possible targets and to generate 238 corresponding siRNAs. siDirect performs the task in three distinct steps -highly functional siRNA 239 selection, seed-dependent off-target effects reduction, near-perfect matched genes elimination. 240 siRNA targets were found in 18 conserved regions, 5 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary  241  Table 4 ) and 13 surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 5 the prediction of prospective secondary structure and determination of free energy of corresponding 264
folding is crucial. Here, guide strands of predicted siRNAs were subjected to RNA structure web 265 server in order to predict possible folding structures and corresponding minimum free energies. At 266 37â€¢C, finally selected siRNAs have free energy of folding greater than zero (Fig 3, Table 2 In this study, eight prospective siRNA molecules were proposed to be efficient at binding and 290

Computational methods can be employed to design and predict siRNA interaction against specific 298 gene target thereby silencing its expression. In this research, eight siRNA molecules were predicted 299 to be effective against nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein gene of 139 strains of 300 SARS-CoV-2 virus using computational method considering all maximum parameters in prime 301

In order to decelerate the COVID-19 pandemic and recover the affected individuals the 302 development of siRNA therapeutic approaches could be a promising alternative to traditional 303 vaccine designing. into the endosomes. siRNA escape endosomes and release siRNA into the cytoplasm due to pH 510 responsive mechanism or proton sponge effect. Once generated, siRNA is loaded into RNA-indiced 511 silencing complex comprising of RNA-binding protein TRBP and Argonaute (AGO2 was set to 500 and Tamura-Nei model of evolution was used for both trees. 520 in on .
