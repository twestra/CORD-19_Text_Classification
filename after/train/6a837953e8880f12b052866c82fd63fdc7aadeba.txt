Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was initially identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, causing an ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (1, 2) . Although the epidemic in China has come under control through strict containment precautions over the past two months, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries and regions
(3). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), however, its transmission efficiency is much higher than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is no indication that transmission will cease as the weather gets warmer. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced COVID-19 is now a global pandemic, and that there is a long battle ahead to fight the virus (4).
At present, there is no effective medication to treat the disease and it might take a year for a vaccine to be developed. The only way to control the outbreak of the virus is to identify and quarantine the infected individuals. COVID-19 is characterized by similar symptoms as the common cold such as fever, non-productive cough, fatigue, and featured chest CT patterns that may also cause fatal complications, as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (5, 6). The etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on a nucleic acid test with Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) using specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swab (7). However, high numbers of false negatives have been All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

There are many factors that can cause false negatives, and the specimen collection via nasopharyngeal swab could be the major challenge as the chance for the virus to move to the upper respiratory tract is smaller via non-productive cough. Degradation of the virus mRNA due to specimen inactivation at 56â„ƒ is another cause for false negative result (8) .
The limited detection efficacy of RT-PCR for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection requires the need for a more sensitive test to effectively identify COVID-19 patients for a better control of the virus transmission and proper treatment of the disease.
Detection of specific serum antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 could provide an alternative solution and compensate for the limitations of the nucleic acid test. It has been well established that IgM antibodies are generated and released into the blood soon after the viral infection, followed by IgG antibodies, therefore the detection of the specific antibodies in blood is a sensitive measurement for viral infection. It has been reported that the IgM antibodies can be detected in the blood from 7 days, and begins to decrease 10 days after the disease onset, while IgG antibodies can be detected [8] [9] days after the disease onset and continues to increase rapidly thereafter (9) .
Commercial and non-commercial serological tests are currently under development.

The performance of the assays has been evaluated at 10 hospitals, demonstrating high specificity and high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Being an effective way to compensate for the false negative issue of RT-PCR, the fully automated SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG immunoassays provided a powerful means of laboratory diagnosis for fighting against the global spread of the virus.
Using pFastBac1 vector, the plasmids were constructed by inserting gene fragments for expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein based on the published SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequence on Genbank (MN908947.3). They were then transfected into the insect cell Sf9 to express SARS-CoV-2 fusion proteins, which were then purified by a combination of affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Screening and verification for the specificity and sensitivity of the recombined SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein were performed using SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG immunoassay system.

The SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are two-step immunoassays for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in human serum and plasma, using direct chemiluminometric microparticle technology (10, 11) . The assays are performed on a fully automated immunoassay analyzer (manufactured by YHLO Biotech).

Four serum samples (one negative and three positives for SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and
three serum samples (one negative and two positives for SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were measured twice-a-day in duplicates over the span of 20 days, and 80 data points were obtained on each serum. Results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 . The repeatability of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM is from 2.80% to 4.32%, and the within-laboratory precision is from 3.02% to 4.45%. The repeatability of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG is from 3.11% to 4.30%, and the within-laboratory precision is from 3.12% to 5.13%.
