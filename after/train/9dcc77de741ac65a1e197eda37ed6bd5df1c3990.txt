The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent and unprecedented need for rapid 29 large-scale diagnostic testing to inform timely patient management. This study compared two 30 recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-31
CoV-2 to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs were 32 tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed C t values on the cobas assay. 33
Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with 34
Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID 35
Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (C t 36 value <30). However, for C t values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% 37 for Xpert. These findings highlight an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in 38 viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations. Further studies are needed to 39 evaluate the performance of ID Now for direct swabs. 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
Severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in 52
December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across the world, causing a global pandemic of 53 coronavirus disease . The majority of cases are mild to moderate, but severe 54
infections have overwhelmed healthcare systems in the United States, particularly in New York 55
City. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral RNA from nasal or nasopharyngeal 56 swabs has become the standard method used to confirm diagnosis. The first quantitative RT-PCR 57 test for detecting SARS-CoV2 was designed and distributed in January 2020 by the World 58
Health Organization (WHO) (1). In the United States and many other countries, however, the 59 slow rollout of large-scale diagnostic testing and the long turnaround times associated with 60 laboratory tests, particularly those sent to reference laboratories, have significantly hampered 61 public health efforts to contain the outbreak. 62
In contrast, commercially-available rapid diagnostic assays can better inform timely 63 patient management decisions to guide the need for quarantine, isolation, contact tracing, and 64 therapeutic management. Beginning in March 2020, multiple SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests received 65
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 66
However, manufacturer submissions for EUA only require evaluation of the limit of detection 67 and cross-reactivity of their assays, and do not address other important performance 68 characteristics such as accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. In addition, most manufacturer 69 submissions include studies of contrived positive samples with spiked viral RNA, and do not 70 assess performance on clinical patient specimens. Two recently-authorized rapid tests, Xpert 71

While limited studies on these two assays have been recently published, the number 74 of patient samples evaluated to date has been relatively small, and significant questions remain 75 about the accuracy of these tests across the full spectrum of viral loads (2) (3) (4) The cobas assay utilizes RT-PCR to amplify and detect two viral targets: ORF1 a/b, a 103 non-structural region that is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and a conserved region in the E-gene, which 104 is a structural protein envelope for pan-Sarbecovirus detection. The Xpert assay is an automated 105 RT-PCR that amplifies and detects two viral targets: N2, a nucleocapsid recombinant protein 106 unique to SARS-CoV-2 and a region in the structural envelope E-gene. The ID Now assay uses 107
proprietary isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for qualitative detection of SARS-108
CoV-2 RdRp gene using fluorescent reporter probes. Of the 113 patient specimens, 111 were from adults ranging in age from 23 to 101 years 116 and two were from pediatric patients, aged 1 day and 5 days old. The average age was 65 years 117 .

Overall, the majority of positive samples 118 were from males (60.2%) and negative samples from females (68.0%) ( Table 1) . 119
Testing results by Abbott ID Now and Cepheid Xpert are shown in Table 2 detection of the E-gene target but not the N2 target. There were also two samples that tested 128 negative by cobas but positive by the Xpert. These samples had C t values >40 for the N2 target 129 only without detection of the E-gene target. For the E-gene target, C t values were generally 1 130 cycle lower for Xpert than cobas (Supplemental Materials, Table S1 and Figure S1 ). have been published to date on the relative performance characteristics of these assays, 138 especially for patient specimens representing a wide range of viral concentrations (2, 3) . 139

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 25, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 In this comparative analysis, the Xpert assay showed a very high level of agreement with 140 the cobas assay across the entire range of tested C t values, including low-level positives. These 141 findings confirm those published by Moran et al. (2) and show a high level of agreement 142 between these two assays using an expanded number of positive clinical samples. In contrast, the 143 ID Now assay reliably detected specimens with C t values â‰¤30, but did not detect the majority of swabs eluted in transport media, it is important to note that the EUA for ID NOW was recently 148 updated to remove the indication for swabs in transport media (5). Our data support that the EUA 149 was appropriately modified, as samples may become too dilute in VTM and low-level positives 150 may falsely test negative. 151
In contrast to batch testing and the higher complexity required for the cobas assay, both 152
Xpert and ID Now offer shorter turnaround times and availability in near-patient settings. 153
However, the two assays differ in throughput capacity and run time. Each ID Now platform can 154 run only a single specimen at a time, with results available in 13 minutes or less. Xpert can be 155 run on larger, random-access platforms that allow for significantly higher throughput, with 156 results available in 45 minutes. Both assays are available for use in POC settings, which 157 introduces both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, POC molecular testing delivers the 158 shortest possible interval between sample collection and result, which can facilitate faster clinical 159 decision-making. However, concerns related to assay performance, quality management, and 160 safety in the POC setting still remain. Studies of POC molecular testing for influenza and 161 respiratory syncytial virus have shown promising results, but also highlight some of these 162 .

The risk of contamination and false positives is also much higher when testing is 163 performed outside of a controlled environment and by non-laboratory trained personnel. 164
Nevertheless, the unique circumstances of a rapidly-spreading pandemic may ultimately 165 necessitate the widescale adoption of POC assays in completely new patient settings, such as 166 walk up or drive-thru testing centers. 167
Limitations of this study include the relatively few number of samples from pediatric 168 patients, as only two samples from patients aged 1 day and 5 days were included, and both of 169 these were negative on all three testing methods. We were also only able to evaluate ID Now for 170 specimens in transport media. The performance of this assay with direct nasal swabs requires 171 further evaluation in subsequent studies. Another limitation is the use of the cobas assay as the 172 comparator assay. Two samples that were identified as positive only by Xpert on the basis of N2 173 nucleocapsid gene detection were negative for both targets on cobas. Whether these samples 174 were truly positive or truly negative could not be determined. 175
Fast, readily available, and reliable test results are critically important during this 176 pandemic, and each of the three assays evaluated in this study holds promise to deliver valuable 177 clinical information. Further head-to-head comparisons of molecular tests will be important in 178 order to establish the usefulness of each method and to help medical providers determine the 179 most appropriate diagnostic tests to best serve their communities.
