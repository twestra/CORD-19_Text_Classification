The COVID-19 outbreak presents a new, life-threatening disease. Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children.
Electronic databases from their inception to March, 31 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19.
A total of 23 studies of indirect evidence with 6008 patients were included.
The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on mortality (risk ratio [RR]= 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.30) and probability of negative PCR test (RR=0.98, 95 CI% 0.82 to 1.18). Arbidol had no benefit on probability of negative PCR test (RR=1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.73). Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with increasing the probability of negative PCR result (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) but had no effect on mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38).

There is no evidence showing the effectiveness of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of existing antiviral agents is still uncertain. We do not suggest clinical routine use of antivirals for COVID-19 in children, with the exception of clinical trials.
field to identify studies that may have been missed.
The search strategy was also peer reviewed by an external specialist. We systematically searched by combining the MeSH and free words. The keywords and terms in the MEDLINE including "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "Novel coronavirus", "2019-novel coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", "antiviral agents", "antiviral*", "ribavirin", "interferon", "oseltamivir", "remdesivir", "lopinavir", "ritonavir", "LPV/r" and their derivatives. The details of the search strategy can be found in the Supplementary Material 1.
We primarily searched for studies on children less than 18 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. We made no restrictions on gender, race, or geographical location or setting. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical controlled trials (CCTs) and cohort studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents (including but not limited to IFN, oseltamivir, LPV/r, RBV, HCQ and remdesivir) with placebo, or comparing the combination of antiviral agents and symptomatic treatment with symptomatic treatment alone. Studies comparing different types and different administration mode of antiviral agents were also included. In vitro studies, animal experiments and basic researches were excluded. Duplicates, articles written in languages other than English or Chinese, conference abstracts and studies where full text could not be retrieved or data were missing were also excluded.
The primary outcomes were mortality and the risk of serious adverse effects (defined as hemolytic anemia, bradycardia and other side effects on cardiovascular system and drug-induced liver injury). The secondary outcomes included the probability of negative PCR test (defined as the rate of negative PCR of SARS-CoV-2 after discharge from the hospital or after receiving antiviral agents which differed in studies), mean or reduction in the dose of corticosteroids, remission of the main clinical symptoms, risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), duration of disease (defined as the duration (in days) of total stay from symptom onset to recovery), probability of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and other adverse reactions. All the reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies were recorded, and the process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram. used, and discrepancies were discussed, or solved with a third researcher (Q Zhou). The reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies were recorded. The process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram. (23)
Four researchers (Q Shi, X Wang, Q Zhou and J Liao) extracted data independently in pairs with a pre-determined form, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. We extracted the following data: 1) basic information; 2) participants: baseline characteristics and inclusion/exclusion criteria; 3) details of the intervention and control strategies; and 4) outcomes (for dichotomous data, the number of events and total participants in per group; for continuous data, means, standard deviations (SD), and the number of total participants in per group).
Two researchers (Y Yu and Z Wang) independently assessed the potential bias in each included study. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus to a third researcher (S Lu). For RCTs we used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB) assessment tool consisting seven domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. (24) We graded each potential source of bias as "Low", "Unclear" or "High". For included CCTs, we used ROBINS-I tool, (25) which consists of seven domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to departures from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in outcome measurement, and bias in selective reporting. The risk of each type of bias was graded as "Low", "Moderate", "Serious", "Critical", and "No information". For both RoB and ROBINS-I, the overall risk of bias within each study was based on the results of all the individual domains. For cohort studies, we used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) consisting of three domains (selection of exposure, comparability and assessment of outcome). (26) The maximum score was nine, and scores of seven or more was graded as high quality while less than seven scores as low quality.
We performed Meta-analyses of outcomes for which the data that were sufficiently compatible. For outcomes with too heterogeneous data, a qualitative synthesis was done.
We processed the data according to the Cochrane Handbook by using a random-effects model. (27) For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); for continuous data, we calculated weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Two-sided P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. (28) Analyses were performed by Stata 14 software (Stata Corp LLC).
For missing SDs, standard errors (SE) were converted to SDs when SE was presented, and if both were missing, we estimated SDs from P values or 95% CI. For Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square and the I 2 statistic, with P < 0.10 was considered to be consistent with statistically significant heterogeneity and IÂ² statistic > 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. (28) If we detected heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses (route, dose, frequency or administration of antivirals) or sensitivity analyses (excluding studies with low-quality or high risk of bias;
excluding studies in which mean or SD, or both of them were imputed for missing data)
to explore the reasons. Publication bias was assessed by examining the symmetry of the funnel-plot.
We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and classified the evidence quality as "high", "moderate", "low" and "very low". (30-31) We also produced "Summary of Findings"tables. Direct evidence from RCTs starts at high quality, and evidence from observational studies at low quality. In the next step, the quality can be downgraded for five different reasons (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) and upgraded for three reasons (large magnitude of effect, dose-response relation and plausible confounders or biases). 1 1 
We identified 4095 references from the databases, and six records from additional searches. A total of 1216 records were excluded as duplicates, after screening for titles, abstract and full texts, no direct evidence for children with COVID-19 was found.
Finally, a total of 23 studies (six RCTs and 17 cohort studies) with 6008 patients of indirect evidence were included ( Figure 1 ) (32-54). These studies were published between 2003 and 2020 and the sample size ranged from 22 to 1701, of which, seven studies were on COVID-19, 13 studies on SARS and three studies on MERS. Another study of Cai 2020 was found but in temporary removal condition, therefore it was not included (55).
The risk of bias in the included three RCTs were high, as they did not perform allocation concealment and blindness for patients and clinicians. The other three RCTs had low risk of bias (n=3). More than half of the cohort studies (n=9) had a high risk of bias, the main reasons were being the lack of controlling for important factors that would influence the primary study results, lack of long enough follow-up for outcomes to occur, and inadequate outcome ascertainment. Study characteristics and risk of bias are illustrated in Table 1 .
The results of the Meta-analysis for each type of antiviral agent are shown in Table 2 .

The results showed that IFN therapy decreased the dose of corticosteroids dose (WMD=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) and promoted the remission of radiographic abnormalities. No statistically significant difference was found in mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88, Figure 2 ). No obvious adverse reactions were reported in any of the above four studies. The quality of evidence was very low.
One cohort study with a total of 24 patients (43) There was no statistically difference in the risk of death (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06, Figure 2 ). In addition, the use of RBV was associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions, including anemia (RR=1.67, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.61, low-quality 
Two cohort studies with a total of 393 patients (50-51) reported the effectiveness and safety of a combination of RBV and IFN for adult patients with MERS. The results

One study with a total of 236 patients (52) In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions (RR=1.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.50) between HCQ therapy and the control group.
The overall quality of evidence was low.

Our rapid review identified a total of 23 studies. No direct evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 was available. Based on the analysis of indirect evidence from adult patients with COVID-19, very low to low-quality evidence indicated that LPV/r, arbidol and hydroxychloroquine were not effective. For adult patients with SARS or MERS, very low to low-quality evidence indicated that LPV/r, IFN, RBV and oseltamivir had no clinical effectiveness on mortality, corticosteroids dose, or other main outcomes. Certain medications, such as LPV/r and RBV, were likely to lead to adverse reactions (such as gastrointestinal reaction, abnormal liver function, anemia, bradycardia, or hypoxemia). The results on other antivirals were similar to those identified in other systematic reviews. Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ was effective for clinical recovery which is the same as published reviews (17-18), but we found HCQ had no benefit on probability of viral load disappearance, this is not the same as previous All rights reserved.

All trials for HCQ included in this study had small sample size to draw robust conclusions. IFN had no benefit on mortality and the effect did not differ between IFN-Î± and IFN-Î²: the results are in line with another recent rapid review. (14) RBV and oseltamivir were not shown effective for treating adults with SARS, and the use of RBV was even related to a high risk of serious side effects, and oseltamivir prolonged the duration of disease. These results were also observed by recent and previous systematic reviews. (15, (65) (66) One study demonstrated that the concentration of RBV required to effectively inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was beyond the clinically acceptable range, so routine use of the drug would have no effect. has imposed a great socioeconomic, public health, and clinical burden on the affected countries and regions, especially for the low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, priority should be given for the research and implementation of agents with promising outcomes.

This is a major obstacle to a clear interpretation of the results of this review. Third, because of the specificity and urgency of PHEIC, our study protocol was not registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews Platform.
We suggest for the further actions on the basis of our study. First, high-quality clinical research should be carried out in a timely and effective manner, following the randomization, control and bind principles of evidence-based medicine, trying to adopt objective and representative outcomes for evaluation, so that unbiased research results All rights reserved.

Second, health workers need high-quality, unbiased and evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice. Health workers should accumulate clinical experience and be encouraged to interpret the evidence with professionalism by cooperating with researchers, avoid conflicts of interest, and thus reduce the possibly harmful impact on children with COVID-19. Third, health policy decisions should be made based on the best available evidence and make full use of the limited resources to make decisions that are valid, rational and based on up-to-date scientific knowledge.
In conclusion, there is no direct evidence for antiviral agents in children with COVID-19 so far. Very low to low-quality indirect evidence indicated that antiviral agents were not effective for reducing mortality, and the effectiveness and safety of antivirals for children with COVID-19 are uncertain. Therefore, we cannot suggest routine use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 in children, with the exception of clinical trials after thorough ethical assessment. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
