ABSTRACT 49 Background and Aims: Cumulating observations have indicated that patients with 50 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) undergo different patterns of liver impairment. We 51 performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver 52 damage in COVID-19.
53 Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library, 54 medRxiv, bioRxiv, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 18, 2020, in 55 accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses. We analyzed 56 pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by COVID-19 severity using a fixed or 57 random-effects model. 58 Results: In the meta-analysis of 37 studies, which included a total of 6,235 patients, 59 the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 36.4 IU/L in the severe 60 COVID-19 cases and 27.8 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61 −9.4 to −5.1, p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 62 46.8 IU/L in the severe cases and 30.4 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: −15.1 to 63 −10.4, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, regardless of disease severity, the AST level is often 64 higher than the ALT level. Compared with the non-severe cases, the severe cases 65 tended to have higher γ-glutamyltransferase levels but lower albumin levels. 66 Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we comprehensively described three patterns of 67 liver impairment related to COVID-19, namely hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and 68 hepatocellular disfunction, according to COVID-19 severity. Patients with abnormal 69 liver test results are at higher risk of progression to severe disease. Close monitoring 70 of liver chemistries provides an early warning against disease progression.

4 Lay Summary 74 Data on abnormal liver chemistries related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are 75 cumulating but are potentially confusing. We performed a meta-analysis of 37 studies 76 that included a total of 6,235 patients with COVID-19. We noted that patients with 77 abnormal liver test results are at higher risk of progression to severe disease and close 78 monitoring of liver chemistries provides early warning against disease progression.

Characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis 174 The selection process of the potential studies is depicted in Figure 1 Figure 2B ).
Significant heterogeneity was observed for the AST levels among the studies (I 2 = 193 68%, p < 0.01), which was slightly lower than that of the ALT levels (I 2 = 69%, p < 194 0.01). Potential publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot (Supplementary 195 Figure 2 ). In the patients with COVID-19, the mean AST level tended to be higher 196 All rights reserved.

Moreover, the gap 197 between the AST and ALT levels (46.8 and 36.5 IU/L, respectively) was even more Sixteen studies compared the mean ALB levels according to COVID-19 severity, 218 between 713 and 1,772 severe and non-severe cases, respectively ( Figure 5A) . A 219 significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I 2 = 61%, p < 0.01).

The patients with 236 COVID-19 often had higher AST levels than ALT levels, especially in severe cases. 237 We also observed a tendency of the severe cases to arise in the elderly.
Although the liver may act as the latent target of SARS-CoV-2, the actual prevalence 239 of abnormal liver chemistries could be underestimated because many studies did not (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
