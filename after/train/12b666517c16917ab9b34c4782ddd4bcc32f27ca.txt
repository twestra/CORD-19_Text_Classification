The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by an unprecedented amount of published scientific articles.
Objective: To assess the characteristics of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic.
Data sources: Articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza indexed in PubMed (Medline) during the first 3 months of these pandemics.
Any article published in the respective study periods that included any terminology related to COVID-19 or H1N1 in the title, abstract or full-text was eligible for inclusion. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded.
: Two operators conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. The article is reported following STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of primary and secondary articles. Prevalence of reporting of limitations in the abstracts. Results: Of the 2482 articles retrieved, 1165 were included. Approximately half of them were secondary articles (575, 49.4%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical
research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The second largest category was guidelines or guidance articles, All rights reserved.

Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations.
In a similar timeframe in 2009 there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic. As compared to that pandemic, during COVID-19 there were higher chances to publish reviews and guidance articles and lower chances to publish in vitro and animal research studies.
: As compared to the most recent pandemic, there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. However, the majority of the articles published do not add significant information, possibly diluting the original information published. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.
Past coronavirus outbreaks have led to prolific publishing on these health issues. 1 Similar surges in publication numbers were seen with earlier outbreaks of viral diseases like SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Swine Flu, which then dropped drastically when these diseases were contained. 1 The production of a large bulk of literature in the early phases of such outbreaks can create a severe burden for policy makers who need to make rapid evidence-based decisions for controlling the pandemic. They have to scrutinize large quantities of scientific publications to assess what original research has been published on this topic and appraise the quality of this research. It is especially important to identify articles that report novel information to articles that summarize or comment on existing information, ie primary vs secondary articles.
In this research study we have replicated this process and report on the characteristics of articles published in the first trimester of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients, health care professionals, policy makers, and the general public want to know what has been published on this health issue and what quality of research was available for decision making. Researchers, editors, peer reviewers, and publishing companies get an insight into the quantity and quality of articles to who's publication they contributed. The purpose of the present meta-epidemiological study is to identify the proportion of primary and secondary articles, to identify the proportion of studies that report limitations in their abstracts and to compare publishing patterns during COVID-19 and during the previous pandemic of the XI century, the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza.
We performed a cross-sectional study of articles published during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopted the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement 3 for reporting this study and included its checklist (Additional file 1). We implemented 1 change compared with our original protocol. We did not assess whether studies originated as multi center research projects, because this information could not be extracted reliably.
All articles retrieved on Medline through searching PubMed with the string "(COVID-19 OR COVID)" on April 2nd 2020 at 900pm Central Standard Time, after application of the filter 'Abstract', were eligible for inclusion in the study. The full search strategy is given in Additional file 2A. Any type of article published on COVID-19 was eligible. This implies that a broad spectrum of articles ranging from letters to the editors to randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Articles were eligible if they included any terminology related to SARS-CoV-2 (including but not limited to: SARS-CoV-2, COVID, COVID-19, novel coronavirus 2019), in the title, abstract or full-text. For example, in vitro articles in which other viruses (eg, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) were used as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2, were still eligible for inclusion in the study as soon as the authors mentioned SARS-CoV-2 or synonyms in the manuscript. No eligibility criteria were applied to specific participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, endpoints, language or settings of the articles. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded.
author', 'article type' (primary/secondary, defined below), 'study design' (defined below), 'number of patients included' (only for human medical research), 'presence of objective in the abstract', 'presence of limitation in the abstract', 'main conclusion' (Additional file 2B). Two operators (ND and RMR) conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. These procedures were pilot tested on 40 articles to calibrate both operators and to fine-tune the data extraction forms. Disagreements during the selection of articles and data extraction procedures were resolved through discussions between both operators. Consultation with a third operator in the case of persisting disagreements was not necessary.
We used a multi-step approach in order to classify each article included in the study. The overarching final classification was whether an article was primary, i.e., adding original scientific information to the literature, or secondary. Primary articles refer to original research studies and secondary articles refer to perspectives and syntheses of the available knowledge on COVID-19 such as, viewpoints, commentaries, guidelines, reviews etc. (Table 1) . Our classification of included articles was not exclusively based on the labels assigned to these articles, because study designs are often mislabeled by the authors themselves. 4 We therefore first assessed the validity of such labeling by evaluating the study design in the full-text, before making our final classifications of a study. Primary articles were divided in five categories, i.e., human medical research, in silico, in vitro, animal research and human non-medical research, and then in subcategories ( Table 1) . Many published articles included multiple analytical steps and could fall in several of these categories. For example, in a study samples could be obtained from several patientshuman medical researchthen transferred to a petri dish and cultured -All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Since the purpose of the present meta-epidemiological study is to define the amount of information accrued that is actually relevant for healthcare policy makers and clinicians, the categorization of the articles was performed considering the theoretical order of evidence provided by different study settings, i.e., human medical research>animal research>in vitro research>in silico research. Therefore, if a study could fit in multiple categories, we assigned the highest category based on that order. In the example above, it would have been 
We screened all abstracts to assess whether the objectives and the limitations of the article were reported or not. An abstract was defined as any type of information reported in the area for abstracts in PubMed. Objectives were defined as 'reported' when the abstract reported any type of statement that explained the purpose of the article. Limitations were defined as 'reported' when the abstract reported any type of statement that explained limitation(s) of the article.
Limitations were further subdivided in 'methodological limitation' and 'general limitation'; articles were classified as reporting a 'methodological limitation' when they stated in the abstract the presence of at least 1 limitation inherent to the article design (e.g., "due to the inclusion of a convenient sample this report is at risk of selection bias"); articles were classified as reporting a 'general limitation' when they stated in the abstract the presence of a limitation that was not All rights reserved.

We performed a search & extraction in an analogous way for articles published during the early phases of the H1N1 2009 pandemic. We performed a search on Medline through PubMed with the string "H1N1". We applied the filter regarding Text Availability "Abstract" and ordered the articles by date of publication. Our search strategy is reported in Additional file 2C. We extracted all the articles retrieved through the "Save" function on a .csv file. We established which was the first published article on the H1N1 2009 pandemic 5 based on a CDC summary. 6 We then included three full months of publications, ie from April 25 th 2009 to July 25 th 2009. Similar to articles related to COVID-19, articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported terminology related to "H1N1", "swine flu" or "the current pandemic", among others. From the articles included, we extracted country of origin, language of full-text, type of study and study design were extracted in a similar fashion as was done for the COVID-19 articles. The selection, extraction and classification of articles was performed independently by two operators (ND and RMR) and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
The primary outcomes of this meta-epidemiological study were:
-The proportion of primary articles over the total number of articles with an abstract published during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
-The proportion of articles reporting limitations in their abstracts. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Descriptive statistics are expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and ranges or absolute counts and percentages. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to explore the factors associated with the primary outcomes and provide odds ratio adjusted for confounders. Variables retained clinically significant were entered in the models regardless of their statistical significance. Goodness of fit was assessed with Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Nagelkerke R squared was used as a measure of predictive power. The first multivariable logistic regression had primary vs secondary articles as the dependent variable and included the country of publication (limited to the 11 countries with more publications), the language of full-text (English/Other languages), the number of authors, and the number of days from the start of the pandemic as predictor variables. The initial model had a significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P=0.004) and a low Nagelkerke R squared (0.27), due to non-linearities in the number of authors variable. The model was rebuilt after binning the variable (0 authors, 1-2 authors, 3-5 authors, 6-10 authors, >11 authors). The new model had a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P=0.14) and higher Nagelkerke R squared (0.33) and was retained. A univariable logistic regression model was built including COVID-19 articles vs H1N1 articles as the dependent variable and including article type as predictor variable.

The results of our search are presented in a flow diagram (Figure 1 ). Our search yielded 2482 articles. After exclusions of articles without an abstract, we retrieved 1215 articles. We excluded 50 articles based on the following rationale: duplicate articles (n=13), articles that were not on COVID-19 (13), articles without an English abstract (6), letter to previous papers (8), erratum
(2), local morbidity reports (7), and statement of the WHO (1). We included a total of 1165 articles on COVID-19 in the study.
Four countries contributed to three quarters (871, 74.8%) of the included articles, i.e., approximately half of these articles, (588, 50.5%) came from China, 168 articles (14.4%) from the United States, 77 articles (6.6%) from Italy, 38 articles (3.3%) from the United Kingdom.
The remaining 294 articles (25.2%) originated in decreasing numbers in Japan, Singapore, Korea, India, France, Germany, Taiwan, and other countries ( Table 2) . Of the secondary articles, the majority were reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Based on the multivariable logistic regression model, secondary articles were more likely to be published in a language different than English (aOR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.99 to 4.58), to be published at a later stage of the pandemic (aOR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.02), to include a lower number of authors (multiple aORs, Table 2 ), and to be published by authors from India, Italy, Singapore, Germany, and Taiwan (multiple aORs, reference: China; Table 2 ).

Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%). Ten abstracts reported methodological limitations, i.e., limitations related to the study design and the remaining 32 abstracts reported general limitations, such as the current lack of evidence on COVID-19, or the need for further studies on COVID-19. Limitations were reported in 5 out of 23 systematic reviews (21.7%) and 2 out of 20 human non-medical researches (10.0%). All other manuscript types had a frequency of reporting limitations between 0% and 3.8%.
Our search yielded 434 articles. After exclusions of articles without an abstract, we retrieved 239 articles. We excluded 16 articles that did not mention H1N1 or swine influenza in the full text.

Of the human medical research, 66 were observational studies and case series (92.9%), 3 were RCTs (4.2%), and 2 were single case reports (2.8%). The secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (38, 86.4%), with a few guidelines or guidance articles (5, 11.4%) and 1 systematic review (2.3%)( Table 3 ).
In the univariable logistic regression model, the odds of being published during COVID-19 were 8 times higher for guideline articles (OR: 8.1, 95% CI 3.2 to 20.3), and 2 times higher for reviews (OR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1), while the odds of being published during H1N1 were 24 times higher for animal researches (OR: 24.6, 10.5 to 57.6), and 6 times higher for in vitro research (OR: 6.1, 3.4 to 10.8) (Table 3; Figure 2 ).
This meta-epidemiological study is novel in having assessed the characteristics of scientific articles published during the initial three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study has five key findings. First, almost half (49.4%) of all 1165 included articles were secondary articles.
Perspectives and syntheses have an important role in scientific research, but one secondary article for each primary article could be redundant. Second, human medical research consisted of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The exponential growth of publications as was identified in this paper during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic was also identified in past viral outbreaks such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Swine Flu. 1 This high publication rate dropped dramatically upon containment of these diseases. Gori et al. 9 identified a high proportion of secondary literature in the first 30 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their findings cannot be directly compared with ours because they used different methods, had a much smaller sample size (234 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The strengths of this meta-epidemiological study are: (1) this is the first research study that assessed the characteristics of articles on COVID-19 listed in PubMed in the first three months since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (2) all study selection and data extraction procedures were conducted by two methodologists independently and all raw data were reported in additional files (3) the manuscript was reported according to the STROBE checklist. Having searched eligible articles exclusively in PubMed is a limitation, because this could have biased our outcomes. 10, 11 The total body of literature on COVID is expected to be larger.
The exponential surge in scientific publishing was expected with the outbreak of a pandemic of an unknown virus. Finding mostly observational studies among the human medical research studies in this body of articles was also not surprising. However, having to filter out half of the literature, because it is not producing new research data is problematic, especially when almost 2500 new articles on COVID-19 were indexed in PubMed in the first 3 months of this pandemic.
Researchers, peer reviewers, editors, and publishing companies are responsible for this large body of literature. They should aim at flattening the publication curve for example by tightening their acceptance criteria. This strategy could also help to improve the overall research quality. 12 Labeling publications as 'secondary article' in the abstract could become an initial obligatory item for all publications that do not produce original research.

Primary articles Human medical research Human medical research refers to articles reporting information on 1 or more human patient/s. In order to be classified as human medical research, an article would need to report individual patient data. Articles in this category were further subcategorized in 'randomized controlled trials (RCTs)', 'observational studies and case series', and 'case reports', based on the following key: articles including a single case were categorized 'case reports'; articles including 2 or more cases where no randomization were performed were categorized 'observational studies and case series'; articles including 2 or more cases where randomization of a treatment was performed were categorized 'RCTs'. We extracted the total number of patients included in human medical research studies.
In silico research Primary articles were classified as 'in silico research' if they reported the results of any type of computer-based research.
Articles in this category were further subcategorized in 'epidemiological modelling', 'biology/biochemistry/bioinformatics studies', and 'social media studies', based on the following key:
articles focusing on exploiting platforms or other online tools, such as Google trend in order to extrapolate information or generate any sort of prediction were categorized 'social media studies'; articles using published or original data to calculate the spreading or All rights reserved.
