The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 has caused severe life and economic damage worldwide, many countries are trapped by medical resource constraints or absence of targeted therapeutics, and therefore the implement of systemic policies to block this pandemic should be prioritized. Based on the transmission mechanisms and physicochemical properties of betacoronaviruses, we construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model (ICRD) to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement time and intensity of containment policies on the spread of epidemic. We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases. Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.
Introduction the ordinances concerning social distancing, quarantine and careful hand and respiratory hygiene, subsequently wearing personal protective equipments (PPE) (21) , isolating themselves at home, and recording their temperature each day. The communities adopted a comprehensive investigation strategy to detect the suspected cases and reported their trace while hiding their private information (22) resulting in a sub-exponential growth of the infected curve until a peak of 38,020 on Feb. 18th (23) . Despite there is a ethical controversy about whether suspicious persons should be mandatorily isolated from social networks, the experience from Wuhan supported that this policy had effectively cut the transmission channels of and compel the pandemic to a mitigation stage. In post-pandemic phase (24) , Wuhan continued to distribute disinfectors throughout the region including ventilation duct, water pipe, and urban sewers where COVID-19 was sampled in Paris (25) and the central China government stated the pandemic was basically blocked on Mar. 23th. Ultimately, after paying 4,632 deaths nationwide and incalculable economic cost, China has ended its 76-day lockdown of Wuhan, but the relative restrictions still remain in place.
The transmission dynamics observed in different continents and zones are markedly heterogeneous consulting time series data released by public health authorities (26) (27) (28) (29) . The fundamental reasons are that the fluctuation of the objective physical environments and the implementation intensity and duration of the containments policies restricted by public opinion, both presenting challenges to build the dynamic model to forecast the tendency of the pandemic. Furthermore, the CFI and recovery rate change as well with respect to different phases since the gradual enrichment of care experiences and capacities. Therefore, we design dynamical coefficients to quantify the variation of infectivity, investigation and isolation policies, vital dynamics to adjust the social response to the pandemic. Functionally, tuning the boundaries or the derived functions of the dynamical coefficients can subtly regulate the containment efforts and further observe their impact on the infected curves. We then simulate the results about advanc-3 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The results of our model introduce statistic evidences that the containment policies can effectively suppress or even block the outbreak of COVID-19 through mapping them into measurable interval coefficients to observe their influence on the epidemic.
From the cases and traces information of patients released by the Wuhan government and CD-C, most individuals were infected from a symptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection, especially during the period of exponential and sub-exponential growth, whereas the persons who were infected through asymptomatic or environmental transmission merely accounted for a negligible fraction of infected population. In practical, the boundaries of these four transmissions are ambiguous and the number of asymptomatic infections and secondary infections caused by them is difficult to count. Therefore, we generally assume that the non-isolated infected individuals are the main propagating sources on social networks. We divide the statues of the population into 5 categories: (H)ealthy, (I)nfected, (C)onfirmed, (R)ecovered and (D)ead (Fig. 1 ). More granular, the infected group I consists of the confirmed C and unconfirmed I − C and therein the confirmed individuals C are either isolated βC (β is the isolation rate) or non-isolated (1−β)C. The transmission dynamics of virus can be fully described by the ordinary differential equations (namely ICRD model) with respect to time t:
The infected but non-isolated group I − βC has the vital infectiousness since they not only are σ, κ, δ, µ are daily cure rate, incurable mortality rate, natural recovery rate, and non-treatment mortality rate, respectively. Hence ∂ t I quantifies the aggregate incremental cases of infection (Eq. (1)) after removing the recovered and dead population. Limiting to the objective medical testing ability of laboratories, only a fraction of η suspected cases could receive diagnosis within the unit statistical time (η is the algebraic mapping of investigation policy), so the increment of confirmed cases ∂ t C equals to the difference between the newly positive diagnosed cases η(I − C) and dead or recovered cases (σ + κ)C. Evently, we could deduce the daily increase of recovered or dead cases integrating the recovery ratio σ, δ and mortality κ, µ with the infected population (please see Materials and Methods for detailed derivation of Eqs. (1-4)).

The constant coefficients in Eq. (1-4) assume that the containment efforts or the physical and chemical characteristics of the coronavirus remain permanent in long-term transmission, and undoubtedly it is counterintuitive. In fact, the governments tend to adopt more compulsive policies as the dramatic increase of death cases, residents choose isolate themselves spontaneously with more publicity on negative news, and the testing and diagnosis techniques would be visibly improved after the deeply studying of the virus's properties. Hence the measures and intensity of the society to fight the pandemic change in different phases. For instance, initially, due to the lack of awareness of the virus, people are reluctant to maintain social distancing with others (R 0 and α are relatively large), so the virus has explosive infectivity at this stage. Subsequently, with the exponential increase of infected cases, the government would announce voluntary or compulsive isolation policies to reduce α until it remains low (Fig. 2a) . Furthermore, many susceptible patients cannot be diagnosed because of the limited medical resource in the preliminary stage. However, the promotion of the testing techniques and the enhancement of the investigation policies (η rises) would strongly reverse this situation in the successive stages. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic coefficients to simulate the transformation of propagation: determine the boundaries of α (or η) that catch intensity scope of the isolation (investigation) policies and b (or v) is a critic to evaluate the response time of these policies, both regulating 6 All rights reserved.

Statistic evidences for the power of comprehensive investigation and compulsive isolation policies Compared with the SEIR and S-ICRD, the dynamic coefficients based-ICRD model (D-ICRD) has infinitesimal mean square errors (MSE) with the data released by NHC (Fig. 4) . D-ICRD estimates that the existing infected and confirmed cases would dramatically raised to their peaks (41986, 38758) at Feb. 14th and 17th respectively (Fig 4A) , approximately consisting with the practical inflexion Feb. 18th (38020). In Phase 1, the incomplete investigation policies and limited testing techniques contribute the large interval between the infected and confirmed curves, whereas they gradually coincide with the strengthening of surveillance in phase 2. The truth-values of the recovered cases are always located in the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the curve predicted by D-ICRD but the estimated values are slight higher since the patients who are 7 All rights reserved.

We designed the dynamical coefficients associating with the implement time and intensity of the relative policies to simulate the transmission environment of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Compared with the static coefficients, the dynamical coefficients can more penetratingly capture the rational adjustment of social response to the severity of the epidemic. For example, many classical models assume the constant basic reproduction number but we believe that it changes with the intervention factors and eventually this change is mapped on the transmission coefficient α. Moreover, the improvement of therapy and the use of specific medicines would significantly affect the cure rate and mortality. Hereupon D-ICRD entirely reproduced the time series data released by NHC, and it balances robustness and agility.
Then, we subtly regulated the implement time or intensity of these interventional policies through changing the derived functions or boundaries of the corresponding dynamical coeffi-9 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We found that the infected and death cases would sharply decrease if the quarantine strategies could be promul- in Wuhan, before Feb. 20th). We suggest that the governments or communities should adopt the containments such as comprehensive investigating and tracking the temperature and traces information about the residents, immediately isolating the suspected and diagnosed infected individuals to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on social networks. Although such near-compulsory national policies may cause severe economic recession or ethical problems, we must realize that society is a community of life composed of all human beings, and we profoundly influence each other whereupon we should collaborate to fight this vital pandemic together. Given that there are no target therapeutics or vaccine currently, each of us should cooperate with these policies in a responsible manner, isolate ourselves from others, form an island, and ultimately prevent the spread of the virus.

The group of infected but non-isolated (blue and yellow nodes) is the main propagating source of virus through physical contacts (droplet), especially over the incubation period (30, 31) . The infected patients would die or produce antibodies without treatment but undoubtedly the herd immunity would take a long time to achieve and uncountable individuals would lose their lives in this process. Therefore, the diagnosed patients should be isolated from social networks to cut the transmission links (yellow edges). Furthermore, the red edges are more dangerous for the exposed persons and the comprehensive investigation policy for all people and the nucleic acid testing strategy for symptomatic patients should be taken to remove their connections with others. Meanwhile, some carrier would migrate to other place through the global transportation networks. The experiences from China demonstrated that the external input is the largest threat in the post-transmission period (32).
