The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine. Here, we present a self-amplifying RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a vaccine and demonstrate induction of robust neutralization of a pseudo-virus, proportional to quantity of specific IgG and of higher quantities than recovered COVID-19 patients. These data provide insight into the vaccine design and evaluation of immunogenicity to enable rapid translation to the clinic.
The unprecedented and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic, with the current estimated number of confirmed cases >2.2 million people, 1 has motivated the need for a rapidly producible and scalable vaccine. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses that cause disease pathology ranging from the common cold to pneumonia. 2, 3 Despite being listed on the WHO blueprint priority list, there are currently no licensed vaccines for SARS or MERS. 4 However, previous studies have elucidated the need to stabilize coronavirus spike proteins in their pre-fusion conformation in order to serve as a vaccine immunogen. 5 Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is a highly relevant platform for producing vaccines in the context of a global pandemic as it's possible to encode any antigen of interest 6, 7 and requires a minimal dose compared to messenger RNA (mRNA). 8 The first RNA therapeutic, which is formulated in LNP, was approved in 2018 and has set the precedent for clinical safety of LNP-formulated RNA. 9 Here, we compare the immunogenicity of saRNA encoding a pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in LNP in a preclinical murine model to the immune response generated by a natural infection in recovered COVID-19 patients. We characterize both the humoral and cellular response as well as the neutralization capacity of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus.
After confirming expression of the pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in vitro (Supplementary Figure 1) , mice were immunized with saRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in LNP with doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ g ( Figure 1a ).

After 6 weeks, we observed remarkably high quantities of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in mouse sera in a dose-responsive manner, ranging from 10 5 -10 6 ng/mL ( Figure   1b ). The groups that received doses of 10 and 1 μ g of saRNA LNP were significantly higher than the mice that received 10 μ g of electroporated pDNA, with p=0.0036 and 0.0020, respectively. All of the saRNA LNP-vaccinated mice, even the 0.01 μ g group, had higher quantities of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG compared to patients that had recovered from COVID-19, which had a mean titer of 10 3 ng/mL and a range of 10 1 -10 5 ng/mL. Importantly both the pDNA and saRNA LNP immunizations induced a Th1-biased response in mice (Supplementary We then sought to characterize how antibodies generated by immunization compared to those generated by a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection as far as capacity to neutralize a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus ( Figure 1c ). We observed highly efficient viral neutralization that varied in a linear dose-dependent manner for the mice vaccinated with saRNA LNP, with IC 50 values ranging from 5x10 3 to 10 5 . The groups that received 10 or 1 μ g of saRNA LNP were significantly higher than the electroporated pDNA positive control group, both with p<0.0001.

We also characterized the cellular response and induction of systemic cytokines in response to vaccination with saRNA LNP (Figure 2 ). We observed that splenocytes from vaccinated mice re-stimulated with a library of SARS-CoV-2 peptides yielded remarkably high IFN-ߛ secretion as quantified by ELISpot (Figure 2a ).

Here we characterized the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 saRNA LNP vaccine compared to the immune response of a natural infection in COVID-19 recovered patients. We observed that two saRNA LNP immunizations induced remarkably high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in mice, with quantities that were superior to both EP pDNA and natural infection in humans, that were able to efficiently neutralize a pseudotyped virus. We also observed that the saRNA LNP vaccine induces a robust cellular response, which is partially enabled by the potent LNP formulation.
We observed that the saRNA-encoded pre-fusion stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 used in these studies is highly immunogenic, yielding antibody titers >10 6 ng/mL (Figure 1 ), which is superior to what others have reported for subunit vaccines for the SARS, MERS and SARS-2 coronaviruses. 10 Furthermore, we observed higher antibody titers, viral neutralization (IC 50 ) and cellular response for LNP-formulated saRNA than electroporated pDNA, which we postulate is due to the potent LNP used in these studies, as previous comparisons between polyplex-formulated saRNA and EP pDNA have yielded similar immunogenicity. 8 This is highly useful for translation as it means a potent LNP-formulated saRNA vaccine can be injected with a widely accepted syringe and needle, and does not require electroporation instrumentation, which we envision will enable more widespread vaccination to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The saRNA LNP vaccine presented in these studies elicited robust antibody and cellular responses, with a Th1 bias that we hypothesize will enable immunogenicity in humans. Ongoing studies are being carried out to characterize the potential for antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 as has been observed for SARS and MERS, 11, 12 but the role of this phenomena in vaccine-induced immunity is not yet fully understood. Overall, we believe that these data inform the antigen design, formulation and preclinical evaluation of immunogenicity that will enable rapid translation of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to the clinic trials.

We used a plasmid vector to synthesize a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) replicon, based on a Trinidad donkey Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus strain (VEEV) alphavirus genome. The viral structural proteins driven from the sub-genomic promoter were replaced by the surface 'spike' glycoprotein of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): GenBank accession number: QHD43416.1 with some modifications. 13 The pre-fusion state of the spike glycoprotein was stabilized by proline substitutions of K968 and V969. We synthesized oligonucleotide fragments encoding the SARS-CoV-2 gene using GeneArt strings (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assembled into the plasmid vector with NEB HiFi assembly (New England BioLabs).
