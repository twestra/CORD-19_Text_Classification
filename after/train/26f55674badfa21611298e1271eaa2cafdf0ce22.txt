Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19. were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral, antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion.
As of March 26, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449) articles. Forty-one studies were included, of which clinical trials (n=3), (case reports n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirtysix studies were conducted in China (88%).
The most common mentioned and reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and oseltamivir (n=16).
A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed full articles in English published from December 1 st , 2019 to March 26 th , 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, chloroquine, convalescent plasma, antiviral, antibacterial, oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine phosphate, monoclonal antibodies. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion; however, these were likely to be quantitative and RCT articles. The focus of the review was of therapeutics use for the management of COVID-19 patients. Primary outcomes were:
(1) the evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice, since this emergence of the outbreak irrespective of patient characteristics, setting and outcome measures, and to discuss the most common reported medicines in this review.
(2) the clinical outcome of the therapeutic treatment (Recovery, Mortality) in COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes were adverse events associated with the treatment.
Duplicate articles were removed. Titles were independently screened by both reviewers with abstracts followed by full articles reviewed where any doubt remained. Inclusions and exclusions were recorded following PRISMA guidelines presented in the form of a PRISMA Flow Diagram and detailed reasons recorded for exclusion. Critical appraisal checklists appropriate to each study design were to be applied and checked by a second team member. Any bias or quality issues identified were to be considered prior to a quantitative meta-analysis and meta-narrative, CAPS Appraisal Checklists tools were used for quality assessments. A data extraction tool was designed to capture focus of interest, population, geographical location, methodology, specific mention of therapeutic treatment and adverse events, key findings and further research. Ethical review was not required for this review of existing peer reviewed literature.
As of March 26, 2020, the initial manuscripts identified (n=449) articles. Inclusions and exclusions are reported following PRISMA guidelines presented in the form of a PRISMA Flow Diagram (Figure 1 ) with reasons for exclusion recorded (Table 2) as follows: duplicates removed (n=213), records after duplicates removed (n=236), records excluded (n=28) of which n=18 excluded because of the language (n=9 Chinese, n=2 Dutch, n=1 Vietnamese, n=1Spanish, n=1 Italian, n=1 Russian, n=1 Portuguese, n=1 Iranian and n=1 German), ten for other reasons including incomplete and irrelevant articles.
Consensus on final inclusions (n=41) studies and negotiated without the need for a third reviewer is presented in Table 3 .
Forty-one studies were included, of which clinical trials (n=3), (case reports n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies.
Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%), Korea (n=1), USA n=1, France n=1, Singapore n=1, Macau n=1.
Total Number of patients reported in this study were 8806: males (n=2111, 24%), females (n=3638, 41.3), other (n=2995, 34%), unspecified (n=62, 0.3%).
The mean of age was 50.8 years in 39 studies; the age was not specified in three studies.
The most common reported medicine in this systematic review was the anti-inflammatory medication corticosteroid (n=25) with different names and product characteristics, (corticosteroid n=21, methylprednisolone n=3, dexamethasone n=1), followed by the antiviral HIV medication Lopinavir (n=21), as combination lopinavir / ritonavir (n=18), alone (n-3), followed by the oseltamivir (n=16) and arbidol hydrochloride (n=8).
In terms of antibacterial medicines, moxifloxacin (n=4) and tigecycline were the most reported.
Convalescent plasma therapy was reported in one multi center retrospective observational study in (n=6) patients.
The outcome of the therapeutics given varies between patients' discharge and recovery, ongoing hospitalization, and mortality. Available data concerning this issue is shown in Table 3 .
This is the first up to date review related the therapeutics used in COVID-patients in a systematic manner. As of March, twenty-sixth, 2020 and since the emergence of COVID-19, only forty-one research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included in the current systematic review ( 2, 5, , of which only three were clinical trials; most were either case reports, case series or prospective and retrospective observational studies. Systematic corticosteroid of different names and formulation was the most commonly mentioned, and used medication (n=25), followed by the antivirals Lopinavir (n=21), oseltamivir (n=16) and arbidol hydrochloride (n=8). The Convalescent plasma therapy was mentioned in one multi-center retrospective observational study and was administered to six patients.
Abidol hydrochloride was the fourth most mentioned medicine in this review; it is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, and other types of viruses including hepatitis C virus. It is used in Russia and China, yet not approved for use in other countries (52) . However, no conclusive evidence of its efficacy for COVID-19 was reported. In this review, it was reported together with favipiravir, which was approved recently for treatment of novel influenza on February 15, 2020 in China (52) .
Chloroquine phosphate and Hydroxychloroquine were reported in this review and showed favorable outcomes on the recovery of COVID-19 patients (6) (7) (57) (58) (59) (60) . The mechanism of action on viruses for these two medicines is probably the same effect. Chloroquine has been used for a long time to treat malaria and showed positive outcomes on patients. Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine showed a significant effectiveness to kill intracellar pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever (22) . The French open label non-randomized clinical trial was promising and the first clinical trial of these medication on COVID-19 patients. The effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significant because it showed reduction in the viral load when it compared with the control group (22) . Moreover, the effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective when azithromycin was added to the patients according to their clinical needs. However, clinical follow-up and occurrence of adverse effects were not discussed in the paper; further work should be done on these medicines to reduce the spread of . Although these two medicines have shown promising activity against SARSCoV-2, there is a risk of arrhythmia associated with their requiring caution for use at higher cumulative dosages. Therefore, it is recommended that their use in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 is to be restricted to hospitalized patients. On March 30, 2020, has issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with .
Convalescent plasma treatment was mention once in this review, in a multi-center cohort research of 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in Wuhan. The findings showed that convalescent plasma was administered to six patients and no transfusion reactions occurred; however, the study could not provide adequate information about the efficacy of convalescent plasma, due to limited sample sizes and lack of randomized controlled group (61) (62) .
In fact, convalescent plasma therapy could be a promising method of treatment for COVID-19 patients, in a very recent study conducted in China (case series), showed that five critically ill patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who had acute respiratory distress syndrome; their body temperature was normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients after receiving plasma transfusion of recovered COVID-19 patients, their viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion; 3 out of 5 patients, were discharged from the hospital and were in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion (63) .
On March 24, 2020 the US FDA has approved convalescent plasma treatment for investigational use under the traditional Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) regulatory pathway, and for eligible patients who have confirmed COVID-19 and severe or immediately life-threatening conditions such as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure (64) (65) .
Notably there are some potential risks and ethical issues associated with their used, including increased thrombotic event risk that occur at the same administration date (0.04 to 14.9%), the lack of high quality research in this particular area, and the selectivity of donors with high neutralizing antibody titers (65) .
This is the first systematic review up to date, related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only 41 research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China, of which only three were clinical trials.
The anti-inflammatory medication corticosteroid was found to be the most mentioned and used medicine in these studies, despite the safety alert made by WHO and CDC, followed by antivirals medication Lopinavir, oseltamivir and arbidol hydrochloride.
Although further research is warranted as the amount of the evidence increases, but with the limited available data, this study presents the current picture of treatment modalities used for COVID-19. Propelling developments in treatment of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.
