Background 24 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public 25 health. Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to 26 correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of 27 these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical 28 manifestations in patients.
Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were 32 screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization 33 assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, 34 and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2- 35 specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may 53 raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of 54 NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the 55 interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be 56 further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. 57 Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for 58 prevention or treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 has spread 69 around the world and become a global pandemic. 1 The etiological agent of COVID-19 70 was identified as a SARS-related coronavirus designated as SARS-COV-2 71 coronavirus. 2,3 As of March 27, 2020, it had caused a total of 509,164 cases of infection 72 and resulted in 23,335 deaths worldwide. 1 About 81% of infected patients showed only 73 mild symptoms, but 14% of them had severe symptoms such as dyspnea, high 74 respiratory frequency and low blood oxygen saturation. Another 5% of patients, 75 especially those over 60, or with comorbidities, progressed to critical condition. About Here, we used a pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay to measure 98 SARS-Cov-2-specific NAbs in plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with mild 99 symptoms. The pseudovirus (PsV) neutralization assay is a sensitive and reproducible 100 assay. It does not produce any highly pathogenic virus, and it can be safely handled in 101 a biosafety level 2 facility. Herein, we aimed to explore the clinical characteristics the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Plasma with high titers of NAbs showed 185 higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, and S2-specific binding antibodies ( Figure 1B ). 186 Moreover, plasma from these patients also showed cross-binding to SRAS-CoV RBD 187 and S1 regions ( Figure 1C ), but the binding to SARS-CoV S protein was not consistent We observed that NAb titers were variable in the plasma of 175 recovered patients.
ID50s ranged from below detection limit (<40) to 21567 ( Figure 3A ). About 30% of 224 recovered patients generated a very low level of NAb titers (ID50: < 500) ( Figure 3A , 225 All rights reserved.

About 17%, 39%, and 14% showed medium-low 228 (ID50: 500-999), medium-high (ID50: 1000-2500), and high (ID50: > 2500) NAb titers, 229 respectively ( Figure 3B ). We also collected and measured the levels of NAbs in plasma 230 from 47 of the 175 patients during the follow-up examination two weeks after discharge.
As shown in Figure 3C 242 We observed that elderly patients were more likely to induce higher titers of NAbs than 243 younger patients. As shown in Figure 4A , the patients were divided into three groups the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, none of the patient progressed into severe conditions, and 267 no significant difference was observed between age and length of hospital stay among 268 these patients ( Figure 4D ). Interestingly, we observed that the NAb titers negatively 269 correlated with blood lymphocyte counts (r= -0.44, p<0.0001, Figure 5B left) and 270 positively correlated with blood CRP levels (r= 0.5, p<0.0001, Figure 5B It is also noteworthy that the levels of NAbs in patients were variable. About 30% of 299 patients failed to develop high titers of NAbs after COVID-19 infection. However, the 300 disease duration of these patients compared to others was similar. Notably, there were 301 ten recovered patients whose NAb titers were very low, under the detectable level of the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The NAbs titers in patients were also observed to be correlated with the age of the 308 patients. Elderly patients had significantly higher titers of NAbs than younger patients. antibody therapy, an easy task that can be performed using the PsV neutralization assay.
Correlation of NAbs titers with the age, lymphocyte counts and blood CRP levels of 336 patients also lays the groundwork for further study to explore the mechanism of NAbs 337 development in COVID-19 patients. 340 We declare no competing interests. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
