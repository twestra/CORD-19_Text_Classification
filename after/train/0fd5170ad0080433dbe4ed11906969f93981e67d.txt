COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. One Sentence Summary: M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. : bioRxiv preprint COVID-19 model, two families including 3 species of non-human primates, which are widely used for animal models with their own advantages and disadvantages, were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, followed by comparisons of clinical symptoms, hematology, biochemical indexes, immunology and histopathology among 3 species. We found that both Macaca mulatta (M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) of old world monkeys were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, although M. mulatta was more susceptible to viral infection than M. fascicularis. However, : bioRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, as the model of COVID-19, M. mulatta and M. fascicularis may be chosen for further exploration of viral pathogenesis, evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines.
Given that host factors may be involved in viral pathogenesis, we designed an experiment in the present study to investigate whether host genetics, age and gender affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates (Figure 1 ). Two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 M. mulatta, 6 M. fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 C. jacchus), were chosen for this experiment after screening and randomly grouped based on species, age and gender ( Figure 1 ). Animals in large size (4 adults and 4 old M. mulatta, 6 M. fascicularis) were inoculated with 4.75x10 6 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 via 3 routines (intratreachuslly 4.0ml, intranasally 0.5ml and intra 0.25ml). Half dosage of the viruses was given to 4 young M. mulatta via the same 3 routines. 6 C. jacchus were inoculated with 1.0x10 6 pfu intranasally.
Animals were monitored daily and sampled at the indicated time points before and after viral inoculation (Figure 1 ). Increased body temperature (BT) (above 38 ℃) was continuously observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. BT of 7/12 M. mulatta reached the first peak on day 4-6 post inoculation (dpi) and maintained above 38 ℃ for several days. The highest BT was 40.9 ℃ during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of M. fascicularis, their BT didn't change as much as those of M. mulatta. And duration of BT>38 ℃ in M. fascicularis was shorter than M. mulatta (Figure 2A ).
On 0 and 10 dpi, body weight (BW) of experimental animals (C. jacchus not determined) was checked on electronic balance. As compared to BW on day 0, nine out of 12 M. mulatta showed the decreased BW with declined range of 5.88%-28.57%. Eighty-three percent (5/6) of M. fascicularis lost BW by 2.
The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, was firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei China in December 2019 1 . About one month, this severe disease attracted international attentions and declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. Within 4 months, COVID-19 unexpectedly spread to 195 countries and regions, led to more than 1 million confirmed cases in the world and was defined as a pandemic disease. It is believed to be the second largest infectious disease since 1918 flu 2 . Clinicians and scientists have been globally collaborating to investigate this disease and its pathogen, such as diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 3 , genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2 4 . However, there are still many critical questions remaining, which are hard to be answered in clinic studies. For example, how do SARS-CoV-2 transmit?
What is viral pathogenesis? What about vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2? Therefore, animal models are urgently expected to be established for this severe COVID-19. Although several models of COVID-19 have recently been reported [5] [6] [7] , including the non-human primate model, none of model should be considered to be the best one, depending on what questions we are going to answer with the animal models. About 16 years ago, the nonhuman primate models recapitulated several important aspects of SARS [8] [9] [10] [11] .
These models made great contributions to investigation of SARS pathogenesis, evaluation of antiviral drugs and vaccine 12 . Though COVID-19 is different from SARS in some aspects, pathogens for these two diseases share some characters, such as ACE2 receptor. Here, to establish the Chest radiographs of infected animals (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, not C. jacchus due to their small size) were recorded every other day post virus inoculation. From the beginning of 10 dpi, abnormalities at various degrees appeared in lungs of all M. mulatta and M. fascicularis. The texture of the two lungs is increased and thickened, and scattered in small patches ( Figure 2B ).
Overview of the chest radiograph throughout this study showed that progressive pulmonary infiltration was noted in all M. mulatta and M. fascicularis (Supplemental Figure 1 ).
To know dynamics of viral replication and virus shedding, samples of nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs, feces, blood and tissues were collected at the indicated time points, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes were quantitated by RT-qPCR. Swab samples collected on 2 dpi from M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed surprisingly high levels of viral genome RNA, particularly in nasal swabs. Most of swab samples saw the second peaks of viral RNA on 6-8 dpi.
In some swab samples from old world monkeys, viral RNA was still detectable on 14 dpi ( Figure 3A ). Less viral RNA were detected in throat swabs, compared to nasal swabs and anal swabs. In contrast to M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis, lower levels of viral RNA were detected in swab samples from C. jacchus during two weeks post viral inoculation ( Figure 3B ). Virus shedding in feces from 8 out of 18 old world monkeys started on 6 dpi. Notably, higher levels of viral RNA were detected in feces from SXH6, HHH6, HHH11 and HHH12, from which anal swabs also gave correspondingly higher number of viral RNA. In peripheral blood, 8/18 old world monkeys and 6/6 new world monkeys had viral RNA detectable on 2 dpi. After 6 days, blood samples from nearly all old world monkeys became viral RNA-positive. On 10 dpi, viral RNA was not detectable in blood samples from almost all (23/24) of experimental monkeys ( Figure 3A ). Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in tissue samples from 8 animals necropsied on 4 dpi (HHH13), 7 dpi (HHH14), 12 dpi (HHH8), 13 dpi (SXH-1, RH2, RH5) and 15 dpi (HHH3, HHH12).

No viral RNA was detected from all tissues of two C. jacchus.
We could detect higher level of viral genomes in the tissue of bronchus and weasand from 3 necropsied M. mulatta and relatively lower level of viral RNA in one M. fascicularis. Spleens from HHH12 and SXH1 gave middle levels of viral RNA. No viral RNA was detected in other tissues. Furthermore, viral RNA and spike protein in tissue samples were confirmed in lung, trachea and bronchus by RNA hybridization RNAscope and immunofluorescent assay ( Figure 3D and Figure 3E ). Under TEM, no viral particle was observed in the ultrathin sections of lungs and other tissues.
To determine the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we firstly The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031807 doi: bioRxiv preprint liver functions, heart/muscle functions, kidney functions, blood lipids, humoral immune responses, and stresses (data not shown). Unfortunately, we could not find any biochemistry index that could be a biomarker of SARS-CoV-2 infection correlated with functions of key organs.
Humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated in viral S protein-coated ELISA plates. Virus-specific antibodies became detectable as early as 4 dpi in both species of old world monkeys. In the following week, some animals showed a peak level of virus-specific antibodies. In the other animals, antibody levels gradually increased until the end of experiment The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031807 doi: bioRxiv preprint fracture of some mitochondrial ridges) ( Figure 5C ), which was consistent to the results from microscopic inspection.
SARS-CoV-2, recently reported as another novel coronavirus escaping from Pandora's box after16 years 13 , leaves us not just many mysteries but also hopes in its jar. Animal models of COVID-19, particularly non-human primate models, will give us hopes to uncover many mysteries of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Since December of 2019, scientists all over the world have been working to establish animal model of COVID-19. So far there are several models reported in preprinted journals or peer-reviewed published journals, including two small murine models (hACE2 transgenic mouse 14 and Gold Syrian hamster 15 ), one ferret model 16 Retrospective studies of clinical features of COVID-19 show that older patients have more severe diseases, which may be associated with comorbidities, including tumor, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart diseases and so on [18] [19] [20] . These underlying diseases may make senior patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsen COVID-19.
However, animals in this study were screened prior to experiments and supposed to be no severe complications/comorbidities and relatively healthy with normal immunity. This may explain that no matter age and gender within one species, monkeys showed similar susceptibility and responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Monitoring body temperature is one of critical steps to define COVID-19 suspected patients, which leads to the conclusion that fever is the most common in COVID-19 patients, counting for more than 85% of all inpatients 3, 18, 21 . Here, all SARS-CoV-2 inoculated M. mulatta had increased body temperature at some time points with a peak of 40.9 ℃. One-third of M. fascicularis and C. jacchus had a slightly elevated body temperature.
Nevertheless, this manifestation could not be defined as fever since we don't have the physiological body temperature of various species of monkeys as a reference.
The other important clinical feature of COVID-19 is abnormal changes of chest radiograph from X-ray and CT 22 , which is generally considered to be direct evidence for pneumonia. Ground glass opacities (GGO) were seen in 40%-70-89.6% of COVID-19 patients, followed by consolidation (13-33.9%) and other abnormal radiographs 18, 21, 23, 24 . In this study, all animals (C. jacchus The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031807 doi: bioRxiv preprint negative in lung after 10 dpi, but was still detectable in weasand, and bronchus. It is possible that inflammatory environment of lung may push viruses out to other tissues.
Appearance of viral RNA in blood, out of lung, correlated with the severity COVID-19 33 . We could detect viral RNA in blood samples from all of 24 monkeys, although there were some differences of viral load and lasting time among individual animals. However, we couldn't find the correlation between blood viral RNA and severity of disease. 
Viral stock of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the Center of Diseases Control, Guangdong Province China. Viruses were amplified on Vero-E6 cells and concentrated by ultrafilter system via 300kDa module (Millipore). Amplified SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed via RT-PCR, sequencing and transmission electronic microscopy, and titrated via plaque assay (10 6 pfu/ml).
Three species of monkeys from two families of primates (old world monkeys and new world monkey) were used for this study. Detailed information about experimental animals was shown in Figure 1A .
Animal groups and experimental schedules were outlined in Figure 1A .
Referring to the NHP model of SARS, we inoculated old world monkeys with total 4.75ml of 10 6 pfu/ml SARS-CoV-2 intratracheally (4ml), intranasally (0.5ml) and on conjunctiva (0.25ml), new world monkeys with 1.0ml intranasally. Animals were daily checked for clinical sign and body temperature.

For paraffin-bedded sections, tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutralbuffered formalin, embedded in paraffin. 5 um sections were prepared for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, RNAscope or immunofluorescent staining. The whole H&E slide was scanned via 3D HISTECH system, evaluated by a pathologist double-blindly.
For ultrastructural sections, tissues were successively fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide solution. After gradual dehydration in various concentrations of ethanol, tissues were embedded in epoxy resin and cut into 60-70nm sections. After stained with 2% uranium acetate, ultrathin sections were examined under Hitachi transmission electron microscope H-7650.

FFPE slides were pretreated by baking, de-paraffinizing, target retrieval and protease treatment. SARS-CoV-2 specific probe was applied to the pretreated slides and hybridized with viral genome. Fluorophore was added to detect the hybridization on slides, followed by counter-staining with DAPI. Slides were scanned via 3D HISTECH system for further analysis.
