Background. COVID-19 is a pandemic with no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines. The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging.
A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. The presence of neutralizing antibody was determined with a modified cytopathogenic assay based on live SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different with different clinical characteristics were analyzed.
Results. The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), and the antibody level was highest during day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. Individual differences in changes of antibody levels were observed among 8 representative convalescent patients. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-60 and 61-84 had a higher antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (β=1.0518, P=0.0152; β =1.3718, P=0.0020). Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher antibody titer (β=0.4639, P=0.0227).
Conclusions. The neutralizing antibodies were detected even at the early stage of disease, and a significant response showed in convalescent patients. Moreover, changes on antibody levels ware individual specific.
The family Coronaviridae is comprised of large, enveloped, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses that can infect a wide range of animals and human [1] . Two coronavirus pandemics in human have emerged in the past two decades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was first recognized in 2003, causing a global outbreak [2] . It was followed by another pandemic event in 2012 designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3] . In December 2019, emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide, and the World white blood cell count were obtained.
The indicators for immunogenicity assessment included seropositivity rate and determination of the geometric mean titer (GMT). The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated by Reed-Muench method on day 5. A titer of 1:4 or higher indicated seropositivity. For calculation of GMT, antibody titers of <1:8, >1:512, and >1:1024 were assigned values of 1:4, 1:(512+512/2), and 1:(1024+1024/2), respectively.
The presence of neutralizing antibody was determined with a modified cytopathogenic assay.
Serum samples were inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted with cell culture medium in two-fold steps. The diluted serums were mixed with a virus suspension of 100 CCID50 in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1, followed by 2 hours incubation at 36.5°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.
1-2 X104 Vero cells were then added to the serum-virus mixture, and the plates were incubated for 5 days at 36.5°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of each well was recorded under microscopes, and the neutralizing titer was calculated by the dilution number of 50% protective condition.

Of the 70 patients enrolled into this study, 58 were recovered and discharged from hospital ( Table   1 ). The mean age of the patients was 45.1 years (range 16.0-84.0). A total of 58.6% were female.
Among them, 38 (54.2%) patients were residents or travelled in Wuhan, Hubei. The number of patients having history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension was 2 (2.8%), 5 (7.1%) and 9 (12.9%), respectively. One (1.4%) patient was asymptomatic infected, 22 (31.4%) had mild clinical manifestations, 43 (61.5%) were moderate, and the remaining 4 (5.7%) were in severe condition (1 was inpatients and 3 were convalescent patients). Circulating C-reactive protein for inpatients and convalescent patients were 7.5 and 17. 
The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% for 117 blood samples at different stages of illness.
The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), of which 52.1% (61/117) had a titer between 1:64 and 1:512 (Table 2) .
We analyzed the changes on antibody levels according to the time course since onset ( Table 2 ).
The antibody levels according to different time course since onset were significantly different (P=0.0012). The GMT of day 31-40 since onset (1: 271.2, 95% CI, 175.8 to 418.5) reached the highest, and decreased slightly after that time period. Univariate GEE analysis showed that the antibody level during day 31-40 was significantly higher than other phases (Table 4 ). However, multivariate GEE analysis showed that the antibody level during day 31-40 was only higher than All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Due to the COVID-19 widely spreading around the world, the specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are urgently needed. We analyzed the neutralizing antibody levels among different classification patient with increased days since onset of symptoms, the results indicated that a significant neutralizing antibody response was observed in convalescent patients, moreover, there were individual differences in changes of antibody levels.
In the study, typical antibody responses to live viral infection were seen induced in all COVID-19 patients regardless the stage of the disease. Moreover, the immunity levels were already strong enough even at the early stage of illness, with seropositivity rate reaching up to 100.0% at day 10.
The GMT reached the peak at day 31-40 after onset of symptoms. Even though the GMT had a slightly decreased at day 41-53, the seropositivity rate remained 100.0%. However, the results were different from other study which indicated the titers of antibodies reached their peak at 10 to 15 days after disease onset [12] . After adjusting cofounding factors, multivariate GEE analysis demonstrated that the antibody levels were comparable between day 31-40 and day 41-53 since disease onset. However, the proportion with a titer of 1:512 or above decreased from 52.8% during day 31-40 to 27.6% during day 41-53. Due to the lack of blood samples collected from patients in the later stages of illness, whether and when seropositivity rate declined below 100.0% remained unknown. How long any immunity in patients will last is a key and big unknown problem for safe and effect antiviral treatments and vaccines in the future [13] . For other coronaviruses, immunity after an infection was strong for several months, but then began to wane [14] . Chang [15] indicated that peak IgG titers in all SARS-CoV patients appeared at 1 month or 1 to 3 months after the disease onset, and a drop (4.4-fold on average) in IgG titers was evident between 1 month and 6 months after onset. These studies suggested that it's worthy of further study to analyze antibodies after COVID-19 patients recovered for a longer time.
