Abstract: Hearing and balance deficits have been reported during and following treatment 28 with the antimalarial drug chloroquine. However, experimental work examining the direct 29 actions of chloroquine on mechanoreceptive hair cells in common experimental models is 30 lacking. This study examines the effects of chloroquine on hair cells using two common 31 experimental models: the zebrafish lateral line and neonatal mouse cochlear cultures. 32
Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or 33 hydroxychloroquine for 1 hr or 24 hr, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. A 34 significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen 35 across conditions for both exposure periods. Hydroxycholroquine showed similar toxicity. 36
In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue 37 from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents. These 38 findings suggest a need for future studies employing hearing and balance monitoring 39 during exposure to chloroquine and related compounds, particularly with interest in these 40 compounds as therapeutics against viral infections including coronavirus. 41 42 author/funder.

Hair 163 cell survival was then related to concentration of chloroquine used in incubation. As hydroxychloroquine is often used to replace chloroquine in clinical settings, 183 these two drugs were compared for relative hair cell toxicity. Both drugs showed dose-184 dependent hair cell loss ( Figure 2 ). Hydroxychloroquine showed slightly more toxicity than 185 chloroquine (F=4.774, p=0.03; two-way ANOVA). These results demonstrate that both 186 clinically-relevant chloroquine drugs show hair cell toxicity in the zebrafish model. 187
Previous work has demonstrated that quinoline drugs, including chloroquine, can 188 inhibit aminoglycoside ototoxicity by partially blocking mechanotransduction-dependent 189 toxin uptake (Ou et al., 2012) . We reasoned that the asymptotic nature of the chloroquine 190 dose-response function might be due to its ability to block its own uptake. We performed 191 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Function of the mechanotransduction channel 192 was assessed through quantification of FM1-43X uptake after pre-treatment with 193 chloroquine at doses that cause maximal hair cell death. Fish were also treated with 194 benzamil, a MET channel blocker known to block drug uptake ( implying that chloroquine uptake is rapid and affects hair cells soon after they are exposed.

Exposed animals displayed minimal damage in the vestibular system, and impacted 252 vestibular function recovered with time. Peripheral auditory function was reduced with 253 quinine injections-acutely exposed animals improved fully or partially, and those receiving 254 chronic dosing remained affected. 255
The mechanism by which chloroquine acts to kill hair cells is not yet known. The 256 pharmacological mechanisms of action of chloroquine are subject of some controversy but 257 is widely considered to be due to its accumulation in lysosomes and subsequent 258 Moreover we found that interfering with mechanotransduction had little effect on 279 chloroquine toxicity. We suggest that there may be other reasons for incomplete toxicity in 280 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
