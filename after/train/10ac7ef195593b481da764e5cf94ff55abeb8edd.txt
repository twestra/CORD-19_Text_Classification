COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that threatens millions of people worldwide.
There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing this disease. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors. author/funder.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that cause severe infections in respiratory, hepatic and various organs in humans and many other animals [1, 2] . Within the 20 years of the 21st century, there are already three outbreaks of CoV-causing global epidemics, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The newly emerged CoV infectious disease (COVID-19) already caused more than 1.5 million confirmed infections and 89 thousands deaths worldwide up to April 9, 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
There is an urgent call for drug and vaccine research and development against COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to be caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), whose genome was sequenced in early January 2020 [3, 4] . The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV with 79.6% sequence identity [5] and remain stable up to now [6] . However, the sequence identities vary significantly for different viral proteins [7] . For instance, the spike proteins (S-protein) in CoVs are diverse in sequences and even in the host receptors that bind due to the rapid mutations and recombination [8] . Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site, their binding affinities to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations [9] . On the contrary, the 3Clike proteases (3CL pro ) in CoVs are highly conserved. The 3CL pro in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a sequence identity of 96.1 %, making it an ideal target for broad author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Although many inhibitors have been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro [10] [11] [12] [13] , unfortunately none of them has entered into clinical trial. Inspired by the previous studies, several covalent inhibitors were experimentally identified to inhibit the 3CL pro activity and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, and some of the complex crystal structures were solved [14, 15] . In addition, a number of clinically used HIV and HCV protease inhibitors have been proposed as possible cure for COVID-19 [16] and some of them are now processed to clinically trials [17] . Several computational studies proposed potential SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors by virtual screening against the crystal or modeled three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro as well as machine intelligence [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Highly potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors with diverse chemical structures need further exploration.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs and formulae have long been used in treating viral diseases. Some of them have been clinically tested to treat COVID-19 [24] . anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities have been reported [27] . Remarkably, the extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum anti-viral activities, author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In addition, a multicenter, retrospective analysis demonstrated that S. baicaleinsis exhibits more potent antiviral effects and higher clinical efficacy than ribavirin for the treatment of hand, foot and mouth disease [32] . Several S. baicalensis derived mixtures or pure compounds have been approved as antiviral drugs, such as Baicalein capsule (to treat hepatitis) and
Huangqin tablet (to treat upper respiratory infection) in China. Most of the S. baicaleinsis ingredients are flavonoids [33] . Flavonoids from other plants were also reported to mildly inhibit SARS and MERS-CoV 3CL pro [34, 35] . Here we studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredients. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity and the most active ingredient baicalein exhibits an IC50 of 0.39 M. In addition, the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis effectively inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell assay. We also identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity at microM concentration.
We prepared the 70% ethanol extract of S. baicalensis and tested its inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We expressed SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and performed activity assay using a peptide substrate (Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA) according to the published procedure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro assay [11, 36] .

The crude extract exhibits significant inhibitory effect with an IC50 of 8.5 g/ml, suggesting that S. baicalensis contains candidate inhibitory ingredients against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . 
We tested the inhibitory activity of four major ingredients from S. baicalensis: baicalein, baicalin, wogonin and wogonoside in vitro. Baicalein showed the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ). Baicalin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity for about 41% at 50 μM, while wogonin and wogonoside were not active at this concentration.

In the docking model, baicalein binds well in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with its 6-OH and 7-OH forming hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl group of L141 and the backbone amide group of G143, respectively ( Figure 2A ). In addition, the carbonyl group of baicalein is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide group of E166. The catalytic residues H41 and C145 are well covered by baicalein, accounting for its inhibitory effect. As the 7-OH in baicalin is in close contact with the protein, there may not be enough space for glycosyl modification, explaining the low activity of baicalin. As for wogonin, the absence of 6-OH together author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Hydrogen bond is observed between its 5-OH and the backbone carbonyl group of L141, while the interaction with E166 by its 8-methoxy group is weaker than that formed by the carbonyl group in baicalein.

Baicalein inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV2 with an EC50 of about 17.6 M and SI > 2.8 ( Figure 3B ). The high activity of S. baicalensis crude extract in the antiviral assay implies it may also interact with other viral or host targets in addition to SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibition, which can be further explored in the future. 
We searched for baicalein analogues from available flavonoid suppliers and selected 8 flavonoids and 2 glycosides for experimental testing. Four flavonoid compounds were found to be potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors. Among them, scutellarein is mainly distributed in genus Scutellaria and Erigerontis herba (Dengzhanxixin or Dengzhanhua in Chinese) in its glucuronide form, scutellarin. Scutellarin has long been used in cardiovascular disease treatment for its ability to improve cerebral blood supply [37] . For all the active flavonoid compounds that we found, the introduction of glycosyl group, as in the case of baicalein and baicalin, decreased the inhibition activity, probably due to the steric hindrance of the glycosyl group, which is also true for scutellarein/scutellarin, and myricetin/myricetrin.

We suggest that these compounds can be further optimized or used to search for other TCM herbs containing these compounds or substructures for the treatment of COVID-19. author/funder.

The DNA of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (referred to GenBank, accession number MN908947) was synthesized (Hienzyme Biotech) and amplified by PCR using primers n3CLP-Nhe (5'-CATGGCTAGCGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTCCC-3') and n3CLP-Xho (5'-CACTCTCGAGTTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGC-3'). The PCR product was digested with Nhe I/Xho I and cloned into the pET 21a DNA as reported previously [41] . The resulting SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x plasmid encodes a 35 064 Da SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x plasmid was further transformed to E. coli BL21<DE3> for protein expression as reported [41] . The recombinant protein was purified through a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) and subsequently loaded on a gel filtration column Sephacryl S-200 HR (GE Healthcare) for further purification as previously described [42] .
A colorimetric substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (GL Biochemistry Ltd) and assay buffer (40 mM PBS, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton 100, pH 7.3) was used for the inhibition assay. Stock solutions of the inhibitor were prepared with 100% DMSO. The 100 µl reaction systems in assay buffer contain 0.5 µM protease and 5% DMSO or inhibitor to the final concentration.

And then add 10 µl 2 mM substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (dissolved in water) into above system to final concentration of 200 µM to initiate the reaction. Increase in absorbance at 390 nm was recorded for 20 min at interval of 30 s with a kinetics mode program using a plate reader (Synergy, Biotek).
The percent of inhibition was calculated by Vi/V0, where V0 and Vi represent the mean reaction rate of the enzyme incubated with DMSO or compounds. IC50 was fitted with Hill1 function.
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB ID 6LU7) [14] and S. baicalensis components were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard and LigPrep module, respectively. Then, the binding site was defined as a 20*20*20 Å 3 cubic box centered to the centroid of C145. After that, molecular docking was performed using Glide. Extra precision (XP) and flexible ligand sampling were adopted. Post-docking minimization was performed to further refine the docking results. All the above mentioned modules were implemented in Schrödinger version 2015-4 (Schrödinger software suite, L. L. C.
