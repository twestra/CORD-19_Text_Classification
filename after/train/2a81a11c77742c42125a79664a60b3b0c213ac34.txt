Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease that was first reported 25 in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.
Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective 27 cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, 28 comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. 29 Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar were 30 searched to detect relevant publications up to 22 March 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool 31 data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test 32 were also done. 33 Results: In total, six retrospective studies with 22,350 COVID-19 infected patients and 741 cases 34 of death were included in the current meta-analysis. A significant positive association was found 35 between older age (≥65 years old) and COVID-19 mortality (combined effect size=2.39 (over 36 twofold), 95% CIs=1.75-3.28, p<0.001). Such finding was also seen for hypertension (combined 37 effect size=3.29 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.54-7.05, p=0.002), diabetes (combined effect 38 size=3.11 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.10-8.80, p=0.032), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 39 (COPD) (combined effect size=7.69 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=5.65-10.47, p<0.001) and 40 cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (combined effect size=7.39 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=2.88-41 18.96, p<0.001).
42 Conclusions: Older age, hypertension, diabetes, COPD and CVDs were associated with greater 43 risk of death from COVID-19 infection. These findings could help clinicians to identify patients 44 with poor prognosis at an early stage.
In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously 49 known as 2019-nCoV) was first reported in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, 50 and has subsequently spread to other regions of China and 199 countries and territories (1-3).
SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to a unique clade of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the 52 Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (4), was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 in 53 February, 2020, by World Health Organization. 54 Patients with COVID-19 present primarily with fever, dry cough and fatigue or myalgia (5). 55 Although most patients with COVID-19 are thought to have a favorable prognosis, older patients 56 and those with chronic diseases may have worse outcomes (6). Patients with chronic underlying 57 conditions may develop viral pneumonia, dyspnea and hypoxemia within 1week after onset of the 58 disease, which may progress to respiratory or end-organ failure and even death (7). 59 Several studies have reported the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with death in 60 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (2, 6, (8) (9) (10) (11) . We are aware of no systematic review and meta-61 analysis that summarized available findings in this regard. Thus, we aimed to systematically 62 review the present evidences on the association between age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, 63 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and risk of death 64 from COVID-19 infection, and to summarize the available findings in a meta-analysis. 67 Study protocol 68 The present systematic review and meta-analysis were planned, conducted and reported in 69 adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 70 guidelines (12).
Search strategy 73 We performed a literature search using the online databases of ISI Web of Science, PubMed, 74 Scopus and Google scholar for relevant publications up to 22 March 2020. The following medical 75 subject headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH keywords were used in our search strategy: ("novel 76 coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "COVID-19") AND ("death" OR "mortality" OR "survival" 77 OR "fatal outcome"). Literature search was done by two independent researchers (MP and SY). 78 We also searched the reference lists of the relevant articles to identify missed studies. No restriction 79 was applied on language and time of publication. To facilitate the screening process of articles 80 from databases, all literature searches were downloaded into an EndNote library (version X8, 81 Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, USA). In our meta-analysis, eligible articles were included if they met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) all studies assessing the association between age, gender, comorbidities and mortality risk from 86 COVID-19 infection as the major outcomes of interest; (2) observational studies with retrospective 87 .

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for assessing the quality of included retrospective 98 cohort studies based on the following three major components: selection of the study patients, 99 adjustment for potential confounding variables and assessment of outcome (13). Based on this 100 scale, a maximum of nine points can be awarded to each study. In the present study, articles with 101 the NOS score of ≥ 5 were considered as high quality publications.
Statistical analysis 104 We used HRs, ORs, and RRs (and their 95% confidence intervals) reported for the association 105 between risk factors and mortality from COVID-19 infection, to calculate log RRs and their 106 standard errors (SEs). Then, the overall effect size for mortality in relation to risk factors was 107 calculated using random-effects model. For examining the between-study heterogeneity, we 108 .

To 109 identify potential sources of heterogeneity, we did subgroup analysis according to the predefined 110 criteria as follows: age (≥65 vs. <65), gender (male vs. female), hypertension (yes vs. no), diabetes 111 (yes vs. no), COPD (yes vs. no) and CVDs (yes vs. no). In addition to the main analysis, we carried 112 out sensitivity analysis to find if the overall estimate depended on the effect size from a single 113 study. Assessing the publication bias was done by the formal test of Egger (15). All statistical 114 analyses were conducted using Stata, version 14.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). P-115 values were considered significant at level of < 0.05.
In our initial search, we found 135 papers. Of these, 15 duplicates, 17 non-English, 26 non-human, 120 46 reviews and 17 studies that did not fulfill our eligibility criteria were excluded, leaving 14 121 papers for further evaluation. Out of remaining 14 papers, 8 were excluded because of the 122 following reason: did not report HRs, ORs or RRs with 95% CIs. Finally, we included 6 123 retrospective studies in the current systematic review and meta-analysis ( Figure 1 ).
Study characteristics 126 All studies were conducted in Wuhan, China and used retrospective cohort design (2, 6, 8-11). The 127 sample size of studies varied from 172 to 20812 patients (mean age, 58.7 years). Five studies used 128 .

The NOS scores ranged between 5 to 8.
Demographic characteristics and risk of death from In the meta-analysis of six effect sizes, obtained from six studies (2, 6, 8-11) (22,350 patients and 133 741 cases of death), we found that older age (≥65 years old) was associated with a 239% (over pheterogeneity=0.075) and risk of death from COVID-19 ( Figure 3 ). We found that hypertension, 149 diabetes, COPD and CVDs were associated with 329% (over threefold), 311% (over threefold), 150 .

To the best of our knowledge, current study is the first meta-163 analysis to summarize earlier retrospective studies on the association between demographic 164 characteristics, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19. 165 Our findings are partially in agreement with previous narrative review (16). Previously, older age 166 has been reported as an important risk factor for mortality in SARS and Middle East respiratory 167 syndrome (MERS) (17, 18). The current meta-analysis confirmed that increased age (≥65 years 168 old) was associated with death in COVID-19 patients. The age-dependent defects in B-cell and T-169 cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to prolonged 170 proinflammatory responses and deficiency in control of viral replication, potentially leading to 171 .

Interestingly, SARS and MERS also infected more males compared to females 176 (21, 22). Differences in the levels and type of circulating sex hormones in males and females might 177 influence the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection. Previous study showed that sex hormones 178 modulate the responses of adaptive and innate immunity (23). However, our findings showed that 179 gender was not a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients.
The other risk factors related to death include hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease 181 and CVDs. A previous study showed that hypertension and diabetes are more prevalent in patients 182 with severe MERS infection (22). Similarly, the mortality rate of influenza was significantly higher 183 in patients with hypertension, metabolic disease, CVDs and respiratory system disease (24). 184 Previous studies reported that high protein expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 185 receptor, the receptor for COVID-19, in specific organs correlated with organ failures in SARS 186 patients (25-28). It has been shown that circulating ACE2 levels are higher in patients with 187 hypertension, diabetes and CVDs (29, 30). Therefore, patients with these comorbidities may be 188 more prone to die from COVID-19 infection because of the high expression of ACE2 receptor, 189 though further research on the mechanism is needed.
The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still not completely understood. Cytokine storm is thought to 191 play an important role in disease severity (31).
