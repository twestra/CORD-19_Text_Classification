In silico analysis of RT-qPCR designs recommended by WHO for detection of 1 SARS-CoV-2 and a commercial kit validated following UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and 2 two reference laboratories 3 4 ABSTRACT 24
updated at time of writing the present article against the 705 entries currently available at the 152 NCBI. The three sequences representing the groups of Bat SARS-like-CoV, SARS-CoV, Bat-CoV, 153
and Pangolin-CoV, which showed the highest sequence similarities to these of SARS-CoV-2, were 154 selected to perform a comparative in silico specificity analysis by counting the number of 155 mismatches of the primers and probes of the GPS™ COVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and the other 156 RT-qPCR designs recently published (Table 1 ). An illustration of the mismatching of primers/probe 157 sequences of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, respect of the SARS-CoV-2 158 (MN975262.1), Bat SARS-like-CoV (MG772934.1), SARS-CoV (AY304489.1), Bat-CoV 159 (KY770859.1) and Pangolin-CoV (EPI_ISL_410539) groups is shown in Figure 2 . Assays for qPCR were prepared as described in the manual provided in the GPS™ COVID-19 163 dtec-RT-qPCR kit (Alicante, Spain). Internal, positive, and negative PCR controls were included. 164
The reaction mixtures were subjected to qPCR in a StepOnePlus™ or a QuantStudio3 (ABI), 165 programmed with a standard regime composed by first retrotranscription step at 50 ºC for 10 min, 166 followed by a denaturation step at 95 °C for 1 min, and 40 cycles of amplification as follows: 167 denaturation at 95 ºC for 10 second, annealing/extension at 60 ºC for 60 seconds. Standard curve 168 calibration of the qPCR was performed by preparing ten-fold dilution series containing 10 to 10 6 169 copies of standard template provide in the kit, but also using 5·10 6 to 5·10 copies of two complete The method for SARS-CoV-2 detection using the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was 177 subjected to strict validation according to guidelines of the UNE/EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and 178 the range; X, the copy number logarithm; a, slope of the linear regression and b, the cut-off respect 186 of Y axis. Average data from the fitted regression lines showed the slope (a) and regression 187 coefficient (R 2 ) values. Criteria for acceptance involve a slope value between -3.587 < a < -3.103, 188 and R 2 higher than 0.98. The Fisher test was performed in order to validate the linear model. The 189 model was accepted when F obtained from assay (Fassay) was lower than F given by a Fisher 190 distribution table (Ffisher) for [v1 = k-1; v2 = k * (n -1)], with a 95% Confidence Interval. Efficiency 191 (E) was calculated according to equations where slope was obtained from the linear regression 192 (a): E = 10 -1/slope ; e = % Efficiency = (E -1) * 100. Efficiency was accepted if 90% < e < 110%. 193
Reliability of the qPCR was estimated through the assessment of repeatability and reproducibility. 194
Both parameters should show variation coefficient values (CV) of < 10 % to be considered 195 acceptable. To evaluate the repeatability of the method, 10 replicates of ten-fold standard dilution 196 series (from 10 6 to 10 standard template copies) were prepared. The test for each replicated 197 dilution serie was performed independently. The coefficient of variation (CV) was estimated as 198 follows, where S is the standard deviation and x ̅ , the average of Ct values: CV = S / x ̅ * 100. For 199
reproducibility, values obtained in the previous test (repeatability evaluation) were compared with 200 values obtained in a new experimental set composed by five standard calibration curves (n = 5) 201 made by a different technician on a different date and a different PCR equipment. The coefficient 202 of variation (CV) was estimated to assess the reproducibility as follows, where Sab is standard 203 deviation between technician a and b, and x ̅ ab is the Ct value averaged from data sets obtained 204 from technician a and b: CV = Sab / x ̅ ab. The limit of detection (LOD) of the qPCR at a 90% 205 confidence level according to the laboratory's procedure test was estimated by performing 15 tests 206 with 10 copies of standard template. Estimation of the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method 207 generating a repeatability result was achieved by analysing the results with a t-Student test with a 208 95% Confidence Interval. Assays were performed for two sets of 15 tests for both, 10 and 5 copies 209 of standard templates. Results of quantification were used to calculate the experimental t value 210 as follows, where x ̅ is the average of the sample, µ is the reference value of copy number; s is the 211 typical deviation and n is the number of samples: t = (x ̅ -µ) / (s / √n). The accuracy of the LOQ 212 was acceptable if the t value obtained from the assays was lower than the theoretical value from 213 a Student table (t value < t Student ; freedom degree n -1). 214

A preliminary SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence alignment by BLAST showed over 99.9% of overall 227 sequence similarity between all SARS-CoV-2 sequences available. The closest relatives to SARS-228
CoV-2 sequences were these belonging to Betacoronavirus strains of SARS-CoV, Bat SARS-like-229
CoV, Bat-CoV, and Pangolin-CoV. Therefore, 10 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 25 of the most 230 closely related strains representing these Betacoronaviruses, were selected to build the 231 phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 Number of mismatches found with sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (inclusivity) and these for the rest 247 of Betacoronaviruses were annotated in Table 1 . All RT-qPCR designs subjected to study showed 248 they are inclusive for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, it is worth of note that the probe for N gene 249 designed by Hong Kong University (25), showed 4 mismatches with all SARS-CoV-2 sequences 250

In terms of exclusivity however, the highest number of mismatches was found in the 251 GPS™ RT-qPCR design, ranging from 19 to 48 (Pangolin-CoV and Bat-CoV, respectively), often 252 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The Institut Pasteur, Paris (18) has proposed two RT-qPCR designs for the RdRp 257 gene, so-called IP2 and IP4. Although in overall IP2 and IP4 showed a total of 6-12 and 12-17 258 mismatches respectively, both exhibited only 4 mismatches with some Pangolin-CoV sequences. 259

Empirical validation terms were evaluated for a minimum of 10 assays (15 in the case of LOD and 292 LOQ) and results were subjected to stablished criteria for acceptance (Table 2) and 0.9986, respectively, the Fassay (0.014) was lower than the Ffisher (5.318), and efficiency 300 obtained was 93.1%, considering these values acceptable. The CV values, to assess the reliability 301 of the method, ranged from 0.53% to 1.31% for repeatability, and 0.59% to 1.83% for 302 reproducibility. LOD for 10 copies was 100% reproducible and accuracy of LOQ of 10 copies was 303 acceptable as the t value (0.582) was lower than the theoretical value from a Student table (tStudent 304 = 2.145). Finally, the results obtained in the diagnostic validation of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-305 RT-qPCR Test by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) are shown in Table 3 . Full agreement 306 was obtained by comparing data resulting from this commercial kit and these from the reference 307 qPCR used by ISCIII. Consequently, 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and 100% of diagnostic 308 specificity was assigned. The GPS™ kit was also evaluated by the Public Health England (PHE; 309
Colindale, London, UK) and results completely correlated (100%) with these determined by the 310 PHE in house assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2 (not 311 shown). 312 313
Only three months ago, an outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-315
CoV-2 started in Wuhan (China) and rapidly expanded to almost all areas worldwide. Early, 316
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a novel coronavirus and a first genome was provided on 317 the 7 th January. Due to the need of urgent detection tools, several laboratories developed RT-318 qPCR methods by designing primers and probes from the alignment of a single SARS-CoV-2 319 genome sequence with known SARS-CoV, and the protocols were published at the WHO website 320 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Consequently, at the end of January, the kit GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was available 324 worldwide, being this company one of the pioneers able to commercialize a PCR-kit for the CoVID-325
19. The sensibility of the test is also crucial as positive patients should be found at early stages of 326
CoVID-19 and in asymptomatic patients. (Table 1 ). In overall, all 345 qPCR designs were inclusive for SARS-CoV-2 as primers and probes showed a good matching. Medicine (25) showed 4 mismatches which may affect to its binding, particularly considering the 348 low melting temperature according to the primary structure of this probe. In some cases, single 349 nucleotide mismatching was observed in some primers, but none of them were located close to 350 primer 3'-end. Considering all updated alignments, the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Australia/VIC01/2020 351 (GenBank No.: MT007544.1) was the only sequence which showed a unique mismatch to the 352 probe designed for the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test. Therefore, the test was run by using 353 ten-fold dilution series containing 5·10 to 5·10 6 of the synthetic RNA genomes from SARS-CoV-2 354 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The in silico analysis for exclusivity was more complex, showing a wide range of discriminative 359 power for the methods subjected to analysis (Table 1) . For instance, the two RT-qPCR designs 360 IP2 and IP4 developed by Institut Pasteur seems to discriminate well between SARS-CoV-2 and 361 other respiratory virus as confirmed for a panel of specimens (18). The present in silico analysis 362 showed a considerably mismatching respect to other SARS, Bat SARS and related coronavirus. 363
The CDC from Atlanta (USA) designed 3 different primer/probes sets named N1, N2 and N3 (23). 364
We found a low exclusivity in the N3 primer/probe, but a few weeks ago, this set was removed CoV, P2 probe is specific only for SARS-CoV-2.

RdRp/Hel, cross-reacted with SARS-CoV culture lysates (17). Above findings agreed with 391 expected exclusivity derived from the present study. Two additional comparative in vitro analysis 392 of some RT-qPCR designs have recently been published (36, 37). These primer/probes of 393
ORF1ab from The National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention from China (24), 394 seems to be the most sensitive but the assays N2, N3 from the Centers for Disease Control and 395
Prevention, Atlanta, and the N-targeted assay from the National Institute of Infectious Disease, 396
Japan, were the most recommended (36). This partially disagrees our findings as the N3 design 397 may react with other coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2 (recently removed for the CDC panel). In 398 the study by Arun et al., 2020 (37), the specificity of methods from Charité (Berlin) and CDC 399 (Atlanta) was tested finding no false positive results but differences in the sensitivity was observed. 400
The most sensitive were N2 (CDC) and E (Charité-Berlin). However, the present study indicates Table 2 . The study of the 410 quantitative PCR phase within the standard curve is essential to afford quantification experiments. 411
The analysis was repeated a minimum of ten times and average value for a (slope) was the 412 optimum according to the limits of standards, as well as the regression coefficient (R 2 =1). The 413 linear model was evaluated by the Fisher test, resulting in an obtained value for Fassay notably 414 lower than this of Ffisher (given by a Fisher table), therefore, the model was accepted. The efficiency 415 or yield of the PCR amplification was found to be = 93.1%, fitting well in the range of 90-110%. 416
Reliability, considered as the ability of a method to produce results free of random errors, was 417 estimated through the assessment of repeatability and reproducibility. While the first was 418 evaluated by testing independently the prepared 10 replicates of standard ten-fold dilution series 419 (from 10 6 to 10 standard template copies), the reproducibility was assayed comparing the results 420 obtained in the ten previous tests (repeatability evaluation) with the results obtained from five 421 standard calibration curves (n = 5) made by a different technician on a different date and a different 422 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.065383 doi: bioRxiv preprint reproducibility, was always much lower than 10% (Table 2) , therefore the test was considered 424 repeatable and reproducible. To accept a PCR limit of detection (LOD) we should ascertain the 425 smallest number of target units generating a positive amplification at a 90% confidence level. The 426 LOD was tested with the usual protocol for 10 copies repeated 15 times with a positive result in 427 all cases (100%). The estimation of the PCR limit of quantification (LOQ) involved determination 428 of the lowest number of target units able to generate a repeatability result of quantification. Assays 429 were performed for two sets of 15 tests for both 10 copies of standard templates. The LOQ 430 measurement in both cases was validated with a t-Student test with a confidence interval of 95%, 431
considering the acceptable accuracy limit of quantification. Consequently, the calculated 432 parameters to evaluate repeatability/reproducibility (reliability) and sensitivity (detection and 433 quantification limits) were all accepted and the kit GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test passed 434 this validation. The kit received diagnostic validation at two different reference laboratories (ISCIII, 435
Madrid; and PHE, London). The results shown in Table 3 indicated 100% of diagnostic sensitivity 436 and 100% of diagnostic specificity was assigned, demonstrating the reliability of the GPS™ 437
