ABSTRACT 39 Background: SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated 40 with respiratory-related morbidity and mortality. Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are 41 important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response.
42 Methodology: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies by luciferase 43 immunoprecipitation assay systems (LIPS) to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed 44 in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. A subset of 45 samples was tested with and without heat inactivation. 46 Results: Fifteen or more days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 47 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while antibodies to spike 48 protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the 49 rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of 50 daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies 51 appearing between day 8 to day 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients 52 generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to immunocompetent 53 patients. 54 Conclusions: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than 55 spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples by LIPS 56 is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing 62 coronavirus disease 2019 , were first reported in China [1] [2] [3] [4] . The major clinical 63 feature of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 is virus-associated pneumonitis [5] [6] [7] . Unlike other highly several groups have reported serological diagnostic tests using the nucleocapsid and/or spike 80 protein from SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA [11, 16, 17] , immunofluorescence [18] and even a lateral 81 flow test [19] . One study that used ELISA to measure only antibodies to the nucleocapsid 82 protein found that patients become seropositive 10-18 days after the onset of symptoms [16] . A 83 commercial ELISA using the spike protein demonstrated that IgG antibodies were detectable at a 84 for use under a CC0 license. This article is a US Government work.

To et al. examined antibodies against both the 85 spike and nucleocapsid by ELISA in a small number of samples and found that IgG antibodies 86 against the nucleocapsid protein were generally detectable at about the same time as antibodies 87 to the spike protein [11] . Despite these findings, further studies are needed to better understand 88 antibody dynamics in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most sensitive and 89 specific antibody assays, and to use these antibody-based tests to determine seroprevalence in 90 different populations. In addition, it is currently unknown whether the viral RNA that has been 91 detected in the blood [11, 13] indicates the presence of infectious virus, but this has the potential 92 to be a safety hazard for health care workers, clinical laboratory technicians and researchers 93 analyzing serology in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a sensitive and specific 94 antibody assay using heat treated plasma or serum may enhance safety when working with these 95 fluids. 96 We and others have employed a liquid phase immunoassay technology termed Luciferase 97 Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) to measure antibodies against many different viruses, to 98 stratify infected patients based on the level of their antibodies, and for virus discovery [20] . range up to 6 log10 for some antigens and require < 5 ul of plasma or sera for testing.

The LIPS assay showed high sensitivity and specificity for 109 detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and demonstrated that nucleocapsid antibodies emerge before 110 spike antibodies. Moreover, as there are potential safety issues related to the presence of SARS-111 CoV-2 RNA in blood, we show that heat inactivation of plasma at 56˚C for 30 min does not 112 significantly reduce the sensitivity of the LIPS assay and thus allows testing to be performed 113 more safely.

Evaluation of samples collected at <14 days after onset of symptoms showed reduced 218 sensitivity, but specificity was maintained.

Taken together, our findings indicate that detection of antibodies against 224 the nucleocapsid protein is more sensitive than detection of antibodies against the spike protein, 225 and that nucleocapsid antibodies generally appear earlier than spike antibodies.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed patients, suspected cases of COVID-19 227 from EH were also analyzed for seropositivity. Nine of the ten suspected cases without viral PCR 228 confirmation, that showed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 collected between January and 229 February 2020, were seronegative for both nucleocapsid and spike antibodies (Figure 1) . 230 Interestingly, one case from March 2020 from a person who was a household contact with a 231 SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ patient, was seropositive for both nucleocapsid and spike antibodies.
