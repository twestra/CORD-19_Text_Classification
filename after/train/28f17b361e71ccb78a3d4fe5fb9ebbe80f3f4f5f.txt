Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected 25 humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of 26 COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been 27 written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect 28 disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. 29
The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry 30 rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females 31 will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. 32
This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies 33 designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 34 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants 35 documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that 36 rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people.
non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the 39 class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 40 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of 41
European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and 42 almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. 43
Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may 44 ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the 45 basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical 46 SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in 47 human host genetic variation has long been recognized as mitigating the outcome of infestation by 70 malarial parasites (reviewed by Kariuki and Williams 15 ) . 71
The human ACE2 protein has recently been shown to serve as the binding site and point-of-72 entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. 16 ACE2 had also previously been shown to bind SARS-CoV, 17 73 a related virus that caused serious respiratory infections in humans in the early 2000s. The viral Spike 74 glycoproteins ("S" proteins) of SARS-CoV 18 and SARS-CoV-2 19 bind physically to the peptidase 75 domain of ACE2 using their receptor binding domains (RBD), thereby enabling viral internalization. 76
We note here that the ACE2 gene is located on the X-chromosome; human males are 77 hemizygous for the gene, expressing only one haplotype from their maternally-derived allele. Females, 78 by contrast, have two X chromosomes and generally express both their paternal and maternal alleles in 79 a mosaic distribution that is determined by early X-inactivation. Since we have prior knowledge that 80 the ACE2 protein is bound directly by the viral S protein, and since prior protein-protein interaction 81 modelling has identified specific amino acid residues within ACE2 that are bound directly by SARS-82
CoV-2, we propose here that coding variants at these specific sites are likely to be a genetic risk factor 83 for progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 disease, and we further propose that this 84 risk would affect human males and females differently. 85
Methods 87
The gnomAD database of human genetic variation catalogues coding variants from 141,456 88 adults without childhood-onset neurodevelopmental syndromes. 20 Though little phenotypic detail is 89 available on participants, this database serves as a convenient reference of "background" human 90 genetic variation. We accessed the ACE2 entry in the gnomAD database (v.

Among males, the prevalence of 102 a rare X-linked variant is equivalent to the MAF for that allele. For females, the prevalence of a rare X-103 linked variant is equivalent to twice the MAF for that allele, because females have two X chromosomes 104 (and hence, twice the number of X-linked alleles). We retrieved CADD scores from a downloaded 105 version of CADD v1.4; the Phred-scaled CADD score 21 is reported for position and allele combination. 106
We also used the online tool LIST 22 to estimate deleteriousness of coding amino acid substitutions in 107 ACE2. Three-dimensional modelling used MolSoft. 23 We also used the method of Schapira et al. 24 to 108 estimate the change in binding energy that would accrue for the 15 naturally-occurring missense 109
ACE2 is annotated as being intolerant to pLoF single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), with 3 pLoF 113 Table 1) . 126
The range varied from 158,104 X chromosomes genotyped successfully for p.Val488Ala to 183,374 X 127 chromosomes that genotyped successfully for p.Glu35Lys. Variant frequencies in Supplementary Table  128 1 were calculated using the number of alternate allele counts as the numerator and the number of 129 chromosomes genotyped successfully at the locus as the denominator. Aggregating the allele 130 frequencies of ACE2 variants located at the SARS-CoV-2 binding site (i.e. excluding p.Asn720Asp 131 because it is not at the binding site) yields a frequency of 0.0041, which estimates that roughly 3.9 132 .

Importantly, these rare alleles are not distributed evenly 134 across human subpopulations, as outlined below. 135
The only common missense Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is rs41303171, predicted 136 to encode p.Asn720Asp (UniProt Accession Number Q9BYF1). This SNP was observed in 1. is predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2, so it is not an obvious candidate site for this particular host-150 pathogen interaction. 151
The various superpopulations and subpopulations in gnomAD each offer different sample sizes. 152
For rare X-linked variants it is best to deconvolute allele frequencies by both sex and subpopulation, to 153 achieve a fuller picture of the prevalence of hemizygous males in individual regions or countries. Any 154 disease risk signal conferred by a functional X-linked allele will otherwise be diluted by lumping 155 hemizygous males in with heterozygous female carriers, who are likely at a lower risk due to mosaic 156 expression of the variant. After rs41303171, rs4646116 is the next-most-common missense ACE2 157 variant (global MAF 0.4%); it is predicted to encode p.Lys26Arg. Our 3D modelling predicted 158 p.Lys26Arg to lie immediately beside the ACE2-Spike protein interface (albeit with the lysine side 159 chain pointing away from the interface). Prior work on ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV 18, 26 and recent 160 work on ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 27, 28 by others has identified three main S protein binding 161 domains within ACE2. The largest includes Gln24, Thr27, Phe28, Asp30, Lys31, His34, Glu35, 162
Asp38, Tyr41, Gln42 and Leu45. The smallest comprises Met82 and Tyr83, and the last includes 163 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Lys353 to Arg357 make up the Loop and beta-5-helix. 166
We estimated a high prior probability that human germline coding variants affecting these key 167 binding residues would also affect the affinity of the endogenous human ACE2 protein for the viral 168 be at or near the ACE2-S protein interface. All of these variants occur naturally in humans, and could 172 plausibly affect risk for progression to COVID-19 after an initial encounter with SARS-CoV-2.

Rare deleterious X-linked alleles will be depleted in live 216 male adults, and observed disproportionately among heterozygous carrier females. Thus, the 217 observation that this class of alleles is more than twice as common among females as in males may 218 reflect some degree of historical selection against these alleles. We went on to calculate subpopulation-219 specific frequencies by sex, as .vcf files downloadable from the gnomAD interface provide the 220 breakdown of exomes and genomes by subpopulation and by sex. rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) is found at The CADD scores among this class of alleles range from 0.017 to 24.9. We provide these 239 scores here for interest. LIST scores for predicting the deleteriousness of all possible missense ACE2 240 alleles are available at https://list.msl.ubc.ca/proteins/Q9BYF1. We offer the caveat that scores of 241 deleteriousness are difficult to interpret in this context, because they are not based on specific 242 characteristics of a protein's ability to bind to coevolved (or in this case, newly-evolved) partners. 243
Applying the method of Schapira et al., 24 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026633 doi: bioRxiv preprint measures of environmental exposures, and typically identify tagging SNPs linked to loci with small 278 effect sizes. These methods, their attendant complexities, and the conservative genomewide thresholds 279 they require are justified by the fact that previous candidate-gene studies had extremely high false-280 discovery rates, 33 largely due to the use of convenience samples that generated artefactual signals 281 owing to population stratification (i.e. the fact that SNP allele frequencies vary between ancestral 282 populations for historical reasons that are unrelated to heritable risk for disease). However, given the 283 truly staggering number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the rapid progression from COVID-19 to death 284 (often within 14 days), such labour-intensive gene-agnostic methods are unlikely to yield clinically-285
actionable results during the current pandemic. 286
For these reasons, we argue that prior knowledge of SARS-CoV biology and emerging 287 knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 similarities to SARS-CoV justify the assessment of variation within 288 human ACE2 as an exceptionally strong candidate gene for host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 289
The fact that ACE2 is X-linked means that rare variants that enhanced SARS-CoV-2 binding in vivo 290 would likely increase susceptibility to COVID-19 among males. Other functional effects are possible 291 also; for example, female variant carriers might have a shorter asymptomatic period, or be more likely 292 to develop symptoms, irrespective of viral shedding status. Given that a limited number of coding 293 variants in ACE2 are predicted to affect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, these variants could 294 be genotyped rapidly in early-onset cases (e.g. paediatric cases, or even cases under age 40) as a pilot 295 study in the United States and/or in European countries where case numbers are high, case fatality 296 appears to be high and the rare alleles are likely to be found. The delivery of viral nucleic acid testing 297 to affected populations is a more urgent need, but given that many viral samples are already being 298 collected, the addition of a rapid assay targeting the SNVs listed here would be an efficient means to 299 gather data to test this hypothesis. Notably, tests of rare variant burden do lose power rapidly if neutral 300 variants and variants with opposing functional effects are grouped together, so we have restricted 301 ourselves to variants with prior evidence of involvement in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding. There 302 are many more missense ACE2 variants in gnomAD; the aggregate crude prevalence of all rare (i.e. 303 excluding the common p.Asn720Asp) missense variants in gnomAD males is 2.49% and in gnomAD 304 females is 5.81%. Furthermore, among patients with extreme outcomes such as death from COVID-19 305 in childhood (or asymptomatic super-spreaders, if any are found), sequencing of the entire ACE2 306 coding region might conceivably identify ultra-rare "private" variants not catalogued in gnomAD, 307 enabling assessment of the role of these variants in the conversion from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection 308 to COVID-19.

Procko has done unbiased mutagenesis of the ACE2 regions that bind to the RBD of SRS-312 COV-2, 34 and noted that substitution of Thr27 with hydrophobic residues (e.g. alanine) is expected to 313 increase the ability of aromatic residues of the S protein to pack into the ACE2 interface. Procko proteins are urgently justified. Furthermore, given recent data that human recombinant soluble ACE2 321 (hrsACE2) can block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 35 any naturally-occurring human ACE2 322 variant that bound more tightly to the viral spike protein might serve as a better "decoy" for the viral 323 protein, and would be a candidate for novel hrsACE2 molecules with therapeutic potential. 324
Whether or not these studies can be done in time to affect patient outcomes during the current 325 pandemic, the fact that three pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, 36 MERS-CoV 37 and SARS-CoV-326 2 38 ) have emerged in the past two decades, two of which bind and enter via ACE2, augurs that 327 additional coronaviruses that bind to ACE2 are likely to emerge in the future. Thus, knowledge of this 328 specific host-pathogen interaction at the molecular level is important to have at this time.
