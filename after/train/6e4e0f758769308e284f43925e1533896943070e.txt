SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-23
19 pandemic that has resulted in more than one million infections and 73,000 24 deaths 1,2 . Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the 25 pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein 26 promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. 27
Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S 28 identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One 29 antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 30 pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-31 binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show 32 that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the 33 sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody 34 cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further 35 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of 36 neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and 37 S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of 38 exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease. 39 40 author/funder.

The S 42 glycoprotein comprises two functional subunits: S1 (divided into A, B, C and D domains) 43 that is responsible for binding to host cell receptors and S2 that promotes fusion of the 44 viral and cellular membranes 4,5 . Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the 45 sarbecovirus subgenus and their S glycoproteins share 80% amino acid sequence 46 identity 6 . SARS-CoV-2 S is closely related to the bat SARS-related CoV (SARSr-CoV) 47
RaTG13 with which it shares 97.2% amino acid sequence identity 1 . We and others 48 recently demonstrated that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is a 49 functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as is the case for SARS-CoV 1,6-8 . The S domain 50 B (S B ) is the receptor binding domain (RBD) and binds to hACE2 with high-affinity, 51
possibly contributing to the current rapid SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans 6,9 , as 52 previously proposed for SARS-CoV 10 . 53
As the coronavirus S glycoprotein mediates entry into host cells, it is the main 54 target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of therapeutic and vaccine design 55 efforts 3 . The S trimers are extensively decorated with N-linked glycans that are 56 important for protein folding 11 and modulate accessibility to host proteases and 57 neutralizing antibodies 12-15 . Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of SARS-58
CoV-2 S in two distinct functional states 6,9 along with cryoEM and crystal structures of 59 SARS-CoV-2 S B in complex with hACE2 16-18 revealed dynamic states of S B domains, 60 providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. 61 Passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could have a major 62 impact on controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by providing immediate protection, 63 complementing the development of prophylactic vaccines. Accelerated development 64 of mAbs in a pandemic setting could be reduced to 5-6 months compared to the 65 traditional timeline of 10-12 months (Kelley B., Developing monoclonal antibodies at 66 pandemic speed, Nat Biotechnol, in press). The recent finding that ansuvimab 67 (mAb114) is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic Ebola virus infection is a 68 striking example of the successful use of mAb therapy during an infectious disease 69 outbreak 19,20 . We previously isolated potently neutralizing human mAbs from memory 70 B cells of individuals infected with SARS-CoV 21 or MERS-CoV 22 . Passive transfer of 71 these mAbs protected animals challenged with various SARS-CoV isolates and SARS-72 related CoV (SARSr-CoV) 21,23,24 , as well as with MERS-CoV 22 .

In 75 particular, while both mAbs blocked S B attachment to the host receptor, the SARS-76 CoV-neutralizing S230 mAb acted by functionally mimicking receptor-attachment and 77 promoting S fusogenic conformational rearrangements 14 . Another mechanism of 78 SARS-CoV neutralization was recently described for mAb CR3022, which bound a 79 cryptic epitope only accessible when at least two out of the three S B domains of a S 80 trimer were in the open conformation 25,26 . However, none of these mAbs neutralize 81 SARS-CoV-2. 82 83 Identification of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb from a SARS survivor 84 We previously identified a set of human neutralizing mAbs from an individual 85 infected with SARS-CoV in 2003 that potently inhibited both human and zoonotic 86 SARS-CoV isolates 21,23,27 . To characterize the potential cross-reactivity of these 87 antibodies with SARS-CoV-2, we performed a new memory B cell screening using 88 peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected in 2013 from the same patient. We 89 describe here nineteen mAbs from the initial screen (2004 blood draw) 21,23 and six 90 mAbs from the new screen (2013 blood draw). The identified mAbs had a broad V 91 gene usage and were not clonally related (Table 1). Eight out of the twenty five mAbs 92 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S transfected CHO cells with EC50 values 93 ranging between 1.4 and 6,100 ng/ml, and 0.8 and 254 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1a-94 b). MAbs were further evaluated for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S B 95 domains as well as to the prefusion-stabilized OC43 S 28 , MERS-CoV S 29,30 , SARS-96
CoV S 30 and SARS-CoV-2 S 6 ectodomain trimers. None of the mAbs studied bound to 97 prefusion OC43 S or MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimers, indicating a lack of cross-98 reactivity outside the sarbecovirus subgenus (Extended Data Fig.1) . MAbs S303, 99 S304, S309 and S315 recognized the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs. In 100 particular, S309 bound with nanomolar affinity to both S B domains, as determined by 101 biolayer interferometry (Fig. 1c-d, Extended Data Fig. 2) . Unexpectedly, S306 and 102 S310 stained cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S at higher levels than those expressing 103 SARS-CoV S, yet it did not interact with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV S ectodomain 104 trimers and RBD constructs by ELISA. These results suggest that they may recognize 105 post-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S, which was recently proposed to be abundant on the 106 surface of authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses 31 (Fig. 1a-b and Extended Data Fig.3) . : bioRxiv preprint 4 To evaluate the neutralization potency of the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive 108 mAbs, we carried out pseudovirus neutralization assays using a murine leukemia virus 109 (MLV) pseudotyping system 32 . S309 showed comparable neutralization potencies 110 against both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, whereas S303 neutralized 111 SARS-CoV-MLV but not SARS-CoV-2-MLV. S304 and S315 weakly neutralized 112 SARS-CoV-MLV and SARS-CoV-2-MLV (Extended Data Fig.4) . In addition, S309 113 neutralized SARS-CoV-MLVs from isolates of the 3 phases of the 2002-2003 epidemic 114 with IC50 values comprised between 120 and 180 ng/ml and partially neutralized the 115 SARSr-CoV 33 WIV-1 (Fig. 1e) . Finally, mAb S309 potently neutralized authentic 116 SARS-CoV-2 (2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020) with an IC50 of 69 ng/ml (Fig. 1f) . 117 118
To study the mechanisms of S309-mediated neutralization, we characterized 120 the complex between the S309 Fab fragment and a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 121 S ectodomain trimer 6 using single-particle cryoEM. Similar to our previous study of apo 122 SARS-CoV-2 S 6 , 3D classification of the cryoEM data enabled identification of two 123 structural states: a trimer with one S B domain open and a closed trimer. We determined 124 3D reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer with a single open S B 125 domain and in a closed state (applying 3-fold symmetry), both with three S309 Fabs 126 bound, at 3.7 Å and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2a-c, Extended Data Fig. 5 127 and Table 2 ). In parallel, we also determined a crystal structure of the S309 Fab at 3.3 128 Å resolution to assist model building ( Table 3) . The S309 Fab bound to the open S B 129 domain is weakly resolved in the cryoEM map, due to marked conformational variability 130 of the upward pointing S B domain, and was not modeled in density. The analysis below 131 is based on the closed state structure. 132 S309 recognizes a protein/glycan epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 S B , distinct from 133 the receptor-binding motif. The epitope is accessible in both the open and closed S 134
states, explaining the stoichiometric binding of Fab to the S trimer (Fig. 2a-c) . The 135 S309 paratope is composed of all six CDR loops that burie a surface area of ~1,050Å 2 136 at the interface with S B through electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic contacts. 137
The 20-residue long CDRH3 sits atop the S B helix comprising residues 337-344 and 138 also contacts the edge of the S B five-stranded b-sheet (residues 356-361), overall 139 accounting for ~50% of the buried surface area (Fig. 2d-e) . CDRL1 and CDRL2 extend 140 the epitope by interacting with the helix spanning residues 440-444 that is located near 141 author/funder. All rights reserved.

CDRH3 and CDRL2 sandwich the SARS-CoV-2 S glycan 142 at position N343 through contacts with the core fucose moiety (in agreement with the 143 detection of SARS-CoV-2 N343 core-fucosylated peptides by mass-spectrometry 34 ) 144 and to a lesser extent with the core N-acetyl-glucosamine (Fig. 2d) . These latter 145 interactions bury an average surface of ~170 Å 2 and stabilize the N343 oligosaccharide 146 which is resolved to a much larger extent than in the apo SARS-CoV-2 S structures 6,9 . 147 The structural data explain the S309 cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and 148 SARS-CoV as 19 out of 24 residues of the epitope are strictly conserved (Fig. 2f and  149 Extended Data Fig. 6a-b) . R346SARS-CoV-2, R357SARS-CoV-2, N354SARS-CoV-2 and 150 L441SARS-CoV-2 are conservatively substituted to K333SARS-CoV, K344SARS-CoV (except for 151
whereas K444SARS-CoV-2 is semi-conservatively substituted to T431SARS-CoV, in 153 agreement with the comparable binding affinities to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S 154 (Fig. 1c) . The oligosaccharide at position N343 is also conserved in both viruses and 155 corresponds to SARS-CoV N330, for which we previously detected core-fucosylated 156 glycopeptides by mass spectrometry 14 which would allow for similar interactions with 157 the S309 Fab. Analysis of the S glycoprotein sequences of the 2,229 SARS-CoV-2 158 isolates reported to date indicates that several mutations have occurred with variable 159 frequency on the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b) but no 160 mutations arose within the epitope recognized by S309 mAb. Finally, S309 contact 161 residues showed a high degree of conservation across clade 1, 2 and 3 sarbecovirus 162 human and animal isolates 35 (Extended Data Fig. 7c) . Collectively, the structural data 163 indicate that S309 could neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating to date and 164 possibly most other zoonotic sarbecoviruses. 165 166
The cryoEM structure of S309 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S presented here 168 combined with the structures of SARS-CoV-2 S B and SARS-CoV S B in complex with 169 ACE2 [16][17][18]36 indicate that the Fab engages an epitope distinct from the receptor-binding 170 motif and would not clash with ACE2 upon binding to S (Figure 3a-b) . Biolayer 171 interferometry analysis of S309 Fab or IgG binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S B domain or 172 the S ectodomain trimer confirmed the absence of competition between the mAb and 173 ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8) . : bioRxiv preprint 6 To further investigate the mechanism of S309-mediated neutralization, we 175 compared side-by-side transduction of SARS-CoV-2-MLV in the presence of either 176 S309 Fab or S309 IgG. Both experiments yielded comparable IC50 values (3.8 and 3.5 177 nM, respectively), indicating similar potencies for IgG and Fab (Fig. 3d) . However, The 178 S309 IgG reached 100% neutralization, whereas the S309 Fab plateaued at ~80% 179 neutralization (Fig. 3d) . This result indicates that one or more IgG-specific bivalent 180 mechanisms, such as S trimer cross-linking, steric hindrance or aggregation of 181 virions 37 , may contribute to the ability to fully neutralize pseudovirions. 182
Fc-dependent effector mechanisms, such as NK-mediated antibody-dependent 183 cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) can 184 contribute to viral control in infected individuals. We observed efficient S309-and 185 S306-mediated ADCC of SARS-CoV-2 S-transfected cells, whereas the other mAbs 186 tested showed limited or no activity ( Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9a) . These 187 findings might be related to distinct binding orientations and/or positioning of the mAb 188
Fc fragment relative to the FcgRIIIa receptors. ADCC was observed only using NK 189 (effector) cells expressing the high-affinity FcgRIIIa variant (V158) but not the low-190 affinity variant (F158) (Fig. 3e) . These results, which we confirmed using a FcgRIIIa 191 cell reporter assay (Fig. 3f) , suggest that S309 Fc engineering could potentially 192 enhance activation of NK cells with the low-affinity FcgRIIIa variant (F158) 38 . 193 Macrophage or dendritic cell-mediated ADCP can contribute to viral control by clearing 194 virus and infected cells and by stimulating T cell response via presentation of viral 195 antigens 39,40 . Similar to the ADCC results, mAbs S309 and S306 showed the strongest 196 ADCP response (Fig . 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8b) . FcgRIIa signaling, however, 197 was only observed for S309 (Fig. 3h) . These findings suggest that ADCP by 198 monocytes was dependent on both FcgRIIIa and FcgRIIa engagement. Collectively, 199 these results demonstrate that in addition to potent in vitro neutralization, S309 may 200 leverage additional protective mechanisms in vivo, as previously shown for other 201 antiviral antibodies 41,42 . 202 203
To gain more insight into the epitopes recognized by our panel of mAbs, we 205 used structural information, escape mutants analysis 23,27,30 , and biolayer 206 inteferometry-based epitope binning to map the antigenic sites present on the SARS-207 author/funder.

This analysis 208 identified at least four antigenic sites within the S B domain of SARS-CoV targeted by 209 our panel of mAbs. The receptor-binding motif, which is targeted by S230, S227 and 210 S110, is termed site I. Sites II and III are defined by S315 and S124, respectively, and 211 the two sites were bridged by mAb S304. Site IV is defined by S309, S109, and S303 212 mAbs. Given the lower number of mAbs cross-reacting with SARS-CoV-2, we were 213 able to identify sites IV targeted by S309 and S303, and site II-III targeted by S304 and 214 S315 (Fig. 4b) . 215
Based on the above findings, we evaluated the neutralization potency of the site 216 IV S309 mAb in combination with either the site II S315 mAb or site II-III S304 mAb. 217
Although S304 and S315 alone were weakly neutralizing, the combination of either of 218 these mAbs with S309 resulted in an enhanced neutralization potency, compared to 219 single mAbs, against both SARS-CoV-2-MLV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 4c-d  220 and Fig. 1e) . A synergistic effect between two non-competing anti-RBD mAbs has 221 been already reported for SARS-CoV 43 and our data extend this observation to SARS-222
CoV-2, providing a proof-of-concept for the use of mAbs combinations to prevent or 223 control SARS-CoV-2. 224
In summary, our study identifies S309 as a human mAb with broad neutralizing 225 activity against multiple sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, via recognition of a 226 highly conserved epitope in the S B domain comprising the N343-glycan (N330 in 227 SARS-CoV S). Furthermore, S309 can recruit effector mechanisms and synergizes 228 with weakly neutralizing mAbs, which may mitigate the risk of viral escape. Our data 229 indicate the potential to discover potently neutralizing pan-sarbecovirus mAbs, 230 highlight antigenic sites to include in vaccine design, and pave the way to support 231 preparedness for future sarbecovirus outbreaks. As S309 bears the promise to be an 232 effective countermeasure to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, 233
Fc variants of S309 with increased half-life and effector functions have entered an 234 accelerated development path towards clinical trials. 235 236 237 238 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The ranging between 1.4 and 6,100 ng/ml, and 0.8 and 254 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1a-94 b). MAbs were further evaluated for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S B 95 domains as well as to the prefusion-stabilized OC43 S 28 , MERS-CoV S 29,30 , SARS-96 CoV S 30 and SARS-CoV-2 S 6 ectodomain trimers. None of the mAbs studied bound to 97 prefusion OC43 S or MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimers, indicating a lack of cross-98 reactivity outside the sarbecovirus subgenus (Extended Data Fig.1) .

Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function 439 parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp 49 . Particle 440 images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400 yielding a pixel size of 1.05 441 Å. For each data set two rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed 442 using cryoSPARC 50 to select well-defined particle images. Subsequently, two rounds 443 of 3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular sampling 7.5˚ for 25 iterations and 444 1.8˚ with local search for 25 iterations), using our previously reported closed SARS-445

This composite model was generated using the SARS-CoV-2 S/S309 cryoEM structure reported here and a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S bound to ACE2 16 . c, Competition of S309 or S230 mAbs with ACE2 to bind to SARS-CoV S B (left panel) and SARS-CoV-2 S B (right panel). ACE2 was immobilized at the surface of biosensors before incubation with S B domain alone or S B precomplexed with mAbs. The vertical dashed line indicates the start of the association of mAb-complexed or free S B to solid-phase ACE2. d, Neutralization of SARS-CoV-MLV by S309 IgG1 or S309 Fab, plotted in nM (means ±SD is shown, one out of two experiments is shown). e, mAb-mediated ADCC using primary NK effector cells and SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing ExpiCHO as target cells. Bar graph shows the average area under the curve (AUC) for the responses of 3-4 donors genotyped for their FcgRIIIa (mean±SD, from two independent experiments). f, Activation of high affinity (V158) or low affinity (F158) FcgRIIIa was measured using Jurkat reporter cells and SARS-CoV-2 Sexpressing ExpiCHO as target cells (one experiment, one or two measurements per mAb). g, mAb-mediated ADCP using Cell Trace Violet-labelled PBMCs as phagocytic cells and PKF67labelled SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing ExpiCHO as target cells. Bar graph shows the average area under the curve (AUC) for the responses of four donor (mean±SD, from two independent experiments). h, Activation of FcgRIIa measured using Jurkat reporter cells and SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing ExpiCHO as target cells (one experiment, one or two measurements per mAb). Fig. 9) . b, Competition of mAb pairs for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S B domain . c-d, Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2-MLV by S309 combined with an equimolar amount of S304 or S315 mAbs. For mAb cocktails the concentration on the x axis is that of the individual mAbs. Table 1 : Characteristics of the antibodies described in this study.
