Background: Conflicting recommendations exist related to whether masks have a protective effect on the spread of respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, : medRxiv preprint https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.htm [45] Chan JF, Yuan S, Kok K, To KK, Chu H, Yang J, et al.

we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.
Facemasks are recommended for diseases transmitted through droplets and respirators for respiratory aerosols, yet recommendations and terminology vary between guidelines. The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice recently are more complex than previously thought. The concern is now increasing in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1] . The spread of respiratory viral infections (RVIs) occurs primarily through contact and droplet routes. And new evidence suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours [2] . Therefore, the use of masks as appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is often considered when preventing the spread of respiratory infections. Experimental data shows that the micropores of mask block dust particles or pathogens that are larger than the size of micropores. For example, the micropores of N95 masks materials are only 8 microns in diameter, which can effectively prevent the penetration of virions [3] [4] [5] .
Although the aforementioned studies support the potential beneficial effect of masks, the substantial impact of masks on the spread of laboratory-diagnosed respiratory viruses remains controversial [6] . Smith et al. indicated that there were insufficient data to determine definitively whether N95 masks are superior to surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) against transmissible acute respiratory infections in clinical settings [7] .

Another meta-analysis suggested that facemask provides a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.16-1.71, I 2 = 48%) against the 2009 influenza pandemic [8] . Xiao et al.
concluded that masks did not support a substantial effect on the transmission of influenza from 7 studies [6] . On the contrary, Jefferson et al. suggested that wearing masks significantly decreased the spread of SARS (OR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.25-0.40; I 2 = 58.4%) [9] . Up to date, existing evidence on the effectiveness of the use of masks to prevent respiratory viral transmission contradicts each other.
Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of masks to prevent laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus transmission.
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was consulted to report this systematic review. Regarding this meta-analysis, a comprehensive searching strategy was carefully designed to select eligible studies from multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. All included studies were published before March 2020. Relevant Chinese technical terms for the Chinese databases were used to search for published articles (see Appendix 1, for search details).
Furthermore, references of all relevant articles and reviews were retrieved to search for additional eligible studies. Articles just providing abstracts were excluded. After deleting .

We downloaded and read the full text of the potential research related to the selection criteria to incorporate systematic reviews. Reviewers compared and discussed the results. If a discussion by the two reviewers did not result in an agreement, then the third party was called upon to create consensus.
The studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) concerning the relationship between the face mask and preventing RVIs; (2) diagnosis of respiratory virus must have laboratory evidence, or the local clinical diagnostic criteria are applied during an acute large-scale infectious disease when laboratory evidence might be not available; (3) providing complete data of cases and controls for calculating an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); (4) no language restrictions applied. The exclusive criteria were as follows: (1) insufficient data to ascertain the adjusted ORs; (2) conferences/meetings abstracts, case reports, editorials, and review articles; (3) duplicate publication or overlapping studies.
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the case-control study and cohort study: study ratings of seven to nine stars corresponded to high-quality, five to six stars to moderate quality, and four stars or less to low quality [10] .

The association of mask use with subsequent RVIs was assessed with odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Considering the potential for between-study heterogeneity, subgroup analyzes were carried out based on stratification by HCWs, countries, virus types, and study designs. Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting individual studies to assess the stability of the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. The heterogeneity was considered insignificance when P > 0.10 and I 2 < 50%. If the study lacked heterogeneity, the pooled OR estimate was calculated using the fixed-effects model, otherwise the random-effects model was used [12] . Begg's and Egger's test were performed to quantitatively analyze the potential publication bias by Stata (version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX) software. The P values of Begg's and Egger's test more than 0.05 implied no obvious publication bias in this meta-analysis [13, 14] . The meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.3.5 (http://tech.cochrane.org/revman) [15] .

In the subgroup of HCWs only, the protective effect was more obvious, with the pooled OR of 0.20 (95% CI = 0.11-0.37, I 2 =59%) ( Figure 4 ). In one study investigating COVID-19, the OR was 0.04 (95%CI= 0.00-0.60) (35). In the subgroup of non-HCW, a protective effect was found with the pooled OR of 0.53 (95% CI = 0.36 -0.79, I 2 =45%). A more detailed analysis found significant effects in both the household subgroup (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37-0.97，I 2 =31%), and the non-household subgroup (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.33-0.59， 
By geographic locations, beneficial protective effects of wearing masks were found in Asia (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.19-0.50, I 2 =65%), and in Western countries (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24-0.83, I 2 =51%) ( Figure 6 ).

In the non-HCW subgroup, protective effects were found in Western countries (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.34-0.63, I 2 =57%) and Asia (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34-0.78, I 2 =45%) ( Figure 8 ).

This meta-analysis of all 21 available articles provides the most current evidence to date on the efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission of RVIs. The physical characteristics of the mask can prevent the respiratory tract from contacting the outside virus, thereby reducing the risk of infection with respiratory diseases. The latest research by Leung et al.
found that surgical masks significantly reduced the detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, and there was a tendency to reduce coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets [36] . Our study shows that masks worn by non-infected people can effectively prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and reduce the overall risk of respiratory virus infection by 65%.

1 0 meta-analysis in 2010, which suggested that wearing masks were highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS (OR=0.32, 95%CI:0.25 -0.40) [9] . This is especially instructive during periods of high-risk RVIs, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic [1].
During current COVID- The subgroup analysis found that it is effective not only for HCWs who are in close contact with patients but also for the non-HCWs. In non-household settings, wearing masks reduced the risk by 55%. Moreover, significant protective effects were found in the study conducted in the general population [17] , indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public.

These findings implicated that proper use of masks has an impact on the effectiveness of preventing RVIs. Given that most people in household settings were unlikely to strictly follow hand hygiene and mask use recommendations [23], it is more critical to re-evaluate the strategy of self-quarantine or self-isolation at home during current COVID-19 outbreak due to higher risk of family cluster infection [45, 46] .
The risk of influenza, SARS, and COVID-19 infection reduced by 45%, 74%, and 96%, respectively.

Also, the same study indicated that majority of HCWs had received seasonal influenza vaccination, which could play a role of confounding factor contributing to protective effects toward control group. Additionally, it was noted that during acute outbreak of H1N1, specific prevention recommendations and measures lagged behind H1N1 exposures.
This could suggest that HCWs may already have been infected before wearing masks, further decreasing the powers of data collected. Regarding the relationship of different medical fields and practice settings and influenza, Santo el al mentioned that physicians and registered nurses had higher risks of infection compared with outpatient and allied health staff, which could be the result of a higher risk of exposures [48] . However, Jeagers did not conclude the same findings, which could be explained by poor techniques of using PPE (such as poorly fitted N95 masks) among allied health staff [27] .
Due to current controversial guidelines between different countries and areas, regarding the general public wearing masks. We also analyzed its effects based on different geographic locations, showing that wearing masks does provide protective effects in both Asian countries and western countries by 69% and 55%, respectively. Among HCWs, it reduced the risk in both Asian and western countries. Among non-healthcare populations, reduced risk of 54% was found in western countries, and a reduced risk of 49% was found in Asia [29] . The demonstrated reduction in risk was not insignificant and would suggest that the proper use of masks might play a significant role in public health efforts to suppress the spread of RVIs, .

Important knowledge gaps persist. At present, current evidence on the protective efficiency of masks among the general population is still insufficient. Only one study included in our meta-analysis investigated whether people with certain underlying conditions require masks or not [33] . Recall bias in case-control studies seems inevitable [22] . Therefore, high-quality and well-designed RCTs will be desired to investigate the actual protective effectiveness of masks. Although RCT, in general, is the best study design for assessing the effectiveness of interventions [11] , it should be noted that many cluster randomized trials are significantly different from ordinary RCTs (control, randomization and blind). In addition, cluster RCTs included in our study generally have insufficient trial design and low adherence and compliance to interventions Further interventional experiments should also pay attention to the delay between the onset of symptoms and the application of interventions, otherwise, the efficacy of non-drug interventions may be underestimated, or the statistical capacity to detect significant differences may be lacking. Research on enclosed spaces, such as transportation, is relatively rare [32]. Droplet-borne and airborne viruses are likely to cause large-scale infections among passengers sharing closed transportation [49] . In most studies, the detection criteria for virus types are not detailed and clear. Failure to analyze sufficient types of viruses may lead to biased results. For most studies conducted in healthcare settings, there is a lack of data on control subjects without masks. Because it would be unethical to randomly assign health care .

In this situation, MacIntyre's method could be adopted: take a convenient selection method, and choose from the hospital's HCWs in the department without the need for masks as a control [26] .
This study demonstrates the protective effects of masks on HCWs and other populations.
The quality of the included studies was relatively high. There are strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all patients have laboratory evidence or met local clinical diagnostic criteria during the outbreak. No significant publication bias was found. And detailed analysis in different settings, populations, and areas were conducted to better clarify the effectiveness of wearing masks. At present, the epidemic of COVID-19 has caused widespread concern globally. There is already evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from asymptomatic individuals, which undoubtedly puts great pressure on the protection of non-HCWs [50] .
Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the evidence and select effective PPE in the view properly guiding healthcare professionals and general public regarding current COVID-19
pandemic.
This investigation also had several limitations. First, there was a lack of adequately designed and high-quality prospective studies. For clear research purposes, well-planned prospective studies could help us draw stronger evidence to improve understanding of the effectiveness of masks. Second, this article included some studies of SARS patients diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic criteria for SARS due to a low detection rate of RT-PCR [51] .

Third, very few studies included in our analysis investigated the effectiveness of wearing masks by the general public, especially during an outbreak, and only one study investigated whether people with one underlying condition require masks or not [33] . Fourth, published studies have shown that different specifications of masks and different wearing methods may affect the protective effect of masks [17, 32] . And when the included studies divided the time/frequency of wearing masks, we only included the group of masks with the longest wearing/highest wearing frequency. This might also ignore effects of the short/infrequent mask-wearing. In addition, the studies we included were mainly conducted in Asia, especially China, and more evidence from other countries is needed to support our views. Last but not least, information about other confounding biases, such as vaccination, hand hygiene, age, gender, and culture, may affect the protective effect of masks.
Our study showed the effectiveness of wearing masks in protecting HCWs from RVIs, including SARS-CoV-2. Protective effects were also found among non-HCWs in both Western and Asian countries. However, more evidence is still needed to better clarify the effectiveness of wearing masks for different populations, such as patients with certain underlying conditions, or in different settings, such as on flights and subway. For the current global outbreak of COVID-19, we still recommend that the population should follow the current WHO recommendation or local guidelines. If masks are to be used, they should be .
