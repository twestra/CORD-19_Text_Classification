The recent outbreak of the newly emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 24 presents a big challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are not 25 available while there is an increasing evidence that the epidemic is more 26 widespread than initially thought, as well as spreading internationally across 27 borders through travellers does already happen warranting a methodology for the 28 rapid detection of the infection to control SARS-CoV-2. Aim: We intended to 29 develop and deploy a robust and rapid diagnostic methodology using LAMP 30 assay for use in point of care settings to detect SARS-COV-2 infection.
Methodology: In the present study, we have developed a validated rapid 32 diagnostic procedure to detect SARS-CoV-2 using LAMP assay, its design 33 relying on isothermal amplification of the nucleic acids of the SARS-CoV-2.
Results: The LAMP assay developed detects SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly 35 with high sensitivity and reliability. The data generated by LAMP assay were 36 comparable and at par with the data generated by real-time PCR method.
Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the LAMP assay developed 38 was a rapid, reliable, sensitive and cost effective method to detect SARS-CoV-2 39 infection in a point of care as well as in laboratory settings. 40 41 42 43 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To conclude, the present study has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection in 241 humans can be detected by LAMP and RT-LAMP assays by targeting the N and 242 ORF genes of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity.
