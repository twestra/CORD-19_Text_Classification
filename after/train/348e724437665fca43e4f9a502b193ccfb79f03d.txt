The COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading respiratory illness caused with the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The
COVID-19 case-patient) and onset of symptoms in the infectee (a patient receiving the infection from the infector) [8] . The SI may be same as the generation time (renewal time of the infected population), considering the onset of symptoms to be same as the onset of infectiousness [9] . Determination of SI is directly linked to calculating the reproduction number (R), which is the number of infectees generating from one infector.
The basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual in an otherwise susceptible host population [10] . The probability density function (PDF), expressed as = 1 √2 −( − ) 2 2 2 , of the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19 was modeled as Weibull distribution with a mean probability density and standard deviation,
, where MGF is the moment generating function of SI.
A time-varying SIR model was developed on the basis of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per day, and the total population size (N) was divided into three mutually exclusive infection status, assuming that any infectious person (I), has a probability of contacting any susceptible person (S), and later recovered (R), so that = + + . The dynamics of the pandemic in three geographical locations were modeled using the following three differential equations:
where and represent transmission rate and recovery rate respectively, defined as the probability of a susceptible-infected contact resulting in a new infection, and the probability of an infected case recovering and moving into the resistant phase, respectively. The reproduction number was calculated using the ratio of the transmission rate to the recovery rate obtained from SIR modeling. The effective reproduction number Re, defined as the mean number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t in a population, was calculated as an indicator to measure the transmission of COVID-19 both before and after the interventions [10] . The dynamic SIR model was constructed to determine the reproduction numbers, forecast the end date and the final size of the epidemic, by considering the cumulative number of infected cases and the total population number in a country/region as the initial population size N, in optimal and optional model, respectively.
The World Health Organization (WHO), on March 11, 2020, declared COVID-19 a pandemic caused with the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus that first emerged in the Wuhan city of Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread in every country in the world [11] . As of April 9, 2020, more than 2.3 million COVID- 19 .

In the present study, the dynamic changes of the epidemiologic parameters were taken into account at three different geographical locations: India, China, and countries outside China. The prevailing epidemic scenario in India was compared with the situation worldwide in countries outside China, and China only as depicted in Figure 1 , Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively, in each figure (a) to (d) representing variation in daily growth rate (DGR) with infected case numbers, observed case numbers with predicted numbers, case recovery rate (CRR) with case fatality rate (CFR), and SI with R, respectively. Since the first detection of COVID- 19 An undulating pattern of DGR of COVID-19 infected cases was observed for India as well as world excluding China, but with gradual decrease in the latter for the last few days, while in China the DGR was <0.3 % since February 23, 2020 onwards, as found in the present study. Sanche et al. [12] estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak of COVID-19, in China, as 0.21-0.30 per day. The CFR, which was defined as the ratio of deaths from COVID-19 to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence/clinical severity. Therefore, in order to explore the early insights into the severity of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CFR of the disease was also estimated. Yang et al. [13] , using data-driven statistical method, estimated CFR in the early phase of COVID-19 as 0.15% in mainland China without Hubei, 1.41% in Hubei province without Wuhan city, and 5.25% in Wuhan. The COVID-19 CFR in China has been reported to be as high as 15%, due to low initial case number, which on later time decreased to 3·4% [14] . As of March 17, 2020, in Italy, the CFR of COVID-19 has been recorded as 7.2%, which stands higher than the CFR (2.3%) in China, as of February 11, 2020 [15] ; interesting to note, Italy had CFR of 2.3% (as of February 28, 2020), which was identical to the CFR of China [16] . Therefore, though the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is high, the CFR of COVID-19 seems to be lesser compared to that of the other human coronaviruses: SARS (9·5%) and MERS (34·4%), but higher than that of influenza (0·1%) [14] . The CFR in India and the world excluding China showed a rising trend CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Sanche et al. [12] determined the doubling time of COVID-19 at early outbreak, in China, as 2.3 -3.3 days, reflecting the high transmission rate of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of COVID-19 SI is a critical input for determining R0 and the extent of interventions required to control an epidemic [18] . The mean SI for COVID-19 estimated as of February 8, 2020, by Du et al. [19] was 3.96 days, which was shorter than that found in the current study, and as calculated for SARS (8.4 days) [20] , or MERS (14.6 days) [21] as well,
implying that contact tracing strategies must contend with the fast replacement of case generations, resulting into number of contacts surpass the existing healthcare facilities [22] . The mean incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms development) for COVID-19 is approximately 5 days (range 1-14 days) [23] . A longer SI than the incubation period is indicative of symptomatic COVID-19

The earlier studies showed variation of R0 that ranged from 1.4 to 6.49 (mean 3.28), for COVID-19 outbreaks, because of variation in sources of data collection, time periods, and modelling methods used [23, 24] .
The current estimates depict that the R0 values were in the order world(excluding China)> China> India, following DGR as well as SIR methods, while R and Re were in the pattern of world(excluding China)> India> China. This could be explained by the fact that during the initial phase of the epidemic the infected size of COVID-19 was greater in the world, wherein most of the proportion of infected cases were from China, while in the later stage, China contained the SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the time when world excluding China, and India in the later stage, had escalating growth of infected cases. This leads to higher reproduction number compared to that of China with lowest proportion of people susceptible to COVID-19 as well as gradual decrease in the number of cumulative infectious cases (dropping to 1116 as of April 9, 2020), and daily new deaths plummeting trend dropping to one as of April 9, 2020.
The results of the optimal and optional SIR models for India estimate the average R of 5.33 (95% CI 3.05 indicating the potential of the virus to cause and continue outbreaks, and the epidemics to be fade away when the transmissibility could be reduced by 1-1/R0 [25] .
The epidemic size of India, following optimal SIR modeling, was estimated to be ~17,886 (as of April 9, 2020 with 5863 infectious cases) and ~30,284 (as of April 15, 2020 with 12,370 infectious cases)

The epidemic size of the world excluding China, following optimal SIR modeling, was estimated to be ~4,362,777 (as of April 9, 2020 with 1,150,985 infectious cases) and ~6,303,651 (as of April 15, 2020 with 2,004,136 infectious cases) reflecting an estimated end of the epidemic on June 5, 2020, and June 11, 2020, respectively [ Figure 2 (b) ]. It has been estimated earlier by Ranjan [26] , that R0 for India, in relation to COVID-19 pandemic, ranged 1.4-3.9, when data from March 11, 2020 to March 23, 2020 were analyzed, and model within this study predicted an equilibrium of the disease by the end of May, 2020 with infected cases of 13,000 considering the absence of the impact of community transmission and social distancing as well. Currently, China has contained the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedented public health interventions through 76-day massive lockdowns (since January 23, 2020), and that have begun to lift in response to the slowing of the outbreak, which might be informative to public health policy making in other countries [24] .
The association of reproduction number with other epidemiological parameters is shown in Table 2 .
There was significant (p<0.05) association of R with time and SI, globally. The other epidemiologic parameters including the number of infectious cases and total deaths were significantly related to R in China, implying these two variables as an index of R in epidemiologic evolutionary dynamics. However, CFRs in our study were insignificantly associated with R, at three geographical locations, irrespective of the epidemiologic stages. The growth rate of deaths per day has emerged as a useful parameter for tracking the evolution of COVID-19 spread in different regions [27] .
Different mathematical models and studies demonstrated the association between reduction of effective reproduction numbers Re (an indicator to measure the transmission of SARS-CoV-2), effectively to <1, and implementation of public health measures amidst COVID-19 pandemic [24, 28] . India's strategies with massive social distancing: lockdown since March 25, 2020, and traffic restriction combined with mass contact tracing and quarantine, and isolation of infected people are expected to help curbing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and this might be relevant to adopt by other countries facing current testkit shortages [29] . The mean Re value for the pre-lockdown period (before March 25, 2020) was found to be 1.62 (95% CI 1.36 -1.89), and the mean Re for the post-lockdown period was 1.1 (95% CI 0.84 -1.37) (Figure 4) , this decline of Re indicated the effectiveness of the introduced interventions. As has been reported by Zhao and Chen [30] in China, before January 30, 2020, the Re was >1 (range: 1.2-5.9), while after January 30, 2020, Re was <1 (range: 0.51-0.53), suggesting the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control strategies in averting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The Re >1 is indicative of escalation of epidemic at time t (unless effective control measures are operated), while Re <1 defines the shrinking of epidemic size at time t, and consequently the outbreak will stop [10] . There has been a gradual decrease of Re from high level of transmission (Re: 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) .

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is, however, escalating rapidly worldwide, and multiple countries outside China are now experiencing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic that indicates the shortfalls in preparedness. Thus, this is crucial to understand how the stringent strategies (mass lockdown and mass testing alongside) prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China [31] , and to implement this by countries outside China [24] .
This study reflected the latest updates about the COVID-19 epidemic up to April 9, 2020. Also besides single R0 calculation, the study is an attempt to take into account the dynamic variation of R values on 
Combined with the available evidences the current findings suggest the adoption of social distancing (countrywide lockdowns, closing schools and workplaces, and restrictive of mass gatherings and travel) measures in order to shrink the peak intensity of outbreaks, wherein the lifting of the measures results .

Therefore, high grade effective social distancing strategies help reduce the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infections that cause strain on the health care systems, unless critical care capacity is expanded substantially, or a treatment or vaccine becomes available. Also regular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in an urgent manner (even after accomplishing ample control of transmission, if any) is essential for the vigilance of further plausible resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks.
Further, determining CFR of COVID-19 and accounting daily deaths will help track the dynamics of disease spread, formulate control measures and design the supplies of health care systems to mitigate the global crisis of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To note that our prediction is of more academic than applied, and the mathematical model estimates (which is based on the publicly available information) will improve as more data will appear due to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and thus, it will be prudent to review the assessments as epidemics develop, if any.
