The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 illness, has caused over 2 million infections worldwide in four months. In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction.
We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of full-length nsp16 and nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2'-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational 32 changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2'-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2 that may serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development. : bioRxiv preprint of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded β-coronavirus with a large, complex RNA genome 2 . To hijack the host translation machinery for propagation, enzymes encoded by the genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) modify the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs by creating a cap 3 . 44 RNA capping in CoVs involves activities of several nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp13, a bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase (TPase) and helicase; nsp14, a bifunctional 3'à5' mismatch exonuclease and mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase; nsp16, a ribose 2'-O methyltransferase; and an elusive guanylyl transferase 4-7 .
Nsp16 forms an obligatory complex with nsp10 to efficiently convert client mRNA species from the Cap-0 ( me7 GopppA1) to the Cap-1 form ( me7 GopppA1m), by methylating the ribose 2'-O of the first nucleotide (usually adenosine in CoVs) of the nascent mRNA using SAM (S-adenosyl 52 methionine) as the methyl donor 4, 8 . This Cap-1 form serves to avoid induction of the innate immune response 9-11 . Hence, ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to CoV infection and limit pathogenesis 9, 10 . It has been shown that live vaccination with nsp16defective SARS-CoV-1 or an immunogenic disruption of the nsp16-nsp10 interface protects mice 56 from an otherwise lethal challenge 12, 13 , making nsp16/nsp10 an attractive drug target.
Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 in complex with SAM/SAH or sinefungin, but without an RNA substrate, have been reported 4, 8, 14 , so that key information about the catalytic 60 mechanism of mRNA capping in CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, is still missing. To understand the determinants of RNA cap modification and help guide the development of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies, we have now succeeded in solving the high-resolution structure (to 1.8
The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes SARS-CoV-2 one of the deadliest virus in recent history 1 . To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding the RNA cap analog me7 GopppA1. Moreover, we co-crystallized this complex with a series of FDAapproved drugs and found that one such compound, adenosine, associates with a probable allosteric ligand binding site not present in the nsp16/nsp10 orthologues from other SARS or pancoronavirus strains. Thus, we provide a plausible novel framework from which SARS-CoV-2 68 inhibitors may be developed.
We co-purified full-length SARS CoV-2 nsp16 and nsp10 proteins as a complex from E. coli, 72 mixed with nucleoside drugs such as adenosine or 5'-methylthioadenosine and subjected to crystallization screenings (see Methods for details). We anticipated that these drugs may occupy the binding site of SAM due to common features of both, a purine ring plus ribose. Since nucleoside analogues exhibit antiviral activity [15] [16] [17] , a nsp16/nsp10/adenosine complex could then 76 serve as a starting point for medicinal chemistry and perhaps rapid translation. Next, we soaked these crystals with a cap analogue me7 GopppA1 representing the Cap-0 state of the RNA cap, the substrate of this complex. We determined the ternary structure of nsp16/nsp10 by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV-1/SAM binary complex (PDB ID 3R24) 8 structure as a template 80 (Supplementary Table 1 ). The initial difference maps indicated electron densities of SAM and me7 GopppA1 cap in their respective binding pockets. Even though SAM was not included in cocrystallization or soaking experiments, its electron density was unambiguously identified in difference maps (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 2A) . This observation is consistent with the co-84 purification tendency of SAM during isolation from expression hosts, as seen previously with NS5 of ZIKA and VP39 of vaccinia virus cap 2'-O MTases 18, 19 . Unexpectedly, we observed electron density on the opposite face of nsp16, >25 Å away from the catalytic pocket that could fit adenosine (present in our crystallization mixture) reasonably well (Figure 1, Supplementary Fig.  2, 3) . Further examination showed that this adenosine-binding pocket was partially composed of amino acid residues unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) Overall structure 92 Nsp16 adopts a canonical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (SAM-MTase) fold 20 with slight variations 8, 14 . Its protein sequence displays a sequential order of secondary structural element: •β1α1α2β2α3β3β4•β5β6•α4β7α5β8•β9α6•β10•α7β11β12, wherein the '•' denotes a 310-helix ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) . The nsp16 MTase fold consists of a 96 centrally located twisted β sheet of eight strands flanked by two alpha-helices on one side and three helices on the other. The β sheet displays a continuum of four antiparallel (β1β8β9β7) and four parallel (β6β2β3β4) β strands. The cap analogue substrate is situated within the confluence of these two halves. Loops emanating from strands β9, β7, and β6 form a deep groove in the 100 center to accommodate the RNA cap, whereas the methyl donor SAM is bound within a cavity formed by the loops originating from strands β6 and β2. The protein chain emerging from helix α4 runs across this groove and folds into a subdomain (•β10•α7β11β12) that stabilizes the bottom portion of nsp16. The adenosine binding pocket is at the back of the catalytic pocket, ~ 25 Å away ( Fig. 1) .
Nsp10 is a 139 amino acid long zinc-binding protein that stimulates the enzymatic activity of nsp16 4, 8, 14 . We traced all functional regions known for protein-protein and protein-metal binding in 108 nsp10, with the exception of the N-terminal 17 residues that appear to be disordered in our structure, but form an α-helix in the binary state in the absence of a cap structure 4, 8, 14 . Nsp10 adopts a structural fold with two distinct Zn-binding modules, including a gag-knuckle-like fold 21 .
Binding of the RNA cap did not induce any major conformational change in nsp10.
We compared our ternary structure with bound substrate to that of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 bound to SAM (PDB ID 3R24), but without substrate. While the cores of the nsp16 and nsp10 proteins remain largely unperturbed (with an RMSD of 1.11 Å for 292 Cα atoms between the prior CoV-1 structure and our own), we found significant deviations in two regions of nsp16 that constitute the substrate binding pocket. We refer to these regions as gate loop 1 (amino acids 20 -40) and gate loop 2 (amino acids 133 -143) (Fig. 2) . The binding of the Cap-0 substrate results 120 in an ~180° outward rotation of gate loops 1 and 2 by 7 Å and 5.2 Å, respectively compared to their positions in the binary structure. The widening of the pocket that results allows accommodation of the RNA cap substrate, and engages the N 7 -methyl guanosine base of Cap-0 ( me7 Go) in a deep groove formed by residues of gate loop 1 on one side and gate loop 2 on the 124 other ( Fig. 2A, B, D, F) . The loop region immediately downstream of Pro134 that is part of gate loop 2 also flips ~180º in the ternary complex to accommodate the A1 nucleotide ( Fig. 2A) . Gln28 and Asn29 (gate loop 1) orient outward, whereas the side chain of invariant Tyr30 rotates inward, thereby forming a cleft to stabilize the purine ring of me7 Go through a π-π stacking interaction.
The opposite face of the me7 Go purine ring is stabilized by a H-bond between terminal oxygen of Glu173 and the positively charged N7 of me7 Go. The methyl group of me7 Go is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Cys25 (gate loop 1) and Ser202 from the loop connecting the β8 132 and β9 strands. These specific interactions with the positively charged N7 and the methyl moiety of the me7 Go base would confer substrate selectivity against the uncharged GopppA 4 . In gate loop 2, Asn138 rotates outward and the side chain of invariant Lys137 rotates ~180º inward and forms stabilizing electrostatic interactions with all 3 phosphates of the Cap-0 structure and the 3'-O of 136 the me7 Go ribose. Tyr30 and Lys137 form a partial enclosure to restrict the movement of the terminal residue ( me7 Go) of the RNA cap (Fig. 2B, D) . The backbone of gate loop 1 runs perpendicular to the purine ring of me7 Go such that the backbone amide of Leu27 forms a hydrogen bond with O6 of me7 Go to confer specificity for guanine. The ribose sugar of me7 Go is sandwiched by the sidechains of Lys137 and His174 in gate loop 2 (Fig. 2B, D) . The three phosphates of me7 GopppA1 are stabilized through H-bonds with residues located in the loop regions emanating from the β6 (Tyr132, Lys137), β7 (Thr172 and His174) and β8 (Ser 201 and Ser 202) strands ( Fig. 2D) . By comparing our structure with those for the 2'O-MTases of Dengue and Vaccinia viruses, we note that the distance between N1 and me7 Go bases remains unchanged (~10 Å), and the SAM/SAH and N1 in all 3 structures overlay well, but the terminal me7 Go base of CoV-2 RNA cap rotates ~180º (compared to Dengue virus) around the -phosphate to assume a radically different orientation, suggesting a diverse geometric arrangement of the RNA cap in RNA/DNA 148 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 2B ).
SAM occupies the same pocket and orients in a similar manner as in the binary complex (PDB ID 152 3R24). Several loops emanating from the C-terminal ends of the four parallel β strands (β2, β3, β4, and β6) of the central β sheet form a deep groove to accommodate SAM through an extensive network of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2C, F) . In contrast to the substrate pocket, which is largely basic, the SAM binding pocket in nsp16 is enriched by 156 negatively charged residues (Fig. 1B) . The side chains of Asp99 and Asn101 from strand β3 form hydrogen bonds with terminal oxygens of the ribose sugar, whereas the purine ring of SAM is partially circled by side chains of Leu100 (β3) Asp114, Cys115 (β4), and Met131 (β6), and Trp149.
Asp114 makes a base-specific interaction with SAM via a hydrogen bond with the N6 amino group Based on the crystal structures of SAM and SAH-bound SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 complexes, a catalytic mechanism that involves a tetrad consisting of the invariant Lys46, Asp130, Lys170, and Glu203 has been proposed 8, 14 . Our ternary complex has allowed us to examine the model in the presence of the Cap-0 substrate. The catalytic pocket adopts a conical shape where residues of the catalytic tetrad circle a water molecule at the 'bottom' of the cone, whereas the target atom (2'-O) of the A1 nucleotide resides at the 'tip' of the cone. In addition, two invariant asparagine residues -Asn43 and Asn198 -outside of the catalytic tetrad stabilize the water molecule and the 3'-end of the target nucleotide (A1) in the RNA cap, respectively. The methyl group of SAM is positioned 3 Å from the 2'-OH of A1, available for a direct in line attack from the 2'-OH (Fig. 2C, E) . Supporting this concept, nsp16/nsp10 showed robust 2'-O methyltransferase activity. We also observed marked reduction in activity when the initiating nucleotide (N1) was changed from the cognate adenine to non-cognate base guanine (Fig. 2G) . Similar observations 180 were made by previous biochemical studies 8 , but the structural basis of this base discrimination was not clear. There is no base specific contact exists for the N1 base in ternary structure.
However, modeling of a guanine (G) base at this position provides some clues. The Pro134 resides at Van der Waals distance from purine ring of the N1 base. A guanine at N1 will not alter 184 this interaction but the N2 amino group of guanine intrudes into the SAM pocket thereby reducing the distance between guanine and SAM by ~0.7 Å. As a result, positively charged sulfur of SAM may repel purine ring of guanine and thus re-orients its target sugar 2'-OH in an unfavorable position for methyl transfer (Fig. 2H ).
An earlier study posits that the target 2'-OH of the ribose in a ternary complex would initially occupy the position of the water, allowing Asp203 and Lys170 to lower the pKa of the -amino group of Lys46. As a result, Lys46 would become a deprotonated general base and activate the 192 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In our ternary structure, this water molecule resides 3 Å from the target 2'-OH of the A1 base ribose and remains unperturbed in the ternary structure of SARS-CoV-2 (present study) and binary structures (SAM/SAH-bound) of SARS-CoV-1 8, 14 nsp16. If the ribose were to occupy the position of water as suggested 14 , the adenine ring of A1 would sterically clash with SAM. In addition, Lys170 is closer to the 2'OH than Lys46 (Fig. 2E) and is held in place by charged interactions from the side chains of Asp130 and Glu203 from both sides. Consistent with this logic, Lys170 in our ternary complex structure spatially matches with that activating the 2'-OH in 
Thus, the ternary structure that we have described may represent a pre-reaction state of 2'-O methyl transfer.
Next, to better understand the role of acquired mutations in SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 (compared to CoV-1), we aligned nsp16 sequences from 9 coronavirus strains representing all three sub classes (α, β, and ), and mapped their positions in the current structure (Supplementary Fig.   1 ). Although most residues that participate in catalysis and substrate/SAM binding are conserved 216 across species, notable differences were found (Supplementary Fig. 1, 3B) . Compared to CoV-1, acquired mutations span the entire nsp16 sequence: E32D and N33S (gate loop1); K135R . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

( Supplementary Fig. 1, 3B) . Given the role of gate loop regions in RNA substrate binding, 220 mutations E32D and N35S in gate loop 1 and K135R in gate loop 2 may influence RNA binding or enzyme kinetics.
Three specific mutations -S188A (β8), A209C (β9), and E276S (α6) forms part of the adenosine binding pocket. Two of the mutations A209C (β9), and E276S (α6) are not present in any other CoV strain, whereas S188A, is present in one human strain (HKU1), two avian strains (TCoV and IBV) and one mouse strain (MHV) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3 ). At ~ 25 Å away, and on the back of the catalytic center, this ligand binding pocket does not present obvious characteristics 228 for adenine specificity such as an aspartic acid or asparagine residue, which would usually make a hydrogen bond with the N6 amino group of adenines. Nonetheless, it displays two similarities with the SAM binding pocket: the purine ring in both pockets resides in an acidic environment, and both pockets harbor a cysteine near N6 of the purine ring. In the SAM pocket, Cys115 is 4.1 232 Å from the N6 amino group and positioned at a ~ 64º angle between N1 and the C6 atoms of the adenine ring with respect to Cys115 (Fig. 2C ). An equivalent cysteine in the adenosine pocket, Cys209, resides at 3.5 Å, and at a ~ 85º angle from the N6 of adenine. The purine ring of adenosine is further stabilized by stacking interactions with Trp198 and Thr58, and its 5' tail, while 236 exposed to solvent, interacts with Asn13 (Fig. 3A) . Thus, the lack of extensive interactions for adenosine suggests that this pocket is somewhat non-specific but can accommodate small molecules with a heterocyclic ring. Interestingly, a binary structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 (PDB ID: 6W4H) shows a sugar moiety (β-D-fructopyranose) occupying the position of adenosine. In (Supplementary Fig. 4) . Thus, we propose that this distant region endows nsp16 with the unique ability to bind small molecules outside of .
