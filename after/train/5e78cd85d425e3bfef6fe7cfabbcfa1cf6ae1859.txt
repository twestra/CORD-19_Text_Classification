Background: On December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world. There is little information about effects of COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn.
Methods: online data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I 2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals.
A total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was All rights reserved.

Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications and Laboratory data were Analyzed.
Our findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in nonpregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

endotracheal intubation usage and the intensive care unit admission and minimal chance of vertical transmission (7, 8) .
Some investigations reported the medical manifestation and vertical transmission of COVID-19 in pregnancies (9) (10) (11) . Because of the low power of study and small quantity of the samples, there are many essential questions that have to be addressed quickly, including whether severity of symptoms is the greater in pregnant women with COVID-19 as the sensitive population, if expecting mothers with COVID-19 die or give birth earlier, and finally whether COVID-19 could disseminate vertically and infect the embryo. Therefore, to better manage the infection of pregnant women, the present systematic review and meta-analysis has been launched to evaluate clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in the affected expecting women and assess its effect on the pregnancy end-results and neonatal well-being.
A systematic search was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies included epidemiological studies and case-control studies. the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There were two independent reviewers 2019-nCoV, respectively. We used "2019 Novel coronavirus", "Wuhan virus", "covid-19" and " Pregnancy ", "gestation" to identify the relevant studies. For the 2019-nCoV, we searched for all studies published in all language between till 20 March 2020. We used English and Chinese studies.
The meta-analysis was performed using "metan" and "metaprop" programs in STATA version 11 (STATA, College Station, TX, USA) based on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as input. The meta-analysis resulted in pooled (overall) mean and prevalence of characteristics with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins' I 2 statistic and expressed as percentage. Values of 25%, 50%, and 75% for I2 were considered as low, medium, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively. Data were pooled using fixed or random effects model as appropriate. Publication bias was tested using Begg and Egger's tests.
The schematic diagram of selection process and meta-analysis is shown in Figure 1 . Seven studies with 50 participants have been included. Mean age of pregnant women included in this metaanalysis was 30.82 years old (95% CI: 28.54 -33.10; Table 2 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

There was no significant study bias (Begg's test P=0.782, Egger's test P=1).
Fever had the highest overall prevalence among clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection of pregnant women. We achieved an overall fever prevalence of 77% (95%-CI, 57-93%; I 2 = 0%; Pheterogeneity = 0.62; Table 2 ), (Begg's test P=1, Egger's test P=0.852). The cough symptom was in the next rank with prevalence of 20% (95%-CI; 2-46%; I 2 = 31.6%; P-heterogeneity = 0.21; Table 2 ). There was no significant study bias (Begg's test P=0.624, Egger's test P=0.466).
We achieved an overall premature prevalence of 20% (95%-CI, 4-41%; I 2 = 28.67%; Pheterogeneity = 0.21; Table 2 & Fig.9 ) through the meta-analysis with 7 studies included. There was no significant study bias (Begg's test P=0.548, Egger's test P=0.434).
In this meta-analysis, we achieved an overall prevalence of more than 99% (95%-CI, 95-100%; I 2 = 0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.45; Table 2 In this meta-analysis, we achieved an overall prevalence of 61% (95%-CI, 32-87%; I 2 = 4.66%; Pheterogeneity = 0.37; The current meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of death, preeclampsia, asphyxia, malaise, rigor, diarrhea, chest pain and fatigue is zero among pregnant women ( Table 2) . We achieved an overall prevalence of 8%, 7%, 2%, 1%, 10% and 3% for PROM (Prelabor rupture of membranes), fetal distress, postpartum fever, myalgia, dyspnea and sore throat, respectively (Table 2 ).
The emergence of the epidemic raised concerns regarding pregnant women as high-risk individuals. The prevention and management of COVID-19 in pregnant women and the possible risk of vertical transmission become the main concern (9). This meta-analysis is the first study to achieve a comprehensive pattern of the COVID-19 clinical features in pregnant women. We included seven studies with a total of 50 patients from China. The mean age of pregnant patients was 30-year old and all were in third trimesters at the time of manifestation.
The most pregnant patients with COVID-19 manifested mild to moderate signs, commonly fever (77 %) and cough (20%). The other symptoms prevalence and biochemical characterization are similar to non-pregnant patients with 2019-nCov infection (12) . Respiratory viral diseases are indistinguishable from 2019-nCov infection due to nonspecific symptoms. To date, the laboratory tests have low specificity and cannot be used for definitive diagnosis of the COVID-19, and can only estimate the patient's clinical condition, therefore PCR and radiological studies will be performed to confirm the disease (12) .
This comprehensive study showed that the mortality rate is zero, although the sample size was limited. Also, there was no asphyxia, preeclampsia, rigor, malaise, chest pain, diarrhea and fatigue among pregnant women. However, differences in the quality of treatment in different countries (13) and virus genomic variation during spread (14) may cause these symptoms to show different rates elsewhere. In addition to the limiting number of studies included in this meta-analysis, another caveat is that all included studies were from China.
The results of four studies showed that 61% of the affected family members also had the disease.

Because of close contact with the patient's aerosols, the patient's family members are at greater risk.
This meta-analysis showed that all pregnant women underwent C-section. It is not clear that the vertical transmission risk of 2019-nCov in C-section is lower than vaginal delivery (15) . It seems that physicians think C-section is the better option for delivery. The surgery should be done in a negative-pressure operating room, and doctors should follow some protective measures like using a N95 mask, wearing a medical protective suit and goggles to avoid contamination with droplets from the surgical site (16) .
Our analysis showed that all pregnant women delivered live and healthy infants that were negative tested for 2019-nCov. This result indicates that the possibility of vertical transmission is very low, and performing intra-operative hygiene procedures and transferring the baby to an isolated ward will help to protect the baby from getting infected with COVID-19.
