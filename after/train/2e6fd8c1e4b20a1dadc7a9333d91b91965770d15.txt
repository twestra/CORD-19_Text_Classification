Whether a pathogen entering a new host species results in a single infection or in onward 7 transmission, and potentially an outbreak, depends upon the progression of infection in the index 8 case. Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, experimental inoculations of 9 pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich 10 and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen 11 determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of 514 12 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in 13 nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. 14 Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied 15 species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished 16 virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical 17 disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose 18 and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting 19 factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus 20 host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic 21 insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our 22 study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the 23 complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-24 species transmission.
Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host 27 species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species 28 for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies, 29 a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from 30 host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular, 31 disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel 32 host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to 33 explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental 34 inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index 35 infections in novel species. Features inherent to the virus lineage involved (virus effects), irrespective of the infected 91 host, likely due to adaptation of individual lineages to reservoir host species. For example, 92 incubation periods were shortened by both increased dose and by inoculation routes which were 125 closer to the brain, although the effect size estimate for inoculation distance included zero ( Figure  126 2A). More importantly, the duration of incubation periods was also influenced by features of the 127 virus as well as its interaction with the inoculated host. Specifically, significant differences in 128 incubation period duration were associated with reservoir type (bat vs. carnivore) and with body 129 temperature differences between source and inoculated hosts (Figure 2A ). Both effects depended 130 on viral dose. At low doses, viruses from bat reservoirs were associated with shorter incubation 131 periods compared to viruses from carnivores, though this effect diminished at higher doses ( Figure  132 2B). A similar effect was seen when the inoculated species was a known rabies reservoir ( Figure  133 2C) although the 95% highest posterior density interval (HPD) of this effect size included zero 134 ( Figure 2A ). The difference in typical body temperature between the virus reservoir and the 135 inoculated species had a more marked effect on incubation period durations ( Figure 2A ). The onset 136 of symptoms was delayed when the virus was inoculated into species with a warmer body 137 temperature than its reservoir (negative values in Figure 2D ), although this delay reduced with 138 higher doses. The opposite was also true -in hosts with lower body temperatures than the virus 139 reservoir, the incubation period tended to be shorter ( Figure 2D , Supplementary figure S 1). Models 140 fitting effects for inoculated and reservoir species body temperature separately allowed us to 141 explore this temperature effect further. Inoculated species with higher typical body temperatures 142 tended to have longer incubation periods (Supplementary figure S 2). However, viruses from 143 reservoirs with higher body temperatures were associated with shorter incubation periods, 144 suggesting that these viruses had adapted to counteract any losses in efficiency caused by the body 145 temperature of their reservoir host. Importantly, there was no correlation between phylogenetic 146 distance and body temperature difference among species (Supplementary figure S 3), indicating 147 that the observed temperature effects were not explainable by the level of taxonomic relatedness 148 among species. All fixed effects combined explained 19.2% of the variation in incubation period 149 durations (HPD: 2.8 -40.2%). 150
Clinical period 151 7 host species appeared to affect the duration of clinical periods. Cross-species inoculations between 156 phylogenetically more distant species were associated with an increased sensitivity to high viral 157 doses, resulting in shorter clinical periods ( Figure 2E ). However, the overall effect size estimate 158 for this interaction included zero (Figure 2A ). Bat-associated viruses appeared to have shorter 159 clinical periods, and -as also observed for incubation periods -this effect depended on dose, but 160 here it was poorly estimated, with the HPD again including zero ( Figure 2A ). All other fixed effects 161 were small, and none could be clearly separated from zero, but combined the fixed effects 162 explained 40.3% of the variation in clinical period duration (HPD: 12.9 -64.0%). accounted for by the inoculated species phylogeny ( Figure 3B ). The remaining residual correlation 176 is explained by differences in dose ( Figure 3C ), with higher doses leading to decreased salivary 177 gland titres ( Figure 3D ). The inoculation of species with a lower body temperature than the 178 reservoir also tended to reduce the virus titre in the salivary glands, although the size of this effect 179 could not be estimated precisely enough to make it distinct from zero (positive body temperature 180 differences, Figure 3D & E). A clearer effect was observed for the interaction of reservoir status 181 and dose: at low doses, known rabies reservoir species produced higher virus titres in the salivary 182 glands than non-reservoirs ( Figure 3G ). At very high doses, however, we detected no difference in 183 salivary gland titres, possibly because animals succumb too fast for any differences to develop. 184 .

By analysing 237 a unique dataset of experimental cross-species infections, we demonstrate that phylogenetic 238 distance and specific physiological differences between the host species involved alter the 239 progression of infections in ways that are expected to influence whether transmission in the novel 240 host is sustained. 241
The association between incubation period duration, the extent of centrifugal spread to other 242 tissues, and the amount of virus excreted suggests a direct mechanism linking longer incubation 243 periods to onward transmission. Species with higher body temperatures than the reservoir host 244 tended to have longer incubation periods, specifically at lower viral inoculation doses (Fig. 2D) . 245

Following cross-species transmission, 344 rabies virus shows increased virulence (i.e., more rapid death) in more distantly related species, to 345 the point that opportunities for transmission are likely to be markedly reduced. At the same time, 346 a mismatch in host physiological features (including features not strongly correlated with 347 phylogeny, such as body temperature) can alter both infectivity and disease progression, with 348 implications for onward transmission. Thus, the picture that emerges is one of a potential virulence 349 mismatch in index infections, that may explain why -despite having the ability to infect all 350 mammals and frequent involvement in cross-species transmission events -rabies virus remains 351 restricted to a relatively small number of species-specific maintenance cycles.

Differences between experiments were accommodated by including variables for dose, the 477 inoculation site, and whether the inoculum consisted of brain material or was derived from salivary 478 glands/saliva, along with a random effect distinguishing between experiments to accommodate any 479 remaining differences. Because the doses encountered in these experiments differed over several 480 orders of magnitude and the effects of increasing dose is assumed to decrease (saturate) at very 481 large doses, this variable was included in its log-transformed form. The varying inoculation routes 482 encountered were summarised as a 'proportional inoculation distance', representing the relative 483 distance between the inoculation site and the brain (the primary site of rabies virus replication). 484 as subcutaneous inoculations to the head, and were subsequently scaled to range between 0 642 (intracranial, head) and 1 (subcutaneous, head).
