Background 2
Obesity represents a global health threat, and is associated not only with exponentially 3 increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality, but with adverse clinical outcomes in 4 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well. Enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharides 5 to proteins (glycosylation) is highly responsive to numerous (patho)physiological conditions 6 and ageing, which is perhaps best exemplified on IgG. The prospect of immune age reduction, 7 by reverting induced glycosylation changes through metabolic intervention, opens many 8 possibilities. Herein, we have investigated whether weight loss interventions affect 9 inflammation-and ageing-related glycosylation alterations, in a longitudinal cohort of 10 bariatric-surgery patients. To support potential findings, BMI-related glycosylation changes 11 were monitored in a longitudinal TwinsUK cohort. 12
IgG and plasma N-glycans were chromatographically profiled in 37 obese patients, subjected 14 to low-calorie diet and then to bariatric surgery, across multiple timepoints. Similarly, plasma 15 glycome was analysed in 1,680 TwinsUK participants and longitudinally monitored during a 16
20-year follow-up. 17
Low-calorie diet induced marked increase in low branched and significant decrease in highly 19
branched, more complex plasma N-glycans -the change opposite to the one typically 20 observed in inflammatory conditions. Bariatric surgery resulted in extensive, gradual 21 alterations in IgG glycome, that accompanied progressive weight loss during one year follow-22 up. We observed significant increase in digalactosylated and sialylated, and substantial 23 decrease in agalactosylated and core fucosylated IgG glycans. In general, such IgG glycan 24 profile is associated with a younger biological age and reflects enhanced anti-inflammatory 25 IgG potential. The TwinsUK cohort replicated weight loss-associated agalactosylation decrease 26 and digalactosylation increase, estimated through BMI decrease over a 20-year-period. 27
Interpretation 28
Altogether, these findings highlight that weight loss substantially affects both plasma and IgG 29 N-glycosylation, resulting in improved biological and immune age.

The global prevalence of obesity has risen dramatically, to the point that it is now considered 56 of the EPIC-Potsdam cohort confirmed that changes in plasma N-glycome composition are 87 predictive of future CVD events, with comparable predictive power to the American Heart 88 Association (AHA) score in men and even better predictive power in women (16). The link 89 between an "old", proinflammatory IgG N-glycome and hypertension has also been 90 profoundly studied (17) (18) (19) , and similar IgG glycosylation patterns were associated with 91 increased body mass index (BMI) and measures of central adiposity (20, 21) . 92
Studies on mouse models further corroborate the importance of differential IgG glycoforms 93 in CVD pathogenesis. Namely, it has been shown that hyposialylated IgG (corresponding to an 94 "old" IgG glycome) can induce obesity-related hypertension and insulin resistance in B-cell-95 deficient mice, through activation of the endothelial FcγRIIB (22,23). These findings indicate 96 that the IgG N-glycome could represent more than a biomarker of inflammation and aging, 97 since distinctive IgG glycoforms act as effector molecules in certain pathologies. Furthermore, 98 supplementation with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a precursor of sialic acid, protects 99 obese mice from hypertension and insulin resistance induction by reverting an "old" IgG N-100 glycome into a "young" one (23,24). However, studies exploring the possibilities of converting 101 an "old" IgG glycome into a "young" one by metabolic intervention in humans are limited. Of 102 note, only one small study indicated that high-intensity interval training can "rejuvenate" the 103 IgG N-glycome (25). 104
Finally, severe obesity can be resolved only through bariatric surgery and subsequent weight 105 loss (26). The resulting weight loss impacts energy balance and metabolism, contributing to 106 the increased insulin response, improved glycaemic control and reduction of total body fat, 107 leading to decreased CVD risk and mortality (27) . In this study we aimed to determine whether 108 weight loss affects glycan markers related to inflammation and ageing, in a longitudinally-109 monitored cohort of obese individuals undergoing low-calorie diet and then bariatric surgical 110
interventions. In order to support potential findings, we also investigated the BMI-related 111 glycosylation changes in a longitudinal TwinsUK cohort. The analysis of samples obtained from 112 the largest longitudinal twins cohort in the UK allowed us to observe the changes of BMI in 113 relation to the IgG N-glycosylation alterations over time. 114

Patients were also excluded in case of pregnancy, active substance abuse or uncontrolled 124 psychiatric condition including eating disorders. Participants were sampled at baseline and 125 subjected to 3-week low calorie carbohydrate-restricted diet (900 cal, maximum 100 g of 126 carbohydrates per day), followed by bariatric surgery. The sequential follow-up timepoints 127 included the day of the surgery (baseline), after 6.54 ± 3.4 months (mean ± IQR) and 12.47 ± 128 6.55 months post-op. Characteristics of the bariatric cohort are shown in Table 1 . 129 TwinsUK cohort.

Bariatric cohort. In order to remove experimental variation from the measurements, 212 normalization and batch correction were performed on the UPLC glycan data. To make 213 measurements across samples comparable, normalization by total area was performed. Prior 214 to batch correction, normalized glycan measurements were log-transformed due to right-215 skewness of their distributions and the multiplicative nature of batch effects. Batch correction 216 was performed on log-transformed measurements using the ComBat method (R package sva 217 (30), where the technical source of variation (which sample was analysed on which plate) was 218 modelled as batch covariate. To correct measurements for experimental noise, estimated 219 batch effects were subtracted from log-transformed measurements. 220
Longitudinal analysis of patient samples through their observation period was performed by 221 implementing a linear mixed effects model, where time was modelled as fixed effect, while 222 the individual ID was modelled as random effect. Prior to the analyses, glycan variables were 223 all transformed to standard Normal distribution by inverse transformation of ranks to 224 Normality (R package "GenABEL", function rntransform). Using rank transformed variables 225 makes estimated effects of different glycans comparable, as these will have the same 226 standardized variance.

We profiled both plasma and IgG N-glycome in a cohort of bariatric surgery-candidate patients 251 at the beginning and at the end of their pre-operative diet. We calculated corresponding 252 derived glycan traits, which average particular glycosylation features. By employing a linear 253 mixed model, we observed ample changes in plasma N-glycome, as 10 out of 16 calculated 254 derived traits displayed significant alterations after the low-calorie diet. Namely, low 255 branched (LB), agalactosylated (G0), monogalactosylated (G1), asialylated (S0), 256 monosialylated (S1), core fucosylated (CF) and glycans bearing a bisecting GlcNAc (B) showed 257 a substantial increase in their abundances (Table 3) .

Using the same chromatographic approach, we profiled plasma protein N-glycome from 1,680 310
TwinsUK study participants sampled at several timepoints over a 20-year-period. This served 311 as a replication of the findings from the bariatric cohort, whose participants exhibited the 312 reversal from ''old'' to ''young'' IgG N-glycome due to weight loss. As these results showed 313 prominent changes in IgG composite glycan traits only, herein we focused on IgG glycosylation 314 changes. Due to the fact that for TwinsUK cohort plasma glycome was profiled, we calculated 315 derived traits and performed statistical analysis only on the first 11 glycan peaks, 316 corresponding to the glycans predominantly originating from IgG (32). Six derived traits were 317 calculated -agalactosylation (G0), monogalactosylation (G1), digalactosylation (G2), 318 incidence of bisecting GlcNAc (B), core fucosylation (CF) and incidence of high mannose 319 structures (HM). We examined IgG glycome alterations associated with changes in BMI using 320 a mixed model on a subset of 3,742 samples. Out of six examined IgG glycosylation features 321 .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20077867 doi: medRxiv preprint plasma and IgG N-glycome alterations in patients who underwent a low-calorie diet followed 354 by bariatric surgery. 355
Prior to bariatric surgery, patients were subjected to a low-calorie diet which caused 356 significant and extensive changes to the plasma protein N-glycome. The observed changes can 357 be summarized as significant increase in low-branched, biantennary structures (S0, S1, G0, 358 G1…) and, conversely, substantial decrease in high-branched, triantennary, more complex 359 structures (S3, G3). The glycosylation alterations induced by a low-calorie diet are showing 360 exactly the opposite direction of change than those seen in various inflammatory conditions, 361 such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel 362 disease (16,29,34,35), suggesting a gradual attenuation of inflammation. Interestingly, no 363 significant changes were found for the IgG N-glycome alone after the diet, probably due to 364 the relatively short follow-up period (3 weeks), which matches IgG serum half-life. Altogether, 365 our glycomic data suggest that the overall inflammatory body status improves after a short 366 time of low-calorie diet, reflecting a quickly noticeable and beneficial metabolic effect. 367
We have analysed both plasma and IgG N-glycome from individuals who underwent bariatric 369 surgery, in a longitudinal manner. We observed significant changes in both plasma and IgG N-370 glycome. In particular, plasma N-glycome showed significant alterations only in 371 agalactosylated (G0) glycans, whose abundance decreased during the follow-up period. Since 372 the majority of agalactosylated species in plasma originates from IgG (32), it is no surprise that 373 this glycosylation feature was also found to be significantly decreased in IgG glycome analysis. 374
Elevated levels of G0 IgG glycoforms are typically associated with aging, a pro-inflammatory 375
IgG glycan profile and various inflammatory diseases (11). On the other hand, the levels of 376 digalactosylated (G2) glycans increased after bariatric surgery and at sequential timepoints, in 377 accordance with a reduced inflammatory potential of the circulating IgG. Interestingly, the 378 increased levels of IgG galactosylation are associated with a younger biological age and are 379 considered, in a way, as a measure of an individual's well-being (14). Converesely, IgG 380 galactosylation levels substantially decrease with ageing and during inflammation (11,13). Our 381 results demonstrate that weight loss, resulting from bariatric surgery, can initiate the reversal 382 from an ''old'' to a ''young'' IgG N-glycome, potentially reversing the clock for the 383 immune/biological age. Furthermore, bariatric surgery also resulted in significant IgG glycome 384 alteration inducing a decrease in core fucosylation. The vast majority of circulating IgG 385 .

infections. This would suggest that an extensive weight loss ameliorates immune responses 389 dedicated to combat viral infections, by altering IgG glycosylation and modulating its effector 390 functions. Lastly, bariatric surgery-related weight loss led to an increase in IgG sialylation, 391 which is the main modulator of the IgG anti-inflammatory actions (37). In addition to its anti-392 inflammatory actions, the level of IgG sialylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 393 obesity-induced insulin resistance and hypertension, as already mentioned (22,23). Namely, 394
inhibitory IgG receptor FcγRIIB was found to be expressed in the microvascular endothelium. 395
Sequentially, it was shown that hyposialylated IgG acts as its operating ligand, leading to the 396 induction of obesity-related insulin resistance and hypertension. On the other hand, the 397 sialylated glycoform is not activating the signalling pathways responsible for the insulin 398 resistance and hypertension development, but is rather preserving insulin sensitivity and 399 normal vasomotor tone, even in obese mice. Interestingly, the same group made another 400 significant discovery -promotion of IgG sialylation breaks the link between obesity and 401 hypertension/insulin resistance (23,24). Namely, supplementation with the sialic acid 402 precursor restored IgG sialylation, highlighting a potential approach to improve both 403 metabolic and cardiovascular health in humans, with a single intervention. Our data suggest 404 that a similar effect might be achieved by weight loss interventions, through restoring of IgG 405 sialylation levels. Altogether, it is quite fascinating that such marked effects could be observed 406 on a rather small number of participants, which further highlights their significance in a given 407 biological setting. 408 409 Lastly, in order to confirm the effects of weight loss on the biological/immune age, we 410 investigated how BMI decrease affects IgG N-glycome during a 20-year-period. We observed 411 the prominent inverse changes of agalactosylated (G0) and digalactosylated (G2) IgG glycans. 412
Namely, agalactosylated IgG glycans significantly decreased, while digalactosylated ones 413 substantially increased as the BMI decreased. These observations corroborated our earlier 414 findings, confirming that the body weight reduction reverses IgG glycome from "old" to 415 "young", implying at the same time a likely reduction in the biological/ immune age. 416

Ideally, these 423 issues could be circumvented in the future studies whose experimental design would allow 424 the simultaneous, multi-centre follow-up of larger groups of patients. 425
Intense physical exercise can also shift IgG N-glycome towards a "younger" profile by 426
increasing IgG galactosylation (25). Although another study reported that prolonged intensive 427 exercise can have the opposite effect and promote pro-inflammatory changes of IgG N-428 glycome (38), its findings are not surprising since it recruited healthy, normal-weight female 429 participants, subjected to the intense energy deprivation and exercise levels, to induce 430 substantial fat loss in a rather short time period. The authors also highlighted that starting 431 weight and the way in which weight loss is achieved could be crucial for the final effect on the 432 immune system. Therefore, it seems that exercise overall has a positive impact on the immune 433 system and biological clock, but its intensity and duration should be personalized in order to 434 provide the optimal results. 435
To summarize, our results indicate that weight loss has impact on inflammation and biological 436 aging by altering plasma and IgG N-glycosylation patterns. Glycosylation changes can be 437 reliably quantified and used to estimate the "age" of the immune system. This could represent 438 a valuable tool in the context of COVID-19 patient stratification.
