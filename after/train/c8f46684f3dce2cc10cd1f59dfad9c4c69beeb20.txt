The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. Arizona of an individual with travel history (3 rd case in the US) (1). Here, we report on early 24 SARS-CoV-2 sentinel surveillance in Tempe, Arizona (USA). Genomic characterization 25
identified an isolate encoding a 27 amino acid in-frame deletion in accessory protein ORF7a, 26 the ortholog of SARS-CoV immune antagonist ORF7a/X4. 27
In anticipation of COVID-19 spreading in the state of Arizona, we initiated a surveillance effort 28 for local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 starting January 24, 2020. We leveraged an ongoing 29 influenza surveillance project at Arizona State University (ASU) Health Services in Tempe, 30
Arizona. Individuals presenting with respiratory symptoms (ILI) were tested for influenza A and 31 B virus (Alere BinaxNOW). Subsequently, we tested influenza-negative nasopharyngeal (NP) 32 swabs for SARS-CoV-2. We extracted total nucleic acid using the bioMérieux eMAG automated 33 platform and performed real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays specific for SARS-CoV-2 N and E 34 genes (2, 3). Out of 382 NP swabs collected from January 24, 2020 to March 25, 2020, we 35 detected SARS-CoV-2 in 5 swabs in the week of March 16 to 19 (Figure 1 ). This corresponds 36 to prevalence of 1.31%. Given the estimated 1 -14-day incubation period for COVID-19, it is 37 possible that the spike in cases might be related to university spring-break holiday travel (March 38 8 -15) as previously seen in other outbreaks (4, 5). 39
To understand the evolutionary relationships and characterize the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we 40 performed next-generation sequencing (Illumina NextSeq, 2x76) directly on specimen RNA, 41 thereby avoiding cell culture passage and potentially associated mutations. This generated an 42 NGS dataset of 20.7 to 22.7 million paired-end reads per sample. We mapped quality-filtered 43 reads to a reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947) using BBMap (version 39.64) to 44 generate three full-length genomes: AZ-ASU2922 (376x coverage), AZ-ASU2923 (50x) and AZ-45 ASU2936 (879x) (Geneious prime version 2020.0.5). We aligned a total of 222 SARS-CoV-2 46 genome sequences comprising at least 5 representative sequences from phylogenetic lineages 47 .

We performed phylogenetic reconstruction with BEAST (version 1.10.4, strict 49 molecular clock, HKY + Γ nucleotide substitution, exponential growth for coalescent model) (7-50 10). The ASU sequences were phylogenetically distinct indicating that they were independent 51 transmissions (Figure 2A) . 52
Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes multiple open reading frames in the 3' 53 region. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 AZ-ASU2923 genome has an 81 base-pair deletion in 54 the ORF7a gene resulting in a 27 amino-acid in-frame deletion ( Figure 2B) . The SARS-CoV 55
ORF7a ortholog is a viral antagonist of host restriction factor BST-2/Tetherin and induces 56 apoptosis (11) (12) (13) (14) . Based on the SARS-CoV ORF7a structure (15), the 27-aa deletion in SARS-57
CoV-2 ORF7a maps to the putative signal peptide (partial) and first two beta strands. To 58 validate the deletion, we performed RT-PCR using primers spanning the region and verified by 59 .
