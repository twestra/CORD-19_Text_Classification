It is an urgent priority to 9 better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of 10 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic 11 stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key 12 factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane 13 fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like 14 motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-15 CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. 16 Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during 17 pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target 18 PP2A in order to manipulate host's antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that 19 SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute 20 inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight 21 covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a 22 target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.

The surface-located SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S (S) is a 1273 amino acid residues. It is a 44 homotrimeric, multidomain, and integral membrane protein that give coronaviruses the appearance 45 of having crowns (Corona in Latin) (Li, 2016) . It is a key piece of viral host recognition (receptor-46 recognition) and organ tropism and induces strongly the host immune reaction (Li, 2015) . It is 47 subdivided to S1 subunit that binds to a receptor on the host cell surface and S2 subunit that permits 48 viral and host membranes fusion. S1 subunit is divided into two domains, an N-terminal domain 49 (NTD) and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that can function as viral receptors-50 binding (Li, 2012) . In addition, S1 subunit is normally more variable in sequence among different 51 CoVs than is the S2 subunit (Masters, 2006) .

The human B56 family consists of at least five different 59 members (α, β, γ, δ and ε). Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro- Interestingly, 293 LDPLSET 299 is only present in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A) . It is absent in the other 81 coronaviruses S protein analysed in this study. In order to interact with protein(s), 293 LDPLSE 298 82 must be present at the surface of S1 subunit. Indeed, it is exposed in the surface of S1 subunit in The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020941 doi: bioRxiv preprint
