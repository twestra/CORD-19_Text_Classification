Objective: To determine the long-term clinical problems in adult survivors of coronavirus (CoV) infection [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)] after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
[prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term.
of each outcome. Where estimates were only provided separately for 2 or more subgroups, we took the weighted average across those subgroups as the estimate for the overall population. Extraction was undertaken by at least two independent authors and further cross-checked by two more authors.
Studies were graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool [ Table 1] 8 . The initial level of evidence was assigned depending on the type of study.
Prospective cohort studies were then graded down if follow-up rate was <80%. Prospective cohort study with good follow-up (>80%) Level 1c
All or none case-series Level 2a
Systematic review of retrospective cohort study Level 2b
Prospective cohort study with follow-up (<80%) or Retrospective cohort study Level 2c
Ecological studies Level 3a
Systematic Review of Non-consecutive cohort study or very limited population Level 3b
Non-consecutive cohort study Level 4
Case-series Level 5 Expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, or based on physiology, bench research or "first principles"
Binary data for prevalence of outcomes were pooled using meta-analysis by mixed-effects logistic regression. Mean scores for different outcomes were pooled in a meta-analysis using random effects models 9 . Forest plots were stratified by duration of follow-up (up to 6 months and over 6 months).
Where a study presented more than one result within a subgroup, we selected the value closest to 6 months (for up to 6 months) or to 12 months (for over 6 months). Between-study heterogeneity was assessed as the range of study estimates, and the proportion of total variability attributable to between-study 10 . There were too few studies to formally explore the sources of heterogeneity through meta-regression (e.g. by mean age, disease, % male, or level of evidence) or examine potential small-study effects such as publication bias through funnel plots. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 11 .

1169 studies were identified from the databases. Of these 104 abstracts were selected for full-text screening and finally 28 included in the review. The reasons for exclusion of the studies have been reported in Figure 1 . The studies mainly addressed one or more of 5 key outcomes of interest -Lung function (18 studies), mental health (6 studies), exercise tolerance (5 studies), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (5 studies), ocular (1 study) and neuromuscular outcomes (1 study).

Results from Ong et al. (2004) 30 were not included because they only reported outcomes from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and did not conduct 6-minute walking distance (6MWD). The pooled estimate of 6MWD for 3 studies reporting outcomes up to 6 months was 461.18 (95% Confidence Interval 449.66 to 472.71).
The 6MWD increased substantially after 6 months with pooled estimate of 533.00 (95% Confidence Interval 449.66 to 472.71). Since ~30 m is considered to be the minimal clinically important difference in 6MWD 41 , patients seem to improve significantly overtime. Unfortunately, data was not available regarding the 6MWD for participants before CoV infection and therefore there is no report of the number of patients with exercise tolerance lower than baseline.

All studies which reported prevalence of these psychological conditions had follow-up period of longer than 6 months. As a result, meta-analysis was conducted for prevalence beyond 6 months only [ Figure 6 Figure 6 and Figure 7 ]. We could not perform meta-analysis on the mean scores for different psychological comorbidities because different scales were used by different studies to report these.

Out of these, only 3 studies, which reported both mean and SD, were included in the meta-analysis of short form 36 health survey (SF-36) [ Figure 8 and 9] and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)
[ Figure 10 ] each. The pooled analysis showed that the mean score for all of the 8 domains of the SF-36 were substantially lower in CoV survivors than normative values for people who are healthy as well as for people with chronic diseases derived from existing validated literature 42 [ Figure 9 ]. Domains which scored particularly lower than healthy individuals and those chronic conditions were role limitations due to physical and emotional health. There seems to be some improvement in these domains beyond 6 months, but the scores were still lower than healthy and chronic disease patients 42 .

Other outcomes which have been followed-up in SARS patients have been reported in Table 6 . The study by Yuen et al. (2004) 39 found no eye pathologies in this cohort. The case-series by Tsai et al. (2004) 40 followed up patients who developed limb weakness related to critical illness neuropathy (CIN) and myopathy (CIM) and sensory deficits following infection. All these patients had a partial or full recovery of muscle power 3 months after admission.
The long-term complications of coronavirus infection are not well understood. The prevalence, severity and prognosis of these complications must be determined to plan the rehabilitation of survivors of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review collates these long-term complications seen following previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) in those who required hospitalisation or ICU stay. Our findings highlighted that the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured using SF-36, is considerably reduced in CoV survivors at 6 months postinfection, shows only slight improvement beyond 6 months and remains below normal population and those with chronic conditions [ Figure 9 ]. As these SF-36 scores reflect impairment in physical, mental and social functioning of well-being, it is not surprising that the key areas of impairments identified in our systematic review were pulmonary dysfunction, reduced exercise tolerance and psychological problems.
Respiratory compromise is one of the key physical issues in survivors. The impairment is mainly restrictive in nature with predominance of abnormalities in DLCO, VC and TLC compared to FEV1, thereby, supporting the etiopathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome with parenchymal infiltration caused by the infection. Even though lung function improves over time, the results from our meta-analysis showed that reduction in DLCO may still be present in 11 to 45% of CoV survivors at 12 months. This is consistent with CT findings of other studies which have reported that pulmonary fibrosis can persist up to 7 years 29 . Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve QoL in other patients with fibrosis 43 but it is unknown whether this would be effective in COVID-19 survivors.
CoV survivors had reduced aerobic capacity with peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) testing showing impairments in 41% of patients at 3 months 30 . This could be due to circulatory limitation, muscle weakness, critical illness neuropathy and myopathy (CINM) and deconditioning 30 . The 6MWD
is also reduced at 3 months and slowly improves by 12 months 44, 45 . We know from other literature that such chronic weakness may be present in patients even 5 years after ICU admission, therefore, rehabilitation needs of these patients can be prolonged 46 .

Our meta-analysis showed that around a third of CoV survivors may have psychological conditions such as PTSD, depression and anxiety beyond 6 months. These estimates are much higher than the prevalence of these conditions reported as part of post-ICU syndrome in medical and surgical patients 48 . This indicates that the long-lasting mental health impact is not from serious illness alone, but also from factors such as fear 49 , stigma 37 and quarantine 50 , all of which also apply to COVID-19 51 . The main strength of this study is that it highlights multiple long-term biopsychosocial impairments which may hinder return to pre-infection functional status. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on this topic as far as we are aware. Unlike a previous review from 2003 7 , we investigated long-term outcomes from major SARS and MERS outbreaks this century. We have tried to capture the various aspects of well-being and health-related quality of life in CoV survivors.
There are understandably no studies on the long-term effects of COVID-19 as the outbreak was first reported only in Dec 2019. Considering SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same virus family and has led to a more rapid spread with greater mortality worldwide 1 , the aftereffects are predicted to be similar, if not more profound and demanding of healthcare resources long term. For example, the widely reported prevalence of coagulopathy and thrombotic disease in COVID-19 patients may result in new end-organ complications and respiratory recovery could conceivably be affected 53 , thereby, leading to worse outcomes long-term.
Finally, there was also a paucity of information following up SARS and MERS survivors. Many studies had a small sample size and some outcomes could not be quantified because of limited number of studies reporting these. There was substantial heterogeneity, with almost all I-squared estimates >50%. We were unable to formally explore sources of this heterogeneity because of the small All rights reserved.

Differences in outcomes between ICU and non-ICU patients remain unclear. Whilst one study identified that lung function parameters like FVC and DLCO were comparatively lower in ICU group 15 , another reported no significant difference between the two groups 30 . Further reporting of outcomes in ICU CoV survivors would be crucial as muscle weakness developed during ICU admissions has been associated with substantial impairments in physical function and quality of life 54 . Therefore, coronavirus survivors who required ICU will likely have even worse outcomes.
The global community of rehabilitation and mental healthcare services need to address the long-term complications identified in this review very early in the COVID-19 pandemic recovery phase.
Acute rehabilitation during hospital stay requires active involvement of multidisciplinary teams to ensure the physical, psychological and social aspects are met. Post-acute early rehabilitation in the first 3 months after discharge is critical to prevent emerging issues such as reduced exercise tolerance and depression. Long-term rehabilitation must be an ongoing process to ensure individual function and biopsychosocial profiles are restored as much as possible so these individuals can return to previous societal roles and start contributing successfully to economies. This will determine whether the healthcare services around the globe have successfully managed the long-term impact of this pandemic.
