Introduction: COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with comorbidities and the elderly.
Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition amongst COVID-19 patients.
Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is common in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. It is unknown whether RAAS inhibition with ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can be harmful or beneficial.
Among 3017 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1584 (52.5%) carried a diagnosis of hypertension. In the discharged or deceased cohort, the overall mortality was significantly increased at 35% vs 13% among COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, when adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was greatly diminished, with a reduction in odds-ratio by over half; and completely disappeared when adjusted for other major covariates.
The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses. RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (p=0.001).
Conclusions: While our results are limited by the retrospective nature of our study and by potential confounders, our data argue against a harmful effect of RAAS inhibition and support the HFSA/AHA/ACC joint statement recommending continuing ACE1 and ARB therapy in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.

Elderly patients, especially with comorbid conditions, have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent in COVID-19. Hypertension is the most common preexisting condition among COVID-19 patients and early reports note an association between hypertension and increased mortality. 1 Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) occurs in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. 2 The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on epithelial cells of the lungs, intestines and kidneys. Subsequent downregulation of surface ACE2 results in accumulation of angiotensin II (ANGII) with effects on vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis. 2, 3 Pharmacologic inhibition of RAAS with ACE1 inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) increase ACE2 expression and could be harmful or beneficial. 4 Given these concerns, physicians may be tempted to alter anti-hypertensive therapy during COVID-19, although abrupt withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors has been associated with cardiac instability in patients with cardiomyopathies. 5

We performed a retrospective, multicenter, convenience sampling study of patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 within the Hackensack Meridian Health network, the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were manually abstracted from electronic health records. Institutional review board approval was obtained for the database, but subject informed consent was waived as analysis was conducted on secondary use de-identified data. Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression were performed.

The Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), American Heart Association (AHA) and
American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a joint statement recommending continued use of ACE1 and ARB inhibitors in hypertensive patients with COVID-19. 6 Our retrospective realworld review of hospitalized patients found that hypertension did not worsen mortality when corrected for age and other key factors. We did not identify harmful effects of RAAS inhibition and there was a suggestion of possible benefit. There is evidence that hypertensive COVID-19 patients have higher ANGII levels contributing to a pro-inflammatory state. 4 Therefore, ACE1s
and ARBs, which decrease ANGII production or antagonize its action by blocking its receptor, might suppress the inflammatory state of COVID-19. 4 A Chinese retrospective report also noted lower in-hospital mortality with RAAS inhibitors compared to other anti-hypertensive agents. 3 While our results are limited by the retrospective nature of our study, our data argue against a harmful effect of RAAS inhibition and support the HFSA/AHA/ACC joint statement recommending the continuation of ACE1 and ARB therapy in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.
