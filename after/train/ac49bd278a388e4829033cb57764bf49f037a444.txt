Here, Cas13a has been used to target and mitigate influenza virus A (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic mRNA-based platform. CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) against PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 were screened in conjunction with mRNA-encoded Cas13a. Screens were designed such that only guides that decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13-mediated fashion, were valid. Cas13a mRNA and validated guides, delivered post-infection, simulating treatment, were tested in combination and across multiplicities of infection. Their function was also characterized over time. Similar screens were performed for guides against SARS-CoV-2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect. Last, the approach was utilized in vivo, demonstrating the ability to degrade influenza RNA in a mouse model of infection, using polymer-formulated, nebulizer-based mRNA delivery.
Our findings demonstrate the applicability of Cas13a in mitigating respiratory infections both in vitro and in a mouse model, paving the way for future therapeutic use.
There are 219 species of viruses that are known to infect humans 1 of which, 214 are RNA viruses 2 . It is estimated that viral infections contribute to approximately 6.6% of global mortality 3 . This is especially concerning, given that there are approximately 90 drugs (since 1963-2016) to treat only 9 viral species 4 . In addition, there are approved vaccines for only 15 viral species. Reassortment, antigenic shift and drift, for influenza, as well as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) for SARS and possibly, SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges to vaccine development 5 6 . These factors likely contribute to epidemics and pandemics. Human health is thus under constant threat due to emerging and reemerging viral infections 7 . Outbreaks of Zika 8 , Ebola 9 , and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 10 , and the potential for future influenza pandemics 11 , warrant the development of new classes of anti-viral drugs 4 . Current drug development is focused on small molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which require high doses or frequent re-dosing to obtain functional outcomes 12, 13 . Thus, it is crucial to address the need for antivirals that are broad spectrum, flexible and effective across multiple viral species or strains.
The discovery of a RNA targeting, class II -type VI CRISPR-Cas system in bacteria has engendered tremendous interest for potential applications. The Cas13a: crRNA complex activates when the target RNA (trRNA) complements with crRNA, and the Cas protein initiates RNA cleavage 14, 15 , due to the higher eukaryote and prokaryote nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain 16 . This property has been used to detect specific transcripts in mixtures of nucleic acids 15 . The specific RNase activity of Cas13a and Cas13d 17 was also used to knockdown endogenous genes, and more recently, two groups have demonstrated the ability of Cas13b or Cas13d to degrade influenza RNA 18, 19 .

In each case, Cas13 was expressed at least 24 hrs prior to infection. This prior work was clearly useful to demonstrate proof of principle.
Here we examined crucial steps towards using this approach as a treatment for respiratory viral infections. Given the advantages of transient expression for treating infections, we developed synthetic mRNA to express LbuCas13a both with and without an NLS sequence, as influenza RNA can be localized to both compartments at different times post-infection, and both constructs were tested for function within intube assays. Why synthetic mRNA? Synthetic mRNA expression is transient, has very little chance of integrating, and innate immune responses can be mitigated through sequence design, modified nucleotides, and purification [20] [21] [22] . In addition, given The mRNA-based approach was initially benchmarked by examining knockdown of endogenous genes, using previously published target regions 10 . In examining these genes, and expanding the number of controls used, it was found that not all knockdown of RNA was mediated by Cas13a. A number of controls was needed to ensure that the knockdown was Cas13a mediated, and that enzymatic action was occurring. Once it was determined which controls were important, guides against PB1 were screened via qPCR, given post-infection, simulating a treatment strategy. Why polymerase genes? They are more highly conserved, and without (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

A potent guide against PB1 mRNA was found using this approach but guides with broader sequence homology across flu strains were sought. By first examining homology among 108 vaccine strains, a stretch of nucleotides in PB2 were found to overlap most H1N1 strains, the H1N1 pandemic strain from 2009, and H3N2 strains used in prior vaccines.
Vaccine strains are a benchmark for circulating strain variation over time and thus good candidates. At least two potent guides against this sequence were found. Subsequent tests post-infection included combining guides, and time-course studies yielding potent knockdown of influenza RNA. We then asked whether this same approach could be used against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current pandemic.
Here, we delivered the mRNA prophylactically, as the virus is especially potent in VeroE6 cells, and cytopathic effect (CPE) was used as the metric for success. Here we demonstrate clear mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 CPE.
Last, we demonstrated that this approach has translational potential by delivering Cas13 mRNA and guides formulated with a PBAE-based polymer 25 via nebulizer post-influenza infection, simulating treatment. At day 3 post infection, degradation of influenza RNA in the lung was evaluated demonstrating robust knockdown. Overall, we feel that we have demonstrated the necessity of controls for designing crRNAs, the possibility of pan-influenza targeting of viral strains, and the ability to target relevant and emergent respiratory pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo.

Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS RNA cleavage generated fluorescence increased to its maximum during the initial 10-and 20-min period, respectively, and then gradually decreased over time, likely due to photobleaching. The overall trend of RNA cleavage was similar for both the Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS (Fig. 1b) . Our results indicate that in vitro translated Cas13a mediated RNA cleavage is specific and occurred only when both the crRNA and trRNA were present. In addition, when a non-target crRNA (NTCR) was used along with the trRNA, no RNA cleavage was observed, thus demonstrating crRNAspecific cleavage of trRNA by Cas13a (Fig, 1b) . Overall, the mRNAs designed express functional Cas13 proteins.
In order to more fully validate the mRNA-based approach, mRNA expressing LbuCas13a, with and without an NLS, and guides targeting PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS endogenous genes were tested, and gene knockdown evaluated at 24 hours via qPCR ( Fig. 2a-c and Supplementary Table 2) .

To date, most studies only evaluate targeted reduction of RNA relative to the reduction due to a NTCR. Two additional controls were added, a mRNA expressing a "dead" or inactive Cas13a plus targeted guide, and a GFP encoding mRNA plus targeted guide. Each control yielded valuable information regarding how the guide was performing. The dead version gives insight into whether "binding-only" events may affect RNA levels, while the GFP control adds additional information regarding whether the guide alone has knockdown effects. If all the controls do not affect RNA levels and knockdown is only due to the active enzyme, then enzymatic action is driving the reduction. There are cases where the Cas13a inactive version may also decrease RNA levels ( Fig. 2 b) . This is not necessarily a problem per se, but this control group helps distinguish "binding" related knockdown from enzymatic effects. All this information is important for establishing the mode of action of this therapeutic approach.
For PPIB, the controls in general acted as expected, though there was some effect of the NTCR in the NLS case. The PPIB guides exhibited 57% and 53% knockdown via the cytosolic and NLS versions of LbuCas13a in 24 hrs, respectively ( Fig. 2a) . For CXCR4, unfortunately, the guides themselves, using published spacer sequences, without Cas13a expression, significantly knocked down the mRNA by over 90% (Fig. 2b) . For KRAS, this did not occur, and instead the guides exhibited Cas13 mediated knockdown, 38% and 60%, via the cytosolic and NLS versions of LbuCas13a in 24 hrs, respectively (Fig. 2c) . The data resulting from the CXCR4 experiments were surprising, but clearly demonstrated the need for the additional controls when screening guides against specific RNAs to ensure Cas13 mediated knockdown.

Next, six PB1 guides targeting both the genome and mRNA were designed and screened post-infection (Supplementary Table 2 Expanding the breath of guides against influenza: targeting PB2.
Clearly, for this approach to have high therapeutic value, the ability to target many strains of a given virus is advantageous. For influenza, a bioinformatic comparison of 108 influenza historical vaccine strains and candidate vaccine strains, with publicly available genome sequences, yielded a number of conserved regions across different subsets of strains (Fig. 4) . We specifically focused on our so-called "Human" subset, which included human seasonal H1N1, H1N1pdm09, and human seasonal H3N2 strains. From this analysis, a conserved region in PB2 was found, and six guides were designed against both viral mRNA and the genome of influenza Fig 2) .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.060418 doi: bioRxiv preprint exhibited over 75% knockdown at the RNA level ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 2) These two guides were examined for breadth, and when the combination was compared with over 52,000 strains downloaded from , over the last 100 years, they were exact matches with 99.1% of strains (Fig. 4 e,f) . This result was very encouraging towards the goal of a pan-influenza approach.
The mRNA targeted guides for PB1 and PB2 were then combined with both cytoplasmic and NLS targeted Cas13a and the combination was evaluated both as a function of MOI and over-time (Fig. 6) . The use of the combination NLS and cytoplasmic Cas13a is justified by the variability of the distribution of viral RNPs from cell to cell (Supplementary Fig 3) . First, when the combination was evaluated, in our standard screening assay, we clearly saw the benefits of the combination, yielding ~10% lower RNA values than with WSN33_PB1_m5 alone. When this combination was examined across MOI, it was clear that at MOI=0.001 and 0.01, > than 80% knockdown was achievable, where at MOI=0.1, the effect was only ~25% (Fig 6. a-b) .
The effect though, may be increased if the enzymatic reaction is given more time, and if the dose of mRNA and guide is increased. When the combination was evaluated over time, at MOI=0.01, the results demonstrated continued RNA reduction over a span of 72 hours (Fig 6. c-d) , with the peak difference from IAV and the NTCR at 48 hours. It should be noted that we did see increased effects of the NTCR over time, likely due to low levels of NTCR overlap with native genes inducing activation.
However, if the effect of the treatment or "drug", Cas13a mRNA+targeted guide, is (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Given the current importance of SARS-CoV-2, a set of crRNAs that target highly conserved regions in the replicase and nucleocapsid regions of the genome were designed ( Fig. 7 This was repeated in 6 well plates using both individual and combinations of guides including all the controls, and the data quantified by image analysis, demonstrating for the combination of N3.2 and N11.2 over 72% reduction in cell death with over 80% of cells remaining in the plate. Overall, this bodes well for use as a therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2.

In order to test this approach in vivo, we first had to develop both an apparatus and formulation for the RNA for nebulizer-based delivery. We designed a straightforward nose-cone nebulizer apparatus (Fig. 8a) , which allows for 3 mice to be dosed simultaneously from a vibrating mesh nebulizer. PBAE was chosen for our formulation based on prior publication and lung delivery 25 . First, the final concentration of mRNA in the formulation was optimized using a GPI-anchored nanoluciferase (aNLuc) encoding mRNA in the lung (Fig. 8b) , yielding optimal expression in the lungs at 0.5 Âµg/ml, as reported previously. Next, we determined whether influenza infection affects delivery. We infected mice with 3 LD50 of Influenza A/WSN/33 and then delivered aNLuc mRNA at 12 and 24 hrs post-infection as well as without infection ( Fig. 8c-d) . No significant differences in expression were observed, demonstrating efficient mRNA delivery and protein expression via nebulizer in the face of influenza infection.
In order to test this treatment approach, mice were infected with 3 LD50 of Analysis revealed a 89.1% (p=0.0097) reduction of viral RNA from NTCR and a 96.2% (p=0.0001) from IAV only, demonstrating robust knockdown of viral RNA in vivo.

RNA viruses pose challenges for drug and vaccine development and thus are a global health concern. Unconventional molecular tools like RNA-activated RNases, such as Cas13a, could be a potential new paradigm for therapeutics against these pathogens. However, for the RNA targeting RNases to be safe and effective for therapeutic use, rapid, transient expression is preferred 27 . To achieve this, we opted for synthetic in vitro transcribed mRNA to express Cas13a. mRNA has the advantage of rapid translation of the desired protein and clearance, while it avoids safety concerns such as genome integration and unmitigated innate immune responses 20, 21, [28] [29] [30] .
Using this all RNA-based approach, we found crRNA guides that targeted both the genome and the mRNA of influenza effectively, even when given 24 hours post-infection. To date, this is the first demonstration that this approach can be used post-infection. There was, though, a clear bias towards mRNA targeted guides, which is consistent with prior work using siRNA against influenza 31 . In addition, even though we were not able to find guides that were truly pan-influenza, they clearly overlap with over 52,000 strains, making significant strides towards this goal. Prior studies had not targeted polymerase genes. It is our contention that they are excellent targets due to their clear role in generating viral RNA and the fact they are so well conserved. We also demonstrated for the first time, how this approach scales with MOI and is functional over a 3-day period even when using transient transfection of mRNA.
The time course data demonstrated the ability of Cas13a to degrade RNA at a rate equal to or more rapidly than the rate of RNA generation from viral replication. This has not been addressed to date. The data clearly shows that over the 3-day period (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In the future, we will address how dose effects these dynamics and how this may change with Cas13b or d.
We then addressed the question; can this approach be rapidly applied directly to newly emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2? From our results, it is clear that Cas13a can have significant effects on CPE, a well-established measure of antiviral activity 32 . These results clearly demonstrate the adaptability of this approach and its flexibility. Different guide sequences are sufficient to target either IAV or SARS-CoV-2. By delivering the nuclear or the cytoplasmic versions of Cas13, or both together, the replication and dynamics of different viruses can be significantly impacted. Given the promising results in vitro for SARS-CoV-2, this approach will be moved into animal models in the very near future. Due to the need for ABSL3, and the fact that the animal models are not yet mature, we did not pursue these experiments at this juncture.
Last, we answered a critical question regarding Cas13, can it be used in vivo?
Here we formulated the mRNA with PBAE-based polymer previously demonstrated by the Anderson lab 25 and delivered it post-infection using a vibrating-mesh style nebulizer that is currently used by humans, simulating a treatment strategy, and demonstrated that Cas13 can degrade viral RNA in vivo efficiently. This is the first demonstration of Cas13 use in an animal model of infection and it bodes well for treating other infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. Given we have guides that were effective in vitro, we have confidence that we can move this to an appropriate animal model such as ferrets or hamsters. This will be a very important step towards developing a Cas13 based treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Future work will (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Overall, this work demonstrates significant progress toward the use of this of Cas13 to treat respiratory viral infections.
The Cas13a sequence from Leptotrichia buccalis was obtained from Addgene p2CT-His-MBP-Lbu_C2C2_WT (Plasmid #83482). We cloned the wild type Cas13a with a 3' V5 tag (Cas13a-V5) and appended a 3' UTR from mouse alpha-globin (Genbank accession # NM_001083955) in a pMA7 vector (GeneArt, Thermo Scientific, USA). Additionally, we synthesized a construct with the Cas13a sequence from the Leptotrichia buccalis along with a nuclear localization sequence (at 3' and 5') and a 3' V5 tag to create a Cas13a-V5-NLS version using GeneBlocks (Integrated DNA technologies). For both constructs, we synthesized catalytically-inactive versions (dCas13a -V5 and dCas13a-V5-NLS). The sequences were obtained by Addgene plasmid#100817. The sequences of the GPI anchor and nanoluciferase are described in Lindsay et al 33 .
Plasmids were linearized with Not-I HF (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37Â°C. Linearized templates were purified by sodium acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) precipitation and rehydrated with nuclease free water. IVT was performed overnight at 37Â°C using the HiScribe T7 kit (NEB) following the manufacturer's instructions (N1methyl-pseudouridine modified).

The RNA was heat denatured at 65Â°C for 10 minutes before capping with a Cap-1 structure using guanylyl transferase and 2'-Omethyltransferase (Aldevron). mRNA was then purified by lithium chloride precipitation, treated with alkaline phosphatase (NEB) and purified again. mRNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop. mRNA stock concentrations were 1-3 mg/ml. Purified mRNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to ensure purity. crRNA guides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) or Genscript. The sequences are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 .
In order to demonstrate that mRNA-expressed Cas13a efficiently encodes for a fully functional enzyme able to cleave a target RNA in a "in tube" assay, Cas13a mRNA was translated in vitro using the Rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to Table 1) 15 . This mixture was added cold to the translated Cas13a lysate (5 Âµl) in the 96-well plate wells and mixed well. All the reagent preparations and additions were performed on ice. The fluorescence measurements (excitation 485Â±20 nm/emission 528 Â± 20 nm) were recorded at room temperature for 90 min at 10 min interval.
