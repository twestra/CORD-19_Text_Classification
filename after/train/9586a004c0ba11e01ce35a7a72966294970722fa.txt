Objective: many potential factors contribute to the outbreak of COVID-19.It aims to explore the effects of various meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19. Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results:
Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358).The negative correlations included average .

The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1 , the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion:
Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure. The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.
i n a / 2 5 even death (Huang et al.,2020) . Men over 80 years old and patients with complications are associated with an increased risk of death, and the characteristics of the dead patients are very consistent with MuLBSTA (Chen et al.,2020) . The WHO's research and development blueprint and the global organization for infectious disease prevention and control research cooperation (GLOPID-R) have determined to give priority to the study of virus pathogenesis and clinical characteristics, prevention and control of infection and plans for candidate therapies (GloPID-R,2020) .
Respiratory virus infection can occur in the following ways:(a) direct/indirect contact, (b) droplet spray in short-distance transmission, or (c) long-distance transmission by aerosol ,i.e. air transmission (Brankston et al.,2007) . Research shows that COVID-19 is transmitted through direct contact or droplets (Chan et al.,2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang et al.2020 ) while air transmission is not excluded (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Environmental factors affect host susceptibility by regulating respiratory tract defense mechanism, and affect the viability and transmission of respiratory tract viruses in the environment through aerodynamic mechanism.
Human behavior will affect the contact rate between infected individuals and susceptible individuals. Both epidemiology and laboratory studies show that meteorological indicators are important factors for the transmission and survival of respiratory tract infection viruses (enveloped and non-enveloped viruses) (Chan et al. 2011; Ma et al.,2020; Shaman & Kohn, 2009; Xie & Zhu.,2020; Yao et al.,2020; Yuan et al.,2006; Yusuf et al.,2007) . In particular, it is unclear that the meteorological factors how to influence on the activity of 2019-nCoV, and then change the spread of the virus through a specific process, and to affect the morbidity. However, we believe that the relationship between meteorological factors and the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the mechanism of meteorological factors on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV, are of practical significance to prevent and control the epidemic disease, especially the nosocomial infection and community transmission, and to predict the extinction of the virus.
Due to the different characteristics of virus transmission in different latitudes, Hubei province is used instead of China or Wuhan city with appropriate spatial resolution (that is, at the provincial level rather than at the national level, nor at the municipal level), and analysis of observation data is of much concern for understanding the global durability of viruses and formulating appropriate prevention and control measures.

Here, the above two days are outliers and are eliminated in correlation analysis and regression analysis.

If linear regression results cannot be obtained, generalized linear regression is considered. Table 1 summarizes the basic statistical results of incremental cases and meteorological parameters. As of March 10, 2020, there are 67773 confirmed cases in Hubei province. The minimum number of incremental cases was 13 and the maximum was 4823, which occurred on February 13, 2020. From January 1, 2020 to March 10, the average air pressure range is 1006.0-1031.2 hPa, the average is 1021.7hPa, (SD.5.1 hPa), and the fluctuation range is small.
The average wind speed ranges from 0 to 5.0 m/s and the fluctuation range is small too. The maximum rainfall is 38.9mm, which occurs in January 9, 2020 and has no obvious regularity.
The average temperature, the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature are 6.9°C, 11.6°C and 3.4°C respectively, the standard deviation of the maximum temperature is 5.0°C > that of the minimum temperature 4.3°C > that of the average temperature 4.0°C. The average WVP and the average RH are both related to the water loading in the air, and the mean ± standard deviations are 8.3 ± 2.4 (hPa) and 83.0 ± 8.2 (%), respectively. Ultraviolet intensity is not the routine monitoring items in the meteorological station. Therefore, the daily total solar radiation and the maximum solar irradiance are selected as two auxiliary parameters, and their mean values are 757.7± 587.3 (0.01 MJ/m 2 ) and 456.6±274.2 (W/m 2 ), the standard deviations are (0.01 MJ/m 2 ) and 274.2 (W/m 2 ), respectively. Obviously, the volatility of the values is very strong. Figure 1 shows the frequency statistics of incremental cases and meteorological parameters, among which the normality of average air pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature, average RH and average wind speed is better. The total solar radiation and the maximum solar irradiance present a saddle-shaped bimodal structure.
Figure 2 (a) shows the tendency of incremental cases changing with time. Obviously, it is a single-peak structure. Figure 2 (b-d) shows the tendency of average temperature, average WVP .

Figure 2 (b) as for average temperature-time pair, it can be seen that there is a fluctuating process after about January 10, 2020. Figure 2 (c) as for average WVP-time pair, after January 10, 2020, also has a fluctuating process, but the trend is relatively gentle. Figure 2 (d), there are two parallel tracks for the maximum solar irradiance-time pair, the general trend is rising but gentle.
Incremental cases in Hubei province is correlated with four meteorological parameters including average air pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average WVP (P<0.05). Among them, there is a positive correlation with the average air pressure with the correlation coefficient r = + 0.358. Negative correlation include average temperature, minimum temperature, average WVP with its coefficient r =-0.306,-0.347, -0.326, respectively (Table 2, Figure 3 ). From this, it can be judged that the increment of cases will be inhibited by the increase of temperature and water loading in the air. At the same time, the increase of average air pressure may increase the reproduction rate of the virus.
Through parameter selection in the way of entering in sequence, finally only the minimum temperature and incremental cases can establish a statistically significant linear regression model In other words, the result shows that the minimum temperature changes by 1 degree, and 72 incremental cases will change in the opposite direction. Let HB_DeltaN = 0, and get Δ min_temp = 18.6°C, therefore, minimum temperature rises 18.6°C on the basis of the mean value of 3.4°C, that is, if the average minimum temperature reaches 22°C, case increment statistically shrink to zero (Table 3 ). In addition, the residual analysis of the regression model shows that the residual conform to the normal distribution. The distribution of points in scatter plot, in which the X axis is ZRESID(regression starndardized residual), the Y axis is ZPRED(regression standardized predicted value), is uniform, indicating that the variances are homogeneous (Figure 4 ).

The outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei province from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020 has obvious correlation to meteorological factors. By using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, it discussed the correlation between daily incremental cases and meteorological factors in Hubei province. The results showed that the average temperature, the minimum temperature, WVP and air pressure were significantly correlated with the daily incremental cases. Incremental cases is positively correlated with atmospheric pressure and negatively correlated with average temperature, minimum temperature and WVP. Further, a linear regression model disclosed the linear relationship between the cases and the minimum temperature.
It found that the average temperature and the minimum temperature were negatively correlated with the COVID-19 incremental cases in Hubei province. The unary linear regression results showed that the minimum temperature increased by 1°C and the incremental cases decreased by 72 cases. This is consistent with studies of other respiratory viral infectious diseases. Studies have reported that SARS-CoV is sensitive to temperature and relatively stable at low temperatures. Higher relative humidity (RH)(>95%) and high temperature (e.g. 38°C) has synergistic effect on the inactivation of SARS-CoV activity, while lower temperature and lower humidity can prolong the survival time of virus on contaminated surface (Chan et al.,2011) . The number of daily SARS cases is negatively correlated with the highest and/or lowest temperature (Bi et al.,2007) , and the rate of SARS recurrence is also negatively correlated with the daily average temperature (Cai et al.,2007) . During the epidemic period, in the days with lower temperature, the risk of increasing the daily incidence of SARS is 18.18 times higher than that in the days with higher temperature (Lin et al.,2006) . Regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the average temperature (r =-0.45, P<0.001) recorded 13 to 17 days before SARS was confirmed and the number of clinically diagnosed cases (Yuan et al.,2006) .
In addition to SARS, meteorological factors affect seasonal influenza prevalence. Studies have found that low temperature may prolong the survival time of influenza virus (Cheng et al., 2016) and may lead to more influenza transmission (Yu et al., 2013) . For every 1°C drop, the risk of influenza infection in Finland increases by 11% (Jaakkola et al.,2014) . In addition, studies revealed that a 1°C drop in temperature in Hong Kong leads to an 8.55% rise in influenza cases .

Recently studies demonstrated that relationship between temperature and COVID-19 mortality. Every increase of 1°C in the diurnal temperature range caused COVID-19 mortality 2.92% increase (Ma et al.,2020) . Another study reported that the relationship between the average temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3°C, while it tended to be flat above 3°C. When the average temperature is lower than 3°C, the number of confirmed cases per day increases by 4.861% (95% CI:3.209% ~6.513%) (Xie & Zhu, 2020) . This result is contrary to our result. This study used daily confirmed cases and meteorological data (37 days in total) from multiple onset areas (122 cities) from January 23 to February 29, 2020. The difference is that two-month interval of observation included 53 days effective data, and we only use the data of Hubei province (including Wuhan, Xiaogan, Huanggang, and other a total of 17 cities or regions), covering a total of 67773 confirmed cases.
The explanation of the different results still needs to be discussed in depth. There is also a recent report on the relationship between COVID-19 and meteorological factors in 224 cities in China, among which the cumulative incidence rate and temperature have not found a significant correlation (Yao et al.,2020) . We believe that meteorological factors including temperature may be more relevant to the daily increasing case number rather than the cumulative number. In addition, the difference between the total number and the onset period in each city may also be a related factor affecting the results.
We found that the daily increasing case number of COVID-19 cases was associated with WVP rather than RH. The correlation between the daily increasing case number and RH is not statistically significant. Our study conducted curve fitting between average WVP and delta number (daily case increment) using S-curve. The S-curve model HB_DeltaN = EXP(4.235+15.919/ Ave_WVP) was obtained (95%CI, F = 6.927> F n-m-1 = 4.043,P<0.05). It could be seen from the regression equation that when the explanatory variable (average WVP) increased, the exponential part of the equation decreased, thus the response variable (case increment) decreased, this further illustrated that there is a negative correlation between the average WVP and the case increment, and goodness of fit R 2 = 0.124(P<0.05), which indicated that WVP can explain the change of 12.4% cases. Our results proved that compared with RH, WVP is more sensitive to COVID-19 occurring in epidemic areas of Hubei province. At the .

In the research on mortality model related to influenza, it was found that the change of WVP was the root cause of seasonal changes in influenza, while RH was not (Shaman et al.,2010) . Since then, the theoretical hypothesis of respiratory virus-induced diseases with WVP as the main regulatory factor has been established. After that, causal analysis of global influenza incidence data shows that temperature change and low AH are more likely to lead to changes in influenza activity than actual low temperature. According to their research, the conclusion is that WVP is a stronger driving factor than RH (Deyle et al.,2016 ).
China's epidemiological studies proved that influenza virus is negatively correlated with temperature and WVP (Sun et al., 2018) . In sub-frigid climate (Norway), WVP below 4 hPa on average may trigger influenza (Kolberg et al., 2019) . Studies in tropical/subtropical regions of China have found that, WVP was negatively correlated with the incidence ofH1N1pdm09 (Influenza A) and Yamagata (Influenza B) (Pan et al., 2019) . The study of Kormuth et al. (2018) showed that the infectivity to influenza virus in droplets and aerosols had no difference under different RH, that was to say, it had nothing to do with RH (Kormuth et al.,2018) . This undoubtedly brought new challenges to RH and respiratory virus survival and transmission. The relevant mechanism of WVP may be due to the degeneration of virus lipoprotein. Higher level of WVP will lead to surface inactivation of lipid-containing virus (Yang et al.,2012) , it is related to the phase transition of phospholipid bilayer membrane, which causes the peptide to cross-link at the air-water interface. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of WVP affecting virus survival (Peci et al.,2019) .

In previous studies of SARS, the number of SARS cases in Beijing was significantly negatively correlated with RH (r= -0.784,P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the RH recorded 13 to 17 days before SARS was confirmed and the number of clinically diagnosed cases (Yuan et al.,2006) . Others found that RH did not appear to play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV (Cai et al.,2007) . (Hervás et al., 2012) . In the United States, a study analyzing the relationship between meteorological factors and RSV activity in 9 cities under different climate types showed that in Delhi region, air pressure was the main relevant factor of RSV total amount, which was associated with 22% RSV activity (Yusuf et al.,2007) . In Beijing (Yuan et al.,2006) and Therefore, a balance must be maintained between virus concentration and its dispersion to achieve effective infectivity (Roy & Milton,2004) , but the detailed mechanism needs further .

We found for the first time the correlation between the minimum temperature, WVP and new cases of COVID-19. According to the analysis of its relevant mechanism, non-enveloped viruses (HRV and HEV) that cause respiratory tract infection may spread through close contact or droplet, rather than mainly through aerosol, therefore, the transmission and survival of the virus are relatively less dependent on meteorological factors (Sundell et al.,2016) . However, enveloped virus (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV) has greater dependence on meteorological factors. At the same time, previous studies have shown that envelope protein (E) of coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome is directly related to virus virulence (Schoeman & Fielding.2019) . We believe that envelope proteins that may be closely related to 2019-nCov pathogenicity are sensitive to minimum temperature and WVP, and they are more vulnerable to climatic factors, especially temperature (including average temperature and minimum temperature) and WVP. This inference is of theoretical significance for understanding meteorological factors and viral respiratory infectious diseases. Of course, more evidence is needed to support it in the future.
During the COVID-19 epidemic, human-to-human transmission was still in a phase dominated by community and hospital infections. At this time, meteorological factors, especially low temperature and low WVP had related effects on the in vitro viability, the quantity per unit area and transmission distance of 2019-nCov. We believe that meteorological factors influence on virus viability and the contribution capacity of changing the transmission is 9%(minimum temperature) and 12.4%(WVP), respectively. These do not belong to manual measure to control transmission such as virus elimination, washing hands, wearing masks, and keeping social distance. Meteorological factors play a role in the spread of the virus from patients (including asymptomatic infected people) to unprotected people (including susceptible and non-susceptible people). It will involve biochemistry, photochemistry and aerodynamics.
Considering the statistical period of 3 months, the actual effective data is only 53. In the case of limited data, there are 4 parameters with obvious correlation, which is completely reasonable to believe that, first, with the increase of effective observations, the correlation between parameters will gradually appear; secondly, case increment is very sensitive to .

Since different meteorological factors have different mechanisms for virus survival and transmission, each index has its own characteristics, so it is necessary to establish different regression equation fitting analysis of their characteristics, and to further study the multi-parameter coupling mechanism.
This study has some limitations. First, we did not distinguish the gender, age, health status and other information of the patients in the case, nor did we consider the host factors that play a role in the spread of the disease, such as immunity, this may result in bias of the derived results.
In addition, we cannot rule out the possible influence of some mixed factors such as human movement and air pollution. Second, previous studies have shown that viruses that cause respiratory infectious diseases are sensitive to climate. Climate factors may affect the survival and transmission of viruses in the environment, host susceptibility and exposure possibilities. We found that meteorological factors played an important role during the COVID-19 in Hubei province, but we are also very clear that, as scholars have known, meteorological parameters can only explain no more than 30% of influenza activity changes (Monamele et al.,2017) , and there are still many problems to be confirmed about 2019-nCoV. Third, the impact of social distancing measures on the epidemic situation should be considered in the study. This measure is an important part of the public health response to COVID-19. The corresponding measures taken in Hubei province and Wuhan City have seen actual results.
First of all, in January of each year, the overall temperature and humidity in Hubei province are at the lowest level throughout the year, and it is in this month that COVID-19 erupted on a large scale. The time range is from January 1, 2020 to March 10, with 67773 confirmed cases cumulatively. Meteorological factors (parameters) provide evidence related to the incidence of COVID-19. Correlation analysis showed that average atmospheric pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average WVP were significantly correlated with daily increase in COVID-19 cases. Obviously, different climate factor indicators may affect the occurrence of COVID-19 epidemic. Although this conclusion comes from the evolution of confirmed cases in COVID-19 in Hubei province of China, they still show that, various results .
