Background: Estimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of 19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, 25 data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and 26 meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-27 regression. 28 Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were 29 searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies 30 examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients 31 were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors 32 were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for 33 publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk 34 factors. 35 Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of 36
severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 37 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these 38 estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently 39 predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at 40 presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity. 41 Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality 42 should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk.

Introduction pressure of oxygen < 300 mmHg, requiring hospitalization. Critical illness was defined as having 114 respiratory failure, circulatory shock, end-organ failure or any combination of the above 115 requiring intensive care. In addition, the following variables were extracted as potential 116 covariates of the above outcomes. Central tendency (i.e. mean or median) and dispersion (i.e. 117 SD, SE, 95%CI, IQR or range) of age were extracted. When not reported, study level means and 118 standard deviations for age were imputed from the available statistics (i.e. median, IQR or 119 range). 12 Proportions of the following variables within a study sample were extracted: age < 18 120 years, age > 60 years, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, chronic liver 121 disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, 122 immunosuppression (e.g. HIV), smoking and pregnancy. Proportions of patients with specific 123 presenting symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea), 124 asymptomatic cases, specific laboratory parameters (i.e. positive nucleic acid test for COVID-19, 125 leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase 126 (LDH), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high 127 procalcitonin and high D-dimer based on reference ranges considered in each study) and 128 radiographic features (i.e. no lesions on CT, patchy consolidation, ground glass opacities, 129 peripheral distribution, and bilateral lung involvement or involvement of > 3 lobes). 130 is also known to ensure analytic consistency and minimize bias. 14 Consistency of the findings of 137 the meta-analyses were confirmed by leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. 15 Given that under- 138 reporting and publication bias could result in biased (i.e. smaller) prevalence estimates, 139 publication bias was examined using funnel plots and the effect-sizes were imputed for estimated 140 missing (i.e. unpublished / unreported) studies via the trim-and-fill method. 16, 17 The meta-141 analyses were repeated including the effect-size estimates of these potentially missing studies in 142 order to obtain unbiased estimates of the three primary outcomes. Heterogeneity of effect-sizes 143 was quantified by calculating the Higgins' I 2 statistic for each meta-analysis. 18, 19 To explain the 144 heterogeneity of the studies 20 , exploratory univariate random-effects meta-regression analyses 145 were performed to examine the moderator effects of each of the covariates described above.
Results of database search, subsequent screening and eligibility assessment are Table S2 with their references. The summary 154 statistics of all covariates are summarized in Table S3 in Appendix. 155 Pooled prevalence of severe or critically severe illness among individuals with COVID-156 19 infection was estimated to be 14.6% (95%CI, 8.9%-23.1%) in the random-effects meta-funnel plot of the effect-sizes was severely asymmetric, suggesting substantial underreporting or 160 publication bias (Figure 2b ). Seven effect-sizes were imputed to correct for the publication bias. 161 When the random-effects meta-analysis was performed including these imputed effect-sizes (i.e. 162 after correcting for publication bias), the prevalence of severe or critical illness increased to 163 25.8% (95%CI, 17.2%-36.8%) (Figure 2c ). 164 Significant heterogeneity was observed among the prevalence estimates of severe illness 165 (τ 2 = 1.679; I 2 = 94%, p < 0.001). Correcting for publication bias decreased this heterogeneity (I 2 166 = 85%, 95%CI, 80%-89%), however, heterogeneity remained significant (p < 0.001). 167 Exploratory univariate random-effects meta-regression analyses conducted with the aim of 168 explaining the heterogeneity using the moderator effects of the considered covariates suggested 169 that each of increasing mean age (p = 0.006) and prevalence of age > 60 years (p < 0.001), 170 hypertension (p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.038), malignancy (p = 0.023) and 171 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.025) were associated with a greater risk of severe 172 or critical illness associated with COVID-19, while the prevalence of age < 18 years (p = 0.007) 173 within a sample was associated with a reduced risk of severe or critical illness. Prevalence of the 174 presenting clinical features of fever (p < 0.001), dyspnea (p = 0.028) and diarrhea (p = 0.026); 175 laboratory findings of lymphocytopenia (p = 0.003), elevated LDH (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001) 176 and D-dimer levels (p < 0.001); and bilateral lung involvement or involvement of > 3 lung lobes 177 (p = 0.006) was associated with increased risk of severe or critically severe illness, while having 178 no radiological features on chest CT was associated with decreased risk of severe illness (p = Table S4 in Appendix. 182 All rights reserved.

The random effects meta-regression analyses revealed a pooled estimate of 4.8% 188 (95%CI, 2.4%-9.5%) for the prevalence of critical illness in COVID-19 infection (Figure 3a) . 189 Leave-one-out meta-regression analyses did not significantly change this estimate. The funnel 190 plot of effect-sizes (Figure 3b ) was highly suggestive of underreporting or publication bias.
Eleven effect-sizes had to be imputed to statistically correct for this bias and after correction, the 192 pooled prevalence of critical illness in COVID-19 infection increased to 16.3% (95%CI, 9.8%-193 25.7%) (Figure 3c ).
Significant heterogeneity of effect-sizes was a concern for the meta-analysis of 195 prevalence of critical illness as well (τ 2 = 1.994; I 2 = 92%, p < 0.001). Correcting for publication 196 bias decreased this heterogeneity (I 2 = 78%, 95%CI, 69%-84%), however, heterogeneity 197 remained significant (p < 0.001). Univariate meta-regression analyses suggested increased risk of 198 critical illness associated with sample characteristics of increasing mean age (p = 0.002), 199 prevalence of age > 60 years (p < 0.001), comorbid hypertension (p < 0.01), cardiac disease (p = 200 0.023) and malignancy (p = 0.041). Similarly, prevalence of fever (p = 0.044), dyspnea (p = 201 0.042) and fatigue (p = 0.036) on presentation; prevalence of increased LDH (p = 0.003), CRP (p 202 = 0.008) and D-dimer (p = 0.021) were associated with a greater risk of critical illness (Table S5   203 in Appendix). author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, as with severe and critically severe illness, publication 216 bias / potential underreporting was apparent on the funnel plot of effect sizes (Figure 4b ).
Thirteen effect-sizes were imputed to account for missing / unreported effects in an attempt to 218 statistically correct for the publication bias and conducting the meta-regression analyses with the 219 addition of these effect-sizes revealed a pooled estimate of 7.4% (95%CI, 4.5%-11.9%) for the 220 mortality rate associated with COVID-19 infection ( Figure 4c ).
Heterogeneity of effect-sizes on prevalence of mortality in COVID-19 was also a concern 222 (τ 2 = 2.996; I 2 = 86%, p < 0.001). Correction for publication bias decreased the heterogeneity (I 2 223 = 61%, 95%CI, 45%-73%), yet the heterogeneity remained significant (p < 0.001). Univariate 224 meta-regression analyses modeling heterogeneity indicated increased mortality risks associated 225 with increasing mean age (p < 0.001), prevalence of age > 60 years (p = 0.011), presenting with 226 fatigue (p = 0.048), leukocytosis (p =0.007), high LDH (p = 0.030) and low albumin (p < 0.001).
Prevalence of age < 18 years (p = 0.036) was associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19-228 associated mortality (Table S6 in Appendix). author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Second, high degree of heterogeneity was a concern. However, this should be 284 expected in any meta-analysis due to the variability in methodology and study samples and we 285 used heterogeneity to explore covariates in meta-regression analyses. 18, 20 Third, funnel plots of 286 all three meta-analyses indicating substantial publication bias, limiting the generalizability of 287 uncorrected random-effects meta-analyses. Finally, the protocol was not pre-registered. Use of a 288 systematic search strategy; use of random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses 289 assuming high heterogeneity of effect-sizes; exploring the etiology of heterogeneity in meta-290 regression analyses, which also identified risk factors of morbidity and mortality; exploring the 291 validity of our findings in sensitivity analyses; and statistically correcting for publication / 292 underreporting bias are notable strengths of our systematic review and meta-analysis.
In conclusion, after correcting for publication bias, COVID-19 associated overall rates of 294 requirement for hospitalization, intensive care and case fatality could be as high as 26%, 16% 295 and 7.4% respectively. This underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive 296 measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at 297 presentation; and elevated CRP seem to predict increased disease severity, while increasing age 298 and elevated LDH seem to consistently predict severity and case fatality. These risk factors 299 should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
