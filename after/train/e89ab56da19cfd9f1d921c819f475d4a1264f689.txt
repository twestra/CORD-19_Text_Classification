In addition, R TTCC is significant higher in CQ treatment group compared to 67 HCQ group, which indicates that relative safety of HCQ. Both CQ and HCQ 68 have certain cytotoxicity in time dependent manner which indicates the 69 necessity of short period administration clinically. HCQ has the less impact in 7 70 cell lines proliferation and less toxicity compared to CQ in heart, liver, kidney (3-6). Apart from primarily inflammation in the lungs, it is also suggested that other 93 vital organs like kidneys, heart, gut, as well as liver, were also suffered severe damage 94 according to the autopsies, suggesting that individuals or older with chronic 95 underlying diseases appear to have a higher risk for developing severe outcomes. calculated at the given target organ, respectively. The data suggest that HCQ was 127 demonstrated to be much less toxic than CQ, at least at certain key tissues (heart, liver, 128 kidney, and lung). Taken together, this study provides the information regarding 129 cytotoxicity in a wide spectrum and will be beneficial for both pharmacologists and 
The effect of CQ on cell proliferation 134 To gain the more comprehensive cytotoxic information upon CQ and HCQ treatment, Table 1 ) (9). Therefore, we can preliminarily conclude that the selectivity 188 index (SI) of HCQ is higher than that of CQ in most cell types. The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 27, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056762 doi: bioRxiv preprint of tissue toxicity for the safety profile of these two drugs in the given tissues. As 202 shown in Figure 3 , we systematically compared the toxicity between CQ and HCQ, 203 the R TTCC value of CQ is 6-87 times more than that of HCQ in lung, heart, kidney and 204 liver, which suggests that the toxicity risk of HCQ in the above tissues is much lower 205 than that of CQ. were obtained as previously reported. The lung to blood concentration ratio for CQ 233 and HCQ (obtained from animal studies) was used to predict the drug concentration in 234 the lungs, heart, liver, and kidney. To better investigate the potential toxicity in vivo 235 and in vitro, we proposed R TTCC (ratio of tissue concentration and CC 50 ) derived from 236 PBPK model to predict the risk of toxic profiles in different tissues. We compared the 237 R TTCC data collected from heart, liver, kidney, lung, and revealed HCQ has shown 238 significantly safe profiles than that of upon CQ treatment (9). However, recent 239 publication reported that CQ was safer than HCQ according to SI (7, 9). We speculate 240 that the safety difference might be due to their complex pharmacokinetic 241 characteristics in vivo, which possessed specific distribution and long half-life of 242 around days. In short, based on our just published study, we further developed the 243 novel parameters to predict the potential toxicity besides the traditional selectivity 244 index (SI), (the ratio of the CC 50 to EC 50 ), which is a commonly accepted to measure 245 the window between cytotoxicity and antiviral capacity (9). As a result, our data 246 shows that kidney, lung and heart are prone to the toxicity of CQ, otherwise lung and 247 kidney are relative vulnerable upon HCQ treatment ( Figure 5 ). In the meantime, In this study, we perform dynamic imaging system to accurately and precisely 255 monitor the whole proliferation process other than conventional CCK8 assay.
