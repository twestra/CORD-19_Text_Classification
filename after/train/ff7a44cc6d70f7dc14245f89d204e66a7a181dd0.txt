Nasopharyngeal sampling protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis guidelines only recommend synthetic fiber swabs. We show that simple and cheap cotton tipped plastic swabs do not inhibit PCR and have equivalent performance to rayon swabs. Cotton tipped plastic swabs are massively produced worldwide and would prevent swabs supplies shortage during current high SARS-CoV-2 testing demands, particularly on developing countries.
During the surveillance period from April 7th to 14th 2020, forty-four (44) patients were randomly included in this study. A total of thirty-three (33; 75%) patients showed laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 and eleven (11; 25%) were negative, either with plastic rayon tipped or plastic cotton tipped swabs (Table 1) . By reference to the gold standard plastic rayon tipped swab NP sampling, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by plastic cotton tipped swab NP sampling provided a 100% sensitivity and specificity indicating a total agreement among swabs.
Ct (mean±SD) values for N1, N2 and RdRP genes for plastic rayon tipped swabs (N1: 33.71±3.93; N2: 36.84±3.17; RdRP: 33.75±3.05) and plastic cotton tipped swabs (N1: 32.55±5.14; N2: 34.37±5.25; RdRP: 27.66±2.95) were statistically not different for viral specific genes N1 and N2 (p = 0.30 and 0.052, respectively), but statistically significant (p<0.001) for the RNA extraction quality control housekeeping gene RdRP, indicating a better RNA yield for plastic cotton tipped swabs ( Table 2 ).
We herein report that the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using plastic cotton tipped swabs NP sampling is as reliable as using plastic synthetic fiber tipped like rayon swabs, considered as the gold standard by CDC (3) . The use of cotton tipped swabs for respiratory specimens collection is included at WHO guidelines (2) and it has been reported specifically reliable for respiratory retroviruses like influenza (4) . We also excluded any inhibitory effect over PCR reaction associated to plastic cotton tipped swabs. However, our data do not endorse to use any kind of cotton tipped swabs as wooden made ones as some chemicals derived from the wood could interfere with PCR reaction. Plastic cotton tipped swabs are cheap and made worldwide even in developing countries like Ecuador; and based on our results do not compromise neither sensitivity nor specificity for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Its endorsement on international guidelines upon more independent validation studies would help to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis disruption due to swab supply shortage as recently happened in Ecuador.
To our knowledge, this is the the second study comparing swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing (5), but the first of its kind providing a cheap and worldwide available alternative like the plastic cotton tipped swab. Additionally, high sensitivity was recently reported for nasal versus NP sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (6); taking together this finding and ours, even sterile short plastic cotton tipped swabs like the one use for ear hygiene could represent an option under lack of NP swabs supply. We call upon the worldwide microbiology community, particularly at developing countries, to consider those findings to enhance the testing capacity to fight the spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
