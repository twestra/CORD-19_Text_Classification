Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality 22 worldwide despite the recent advent of highly effective direct-acting antivirals. The envelope 23 glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans 24 (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with 25 cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this 26 potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody 27 Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFc's 28 capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC 50 29 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed 30 for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration 31 of AvFc was well tolerated; after 11 consecutive doses every other day at 25 mg/kg, there were 32 no significant changes in body or liver weights, nor any impact noted in blood human albumin 33 levels or serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology further 34 confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented 35 genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity 36 failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising 37 therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and 38 efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-39
INTRODUCTION 41 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped monopartite positive sense ssRNA virus in the injection in C57bl/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, BarHarbor, ME, USA; 8-week-old males 134 and females; n=4 per time point) and sampling blood at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post 135 injection. The concentration of AvFc was then measured using an HIV gp120-coated ELISA. 136 Briefly, a recombinant gp120 (HIV CM235, NIH AIDS Reagent Program) was coated overnight 137 at 0.3 μg/mL followed by blocking with 5% dry milk-PBST. Serum samples at varying dilutions 138 were incubated for 2 h followed by detection by a goat anti-human Fc-HRP secondary antibody 139 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The plasma concentration of AvFc was calculated by interpolating 140 from a standard curve. PK parameters were calculated using the PKSolver Microsoft Excel Add-141 on (35). AvFc lec-(25 mg/kg, n=5) for 11 doses, or AvFc (25 mg/kg, n=5 each) for 8 or 11 doses. 150 Treatments were co-administered i.p. with virus inoculation (5 x 10 5 copies/kg) on day 0 with a 151 genotype 1a strain (PBC002) and every other day thereafter. The general conditions and body 152 weights of the animals were monitored every other day, while serum HCV RNA and blood h-Alb 153 were measured every 7 days by RT-PCR and latex agglutination immunonephelometry (LZ Test 154 "Eiken" U-ALB, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.) respectively.

At the study 157 termination on day 35, animals were euthanized and subject to gross necropsy and general 158 health. Blood was also drawn via cardiac puncture and used for ALT, HCV RNA and h-Alb 159 analyses.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 24, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 /2020 AvFc exhibits broad anti-HCV activity in vitro 180 Building on our previous observation that AvFc has affinity to a recombinant HCV E2 181 envelope protein (24), we first examined whether AvFc inhibits HCV infection in vitro using 182 multiple genotypes of cell culture-produced virus (HCVcc) or pseudotyped virus (HCVpp).
AvFc significantly blocked the infection of the human liver cell line Huh-7 by HCVcc from 184 genotypes 1a, 2a, 4a, 5a, and 6a, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values in the low 185 nanomolar range (Table 1 and Figure 1A ). Compared to Avaren monomer, AvFc overall 186 showed approximately 2-log higher activity, while no inhibitory effect was observed for a plant-187 produced anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 that shares the same human IgG1 Fc 188 region with AvFc (36). Additionally, Avaren and AvFc, but not VRC01, effectively neutralized 189 HCVpp harboring a murine leukemia virus backbone, suggesting that the lectin and the lectibody 190 act as an entry inhibitor ( Figure 1B) .
Previously, we found that AvFc has limited solubility in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 194 at concentrations above 1 mg/mL (unpublished observation). In order to facilitate in vivo studies 195 we screened for an optimal liquid formulation for systemic administration that can impart 196 improved stability and solubility to AvFc at higher concentrations. Initial buffer screening 197 revealed that AvFc is prone to degradation at and below pH 6.5, suggesting that AvFc is not 198 stable in acidic pH conditions ( Figure S1 ). Further pre-formulation studies led us to identify an 199 optimal buffer composed of 30 mM histidine, pH 7.0, 100 mM sucrose and 100 mM NaCl.

Consequently, these results suggested that administration of the drug every other day 216 (Q2D) might be sufficient to keep the virus under control in a murine HCV challenge model. 217 We then assessed the safety of Q2D administration of AvFc in PXB-mice®. To 218 effectively discern potential toxicity associated with AvFc's HMG-binding activity, we included 219 an AvFc variant lacking HMG-binding activity as a control (AvFc lec-; Figure S2 ). PXB mice 220 received either the vehicle (the histidine buffer described above) Q2D for 11 total doses, AvFc at 221 25 mg/kg Q2D for a total of 8 or 11 doses, or AvFc lecat 25 mg/kg Q2D for 11 total doses. As 222 shown in Figure 4A -C, no significant differences in either body weights, blood h-Alb levels or weight were seen ( Figure 4D ). These results indicate that AvFc, formulated in the histidine 225 buffer, is well tolerated in the immunocompromised mice engrafted with human hepatocytes.
Histopathology was performed to evaluate any potential toxicity to the human liver grafts 227 due to AvFc administration (Table 2 and Figure 5 ). In the human hepatocyte area, slight to 228 moderate (score 2 to 3 in Table 2 Figure 5F ). 235 Collectively, it was concluded that there was no treatment-related adverse effect in the liver 236 tissue. The full pathology report may be found in the Supplementary Information. 239 Lastly, we assessed AvFc's protective efficacy against HCV infection in vivo using the 240 treatment regimen described above. PXB mice were inoculated i.p. with a genotype 1a virus 241 along with initial treatment with 25 mg/kg of AvFc or AvFc lecon day 0. As shown in Figure   242 6A, AvFc lec--treated mice showed high serum HCV RNA levels from day 7 post challenge 243 through the end of the study on day 35. In sharp contrast, animals treated with both 8 and 11 244 doses of AvFc did not show any detectable level of HCV RNA in sera, indicating that the 245 lectibody prevented the infection of human liver grafts by the virus.

The mechanism of HCV neutralization by AvFc is likely through binding to HMGs on 258 the E1/E2 envelope protein dimer, which blocks their interaction with host cell receptors and 259 viral entry. Unlike HIV envelope glycoproteins, whose glycan content can vary widely between 260 strains, the number and position of glycosylation sites on E1/E2 are highly conserved, indicating 261 their critical role in HCV's infectious processes (37).

Accordingly, the remarkable efficacy seen in the present in vivo HCV challenge study 273 may be partially Fc-mediated. Further investigations are necessary to address this possibility.
The present study also demonstrated that AvFc therapy is well tolerated in mice and 275 human hepatocytes, as Q2D i.p. administration of 25 mg/kg of AvFc up to 11 doses did not show 276 any obvious toxicity in PXB mice by gross necropsy or histopathology of engrafted human 277 hepatocytes, nor did it result in significant changes in body weight, h-Alb, or ALT levels ( Figure   278 3, 4). We hypothesize that the lack of any significant toxicity is attributable to AvFc's unique indication for liver transplantation in the US, a large number of procedures will continue to be 293 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
