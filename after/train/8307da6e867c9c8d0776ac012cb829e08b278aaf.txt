Hypertension is a highly prevalent, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and 3 mortality 1 . Epidemiologic analyses have correlated hypertension with pneumonia risk in small 4 studies 2 3 . Whether this represents a direct consequence of hypertension or influence of co-5 morbid risk factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, air pollution, or smoking is unclear.
Hypertension has emerged as one of the most well-recognized risk factors for developing novel 8 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] [5] [6] [7] . In particular, patients with 9 COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are particularly enriched 10 for hypertension 7 . Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is an endogenous regulator of blood 11 pressure that is highly expressed in the lung and has been linked to risk for acute respiratory 12 distress syndrome (ARDS) 8 9 . ACE2, a homolog and endogenous counter-regulator of ACE, is 13 expressed in a subset of type II alveolar cells and is an important facilitator of cell entry by 14 SARS-CoV-2 [8] [9] [10] . ACE2 has also been implicated in lung injury related to other respiratory 15 viruses and bacterial pathogens [11] [12] [13] . While professional societies have encouraged patients to 16 remain on ACE inhibitors during the present pandemic, recommendations were largely made in 17 the absence of robust human data.
Although epidemiologic analyses support a plausible causal relationship between blood 20 pressure regulation and respiratory infection risk, confounding from comorbid conditions limit 21 such inference. Importantly, comorbid factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, and 22 cardiovascular disease have also been described as independent risk factors for pneumonia 23 previously as well as for COVID-19. Mendelian randomisation is a statistical approach using 24 genetic proxies for an exposure as opposed to the exposure itself to mitigate risks for 25 confounding facilitating more robust causal inference 14 .

In the UK Biobank prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we (1) estimate the epidemiologic 4 association of hypertension with incident pneumonia risk and indices of pulmonary function, and
(2) apply Mendelian randomisation to test the hypothesis that blood pressure independently 6 causally influences risks for pneumonia and reduced pulmonary function.

Association analysis of the SBP and DBP PRS with incident respiratory diseases was 1 performed using Cox proportional hazards models in R (version 3.5, R Foundation, Vienna, 2 Austria), adjusting for age, age 2 , sex, smoking status, and the first ten principal components of 3 ancestry. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by Schoenfeld residuals and was 4 satisfied. Association analyses between the SBP and DBP PRS and pulmonary function tests 5 was performed using a generalized linear model adjusted for the same covariates.
Association of the 75 variants for each PRS with both prevalent and incident pneumonia was 8 performed using a logistic regression Wald test in Hail-0.2, adjusting for age, age 2 , sex, smoking 9 status, the first ten principal components of ancestry, and genotype array. Using these 10 associations, two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed using the ICBP-derived SBP CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Genetic association of blood pressure with incident respiratory disease 10 11 We first used one-sample Mendelian randomisation to determine whether a genetic 12 predisposition to increased blood pressure is associated with increased risk for incident 13 pneumonia as well as other respiratory diseases.

In a large, prospective, population-based cohort, we show that prevalent hypertension is a risk 24 factor for incident pneumonia, lower respiratory infections, ARDS or respiratory failure, as well 25 as many other respiratory diseases. Additionally, our epidemiological analyses also 26 .

Our Mendelian randomisation studies imply that 2 the relationship between increased blood pressure with increased risk for pneumonia as well as 3 reduced pulmonary function may be causal. ACEi may be protective for pneumonia risk 42 . As detailed earlier, since ACE2 may serve as a 25 receptor for respiratory viral entry and is an endogenous counter-regulator of ACE, conflicting 26 .

Thus, withdrawal of ACEi and challenges of blood pressure management while promoting 12 physical distancing, may not only have untoward cardiovascular consequences but may 13 inadvertently increase pneumonia risk.
Strengths and limitations 16 17 This study has several strengths, including the analysis of a large, genotyped population-based 18 cohort with high fidelity phenotyping, including with subclinical respiratory phenotypes.
Furthermore, diverse phenotyping facilitates extensive individual-level covariate adjustment in 20 the models and sensitivity analyses to assess for pleiotropy.

We have performed a number of sensitivity analyses to assess for 2 possible confounders, in particular, we observe that our genetic instruments for blood pressure 3 are not associated with key socioeconomic and lifestyle factors influencing both blood pressure 4 and pneumonia risk. We further maintain a sparsely adjusted model in our one-sample 5 Mendelian randomization analyses to reduce the potential for collider bias 52 
Our study provides evidence that hypertension directly influences the risk of pneumonia.
Vigilance for blood pressure monitoring and management may reduce risk for pneumonia,
including potentially for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
