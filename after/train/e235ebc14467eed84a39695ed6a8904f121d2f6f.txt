The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally with high disparity in the 2 susceptibility of the disease severity. Identification of the key underlying factors for 3 this disparity is highly warranted. Here we describe constructing a proteomic risk 4 score based on 20 blood proteomic biomarkers which predict the progression to 5 severe COVID-19. We demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without 6 infection, this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory 7 cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further discovered 8 that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the above proteomic 9 biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning model, and that these gut 10 microbiota features are highly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in another 11 set of 366 individuals. Fecal metabolomic analysis suggested potential amino 12 acid-related pathways linking gut microbiota to inflammation. This study suggests 13 that gut microbiota may underlie the predisposition of normal individuals to severe
With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) defined as 'global pandemic ' and 18 spreading worldwide at an unprecedented speed, more than two million individuals 19 have been infected globally since its first detection in December 2019 to mid-April CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We only used 20 of the 22 proteins for our PRS construction 73 because 2 proteins were unavailable in our large proteomics database among 74 non-infected participants for the further analysis. Among the COVID-19 patients, 75 Poisson regression analysis indicated that per 10% increment in the PRS there was 76 .

To explore the potential implication of the PRS among non-COVID-19 individuals, 81 we constructed the PRS using the same set of 20 blood proteins among a cohort of 82 non-infected participants with data of both proteomics and inflammatory markers 83 (n=990). The blood proteomic data was based on the baseline serum samples of the 84 cohort ( Figure S1 ). We investigated the correlation between the PRS and blood To investigate the potential role of gut microbiota in the susceptibility of healthy 103 individuals to COVID-19, we next explored the relationship between the gut 104 microbiota and the above COVID-19-related PRS in a sub-cohort of 301 participants 105 with measurement of both gut microbiota (16s rRNA) and blood proteomics data 106 .

Pearson's r of 0.18 between the core OTUs-predicted PRS versus actual PRS (p<0.05), 137 also outperforming the predictive capacity of the above demographic characteristics 138 and laboratory tests (Pearson's r =0.08, p=0.31) ( Figure 3A ). These findings support 139 that change in the gut microbiota may precede the change in the blood proteomic 140 biomarkers, inferring a potential causal relationship. Fecal metabolome may be the key to link the PRS-related core microbial features 153 and host inflammation 154 We hypothesized that the influences of the core microbial features on the PRS and 155 host inflammation were driven by some specific microbial metabolites. So we 156 assessed the relationship between the core gut microbiota and fecal metabolome 157 among 987 participants, whose fecal metabolomics and 16s rRNA microbiome data 158 were collected and measured at the same time point during the follow-up visit of the 159 participants ( Figure S1 ).

The ultimate goal of QA/QC is to provide the reliable data for biomarker discovery 593 study and/ or to aid molecular biology research. To achieve this, three types of quality are commonly processed using the same procedures as the samples to be analyzed.
The reagent blanks serve as a useful alert to systematic contamination. As the reagent 618 blanks consist of high purity solvents and are analyzed using the same methods as the 619 study samples, they are also used to wash the column and remove cumulative matrix 620 effects throughout the study.

Haptoglobin captures, and combines with free plasma hemoglobin to allow hepatic recycling of heme iron and to prevent kidney damage. Haptoglobin also acts as an Antimicrobial; Antioxidant, has antibacterial activity and plays a role in modulating many aspects of the acute phase response.
