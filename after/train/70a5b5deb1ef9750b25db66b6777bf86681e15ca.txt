Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for both severe acute 59 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2). SARS-CoV caused a 60 pneumonia outbreak in 2002-2003 with a mortality rate of 9.6% and over 800 deaths worldwide 61
(3). SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first 62 recognized in December 2019 and has now reached pandemic proportions (2, 4). SARS-CoV-2 63 infection can be fatal, with the risk for increased disease severity correlating with advanced age 64 and underlying comorbidities, while children and younger individuals have milder disease (5, 6). 65
These trends could reflect age-related differences in ACE2 distribution and expression in the 66 respiratory tract. Previous studies have variably shown ACE2 protein in the upper and lower 67 respiratory tract, but cellular localization and distribution in human lung tissues have been 68 inconsistent and contradictory (7-10) (Supplemental Table 1 ). In vitro studies demonstrate that 69 ACE2 is expressed at the apical membrane of polarized airway epithelia, where it permits viral 70 interaction and cell entry (10, 11). Here, we investigated the hypothesis that ACE2 expression 71 drives disease severity in susceptible patient populations through enhanced abundance or 72 distribution of ACE2 in different locations or cell types of the respiratory tract. 73 74 Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pneumonia and acute lung injury, so we first 75 assessed publicly available scRNA-seq data from distal lung biopsies (12) and evaluated ACE2 76 transcript abundance in specific cell types. In the alveoli, most ACE2 transcripts were in alveolar 77 type II (AT2) cells (89.5% of ACE2 + cells) (Figure 1a) , but specifically within a subset of these 78 cells (1.2% of AT2 cells) (Figure 1b, Supplemental Figure 1a -b). Next, we optimized and 79 validated ACE2 immunohistochemistry in extrapulmonary control tissues with high ACE2 80 expression (Supplemental Figure 2) . We evaluated human lung tissues by immunohistochemistry 81 (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3 ). Alveoli exhibited apical ACE2 protein in a 82 small number (usually ~1% or less) of AT2 cells (Figure 1c) , consistent with the results from 83 scRNA-seq. The identity of these cells was confirmed by co-staining for surfactant protein-C. 84
This ACE2 + subset of AT2 cells was often observed within areas of alveolar collapse (Figures 85 1d-f), and these ACE2 + cells were more plump and larger than ACE2 -AT2 cells in the same 86 tissue section (Figure 1g ). AT2 cells can hypertrophy and proliferate following alveolar injury as 87 they repopulate damaged alveolar type I (AT1) cells along the alveolar wall (13). Interestingly, 88 alveolar macrophages were negative for ACE2 protein staining by immunohistochemistry, 89 despite previous reports of ACE2 protein in these cells (Supplemental Table 1 ). The lack of 90 ACE2 expression in macrophages was also confirmed by scRNA-seq data that revealed ACE2 91 mRNA transcripts in only 0.1% of macrophages, monocytes, or dendritic cells (Supplemental 92 Figure 1a -b). The concordance between scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry results provides 93 evidence that ACE2 in the alveoli is primarily expressed in a subset of AT2 cells and that 94 alveolar macrophages do not express ACE2. 95 96 Recent evidence indicates that proteases such as TMPRSS2 facilitate entry of SARS-97
CoV-2 into ACE2 + cells (14). We evaluated scRNA-seq data and observed that TMPRSS2 was 98 expressed in 35.5% of all AT2 cells (Figure 2a) , and in 50.0% of ACE2 + AT2 cells (Figure 2b) . 99
Additionally, we observed colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the apical membrane of 100 AT2 cells (Figure 2c ). These findings suggest that AT2 cells with apical ACE2 and TMPRSS2 101 could readily facilitate SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and disease as seen in COVID-19  102   patients.  103  4   104 We next evaluated ACE2 in the conducting airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles). In 105 the trachea and bronchi, apical ACE2 was rare and limited to ciliated cells (Figure 1h ), similar to 106 previous results in primary human airway epithelial cultures (11). In the submucosal glands of 107 large airways, occasional serous cells and vessels near the acini were positive for ACE2 108 (Supplemental Figures 3a-b) . In bronchioles, ACE2 was regionally localized (Figures 1i-k) . 109
These findings show nominal detection of ACE2, corresponding with the lack of primary airway 110 disease (e.g. bronchitis, etc.) seen in COVID-19 patients. 111 112 Detection of ACE2 protein has had contrasting variability reported between several small 113 studies (8, 10). In this larger study, we saw regional distribution of ACE2 protein varied between 114 donors. We detected ACE2 protein in surface epithelium of large airways in only 12% of 115 tracheal and 27% of bronchial tissues (Figure 3a ). In the distal areas of the lung, ACE2 was more 116 common, with positive protein detection in 36% of bronchiolar and 59% of alveolar samples 117 ( Figure 3a) . A similar pattern of variable alveolar ACE2 was seen for mRNA transcripts in the 118 scRNA-seq data, where 50% of donors showed low expression in AT2 cells, and the other 50% 119 of donors showed high expression in the same cell type (Figure 3b ). These findings suggest that 120 ACE2 expression can vary between different lung regions and between individuals. Despite the 121 heterogeneity of ACE2 detection between donors, 79% of subjects had positive ACE2 protein 122 staining in at least one tissue. Given the large variability observed, it is possible that sampling 123 limitations were responsible for the lack of ACE2 detection in the remaining 21% of donors. 124
Additionally, we acknowledge that ACE2 could be expressed at levels below the limits of 125 detection for scRNA-seq or immunohistochemistry. 126 .

The ACE2 gene resides on the X chromosome and therefore 129 could be differentially regulated between males and females due to variable X-inactivation (15). 130
Male sex correlates with increased levels of circulating ACE2 (reviewed in (16)) and early 131 reports suggest males have increased COVID-19 severity (17). Advanced age and chronic 132 comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease are also associated with 133 increased circulating ACE2 (reviewed in (16)), and these characteristics have also been 134 associated with increased severity of COVID-19 (6, 18). 135
To evaluate whether the spatial distribution and abundance of ACE2 protein in the lower 137 respiratory tract differed by age, sex, or presence of comorbidities, we scored tissues for ACE2 138 protein levels (Supplemental Table 2 ). In the cohort, neither age nor sex were associated with 139 ACE2 protein detection (using the median age as cut-off) (Figures 3c-d) . Since recent studies of 140 COVID-19 infections suggested that young children may have reduced disease severity when 141 infected by SARS-CoV-2 (6, 19), we compared lung tissue samples from children <10 years of 142 age to those from older subjects (19-71 years of age) and found that ACE2 protein detection was 143 higher in this subset of young children (Figure 3e ). To test whether ACE2 distribution was 144 affected by the presence of underlying diseases, we assessed the ACE2 localization pattern using 145 tissues from subjects with chronic comorbidities (asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic 146 obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and smokers) and compared them to 147 controls (Supplemental Table 2 ). The control group was similar in age to the chronic disease 148 group (Figure 3f ). We observed no significant differences between the two groups in ACE2 149 .

Through study of these respiratory tissues, we found that ACE2 protein was most 177 consistently detected in the sinonasal cavity and the alveoli. Expression of ACE2 in the nasal 178 cavity could explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, a cold-related 179 coronavirus, which also uses ACE2 as a receptor. One mystery is why SARS-CoV, which also 180 uses ACE2, was apparently unable to easily transmit from human-to-human (26). Whether this 181 represents differences in the interactions of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with co-receptors (27) 182 or other factors in the nasal cavity remains to be investigated. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 183 both replicate in the lungs (28, 29), consistent with the ACE2 distribution defined in this and 184 suggested by previous studies (9, 10). Most of the ACE2 expression in the lung was found in 185 AT2 cells, which are targets for SARS-CoV (30) and presumably SARS-CoV-2 (29). Given that 186 AT2 cells are critical for surfactant protein production and serve as progenitor cells for the AT1 187 cells, damage to these cells could contribute to acute lung injury (31), which is a common feature 188 of severe COVID-19 (5). Infection of AT2 cells could disrupt epithelial integrity leading to 189 alveolar edema, and facilitate viral spread to other epithelial cells or to ACE2 + interstitial 190 cells/vessels for systemic virus dissemination, given that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in 191 blood (32). Furthermore, cell-to-cell spread of coronaviruses after initial infection could also 192 occur via receptor-independent mechanisms related to the fusogenic properties of the S protein 193 (33).

In summary, we find that ACE2 protein has heterogeneous expression in the respiratory 212 tract with higher ACE2 detection in the sinonasal epithelium and AT2 cells that correlates with 213 putative sites for transmission and severe disease, respectively. The small subset of ACE2 + AT2 214 cells in the lung could be further studied to reveal factors regulating ACE2 expression and clarify 215 potential targets for antiviral therapies. 216

Studies on human tissues were approved by the institutional review board of the University of 229
Iowa. Tissues included nasal biopsies (n=3, deidentified and lacked evidence of significant 230 disease or cancer), lung donors, primary cell cultures (40), and autopsy tissues (control tissues) 231 that were selected from archival repositories as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks. Lung 232 cases were selected to comprise two case study groups: 1) Chronic disease group was defined as 233 having chronic comorbidities including: asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive 234 pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and smoking. 2) Control group was defined as 235 lacking these chronic comorbidities and lacking clinical lung disease. The cumulative cohort 236 included 29 cases (15 chronic comorbidities and 14 controls) with a broad range of ages (0.5 -237 71 years) and both sexes were represented (13 female and 16 male). For these lungs, if a trachea 238 or bronchus tissue block was available from the same case -these were included as well 239 (Supplemental Table 2 ). Bronchioles were observed in most lung sections and were defined as 240 intrapulmonary airways lacking evidence of cartilage or submucosal glands (41). 241 242 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence: 243
All formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (~4 µm) and hydrated through a 244 series of xylene and alcohol baths to water. Immunohistochemistry was then applied to these 245 studies to evaluate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (11), allograft inflammatory factor 246 1 (AIF1, also known as IBA1) (42), surfactant protein C (SP-C) (43) and mucin 5B (MUC5B) 247 (42). For more specifics about the reagents please see Supplemental Table 3 . 248 The eight donors varied from 21-63 years of age (median age = 48) and were composed of five 284 African American, one Asian, and two white donors, and 2 active, 1 former, and 5 never 285 smokers. Gene count matrices from the eight donors were aggregated for analysis. 286 287 All four data sets (bronchial biopsy, nasal brushing, turbinate, and lung parenchyma) were 288 processed in a similar manner. Gene-by-barcode count matrices were normalized, log-289 transformed, and scaled followed by dimension reduction using principal components analysis 290 (PCA). Principal components were used to obtain uniform manifold approximation and 291 projection (UMAP) visualizations, and cells were clustered using a shared nearest neighbor 292 (SNN) approach. Cell types associated with each cluster were identified by determining marker 293 genes for each cluster. All analyses were performed using R package Seurat version 3. 1.1 (45) . 294 .
