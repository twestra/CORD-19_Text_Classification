The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus -COVID-19-have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics using different scientific and technological approaches. One of those is by using mathematical and computational models like the compartmental model or the agent-based models. In this paper, a general agent-based model, called INFEKTA, that combines the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with agents (individuals) that can move on a complex network of accessible places defined over a Euclidean space representing a real town or city is proposed. The applicability of INFEKTA is shown by modeling the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia.
In this paper, we introduce an ABM, called INFEKTA (Esperanto word for 19 infectious), for modeling the transmission of infectious disease, applied to the 20 coronavirus COVID-19. INFEKTA models the disease transition at the person level and 21 takes into consideration individual infection disease incubation periods and evolution, 22 medical preconditions, age, daily routines (movements from house to destination places 23 and back, including transportation medium if required), and enforced social separation 24 policies.
Complex Systems Approaches for Epidemic Models 26 The complex system model approach considers a system as a large number of entities 27 (equally complex systems that have autonomous strategies and behaviors) that interact 28 with each other in local and non-trivial ways [9] [10] [11] . This approach provides a 29 conceptual structure (a multi-level complex network [12] ) that allows characterizing the 30 interrelation and interaction between elements of a system and between the system and 31 its environment [13] . In this way, a system is composed of sub-systems of second order, 32 which in turn may be composed of subsystems of the third-order [14] . Transmission 33 dynamics of infectious diseases are not traditionally modeled at the individual level, but 34 at the population-level with a compartmental model. However, some recent research use 35 agent-based modeling for doing that [15] .

Compartmental Model
A compartmental model tracks changes in compartments without specifying which 38 individuals are involved [16] and typically reflects health states relevant for transmission 39 (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered). Basically, these kinds of models 40 represent epidemics of the communicable disease using a population-based, non-spatial 41 approach. The conceptual framework for this approach is rooted in the general 42 population model which divides a population into different population 43 compartments [17]. Compartmentalization typically reflects health states relevant for 44 transmission (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered, in short SEIR), 45 though more partitioning is possible according to age and/or other relevant host 46 characteristics. Heterogeneous and temporal behavior is modeled through the 47 incorporation of relevant time-dependent social mixing, community structures and 48 seasonality, relevant for infectious disease dynamics [18, 19]. Process dynamics are 49 captured in transition rates, representing the rate by which an average individual 50 transitions between compartments.
51 Agent-based models for infectious disease 52 Agent-based models (ABMs) are a type of computer simulation for the creation, 53 disappearance, and movement of a finite collection of interacting individuals or agents 54 with unique attributes regarding spatial location, physiological traits and/or social 55 behavior [20-22]. ABMs work bottom-up, with population-level behavior emerging from 56 the interactions between autonomous individuals and their environment [22, 23]. They 57 allow the history of every individual to be tracked and network structures to be 58 explicitly represented.
59
In general, ABMs allow: i) To introduce local interaction rules at the individual 60 level, which closely coincide with physical and social interaction rules; (ii) To include 61 behaviors that may be randomized at the observational level, but can be deterministic 62 from a mathematical point of view; (iii) To incorporate a modular structure and to add 63 information through new types of individuals or by modifying current rules; and (iv) To 64
Infectious diseases have a substantial impact on public health, health care, 2 macroeconomics, and society. The availability of options to control and prevent the 3 emergence, expansion or resurgence of pathogens warrants continuous evaluation using 4 different methods. Mathematical models allow characterizing both the behavior and the 5 emergent properties of biological systems, such as the transmission of infectious 6 disease. [1] [2] [3] . Many biological systems have been modeled in terms of complexity since 7 their collective behavior cannot be simply inferred from the understanding of their 8 components [4, 5] . 9 Complex systems are computational approaches that make use of computer-based 10 algorithms to model dynamic interactions between individuals agents (e.g. persons, 11 cells) or groups and their properties, within, and across levels of influence [6, 7] . In 12 general, agent-based modeling (ABM) can be used for testing theories about underlying 13 interaction mechanics among the system's components and their resulting dynamics. It 14 can be done by relaxing assumptions and/or altering the interaction mechanisms at the 15 individual agent level. ABMs can increase our understanding of the mechanisms of 16 complex dynamic systems, and the results of the simulations may be used for predicting 17 future scenarios [8] .
observe systems dynamic that could not be inferred from the examination of the rules of 65 particular individuals [8] . 66 Because of the complex nature of interactions among individuals, an ABM may not 67 provide an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the complex system. 68 However, changes in the local rules repertoire of the individuals can be introduced into 69 the ABM to observe changes in the complex system [24] . 70 When ABM is used for epidemic modeling, infectious disease transmission dynamics 71 is expected to emerge from the interaction between local interactions between the The virtual space (for a city or town being studied) is a Euclidean complex network [12] : 87 Nodes are places (located in some position of the 2D Euclidean space) where individuals 88 can be at some simulation time and edges are routes (straight lines) connecting two 89 neighbor places. number of individuals that can be at some simulation step time). IPs and PTSs may be 95 restricted, during some period, to some or all individuals. Place restriction is 96 established according to the social separation rule that is enforced during such a period. 97
A PTS is a neighbor to another according to the public transportation system of the city 99 or town being studied. Homes and IPs are considered neighbors to its closest 1 PTS. No 100 home is neighbor to any other home neither an IP is neighbor of any other IP. Finally, a 101 home and an IP are considered neighbors if they are neighbors of the same PTS. The ability of an individual to move through space (we use the graph defining the space 121 for determining the route as proposed in [25, 26] ). Each individual has a mobility plan 122 for every day, plan that is carried on according to the enforced social separation 123 policy and her/his infectious disease state.
The mobility plan is modeled in INFEKTA as a collection of simple movement plans 125 to have i) Policy: social separation policy required for carrying on the mobility plan; 126 ii) Type: may be mandatory, i.e., must go to the defined interest place) or optional, 127 i.e., any place according to individual's preferences; iii) Day: day of the week the plan 128 is carried on, maybe every, week, weekend, Monday, ... , Sunday; iv) Going Hour; v) 129 Duration in hours for coming back to home; and vi) Place: if plan type is mandatory, 130 it is a specific place, otherwise it is an IP selected by the individual according to his/her 131 IP preferences. Critically-Infected (I C ), Recovered (R), and Dead (D). As can be noticed, we just 136 adapt the terminology from the compartmental models in epidemiology -namely, from 137 the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model. In INFEKTA, the 138 infectious state of the SEIR model is divided into exposed, seriously-infected and 139 critically infected in order to capture how age, gender, IP preferences, medical 140 preconditions (co-morbidity), and social separation policies can impact the evolution of 141 the infectious disease in an individual. INFEKTA introduces both the M state since 142 some individuals are naturally immune to or can become immune to (after recovering) 143 to certain infectious diseases and the Dead (D) state to distinguish between recovered 144 and dead individuals. Figure 1 shows the transition dynamics of the infectious disease 145 at the individual level in INFEKTA. 
• β: is the rate at which individuals move from the exposed (E) to the 160 Seriously-Infected state (I S ). It's reciprocal (1/β) is the average latent (exposed) 161 period.
• θ: is the rate at which individuals move from the Seriously-Infected (E) to the 163 Critically-Infected state (I S ). Its reciprocal (1/θ) is the average critical period.
• φ: is the death rate.
• ω: is the immune rate that incorporates the probability of becoming immune.
• T E : Time an individual will be at the Exposed state (E) before changing to the 167 Recovered (R) or Seriously Infected (I S ) states.
• T I S : Time an individual will be at the Seriously Infected state (I S ) before 169 changing to the Recovered (R) or Critically Infected (I C ) states.
• T I C : Time an individual will be at the Critically Infected (I C ) before changing to 171 the Recovered (R) or Dead (D) states.
• T R : Time an individual will be at the Recovered state (R) before changing to the 173 Susceptible (S) or Immune (M ) states.
INFEKTA can consider that two individuals were close enough for interacting at the 175 transmission of the infectious disease if they were at the same place (home, interest 176 place or public transportation station) at the same time or if they were close enough (in 177 the Euclidean space) while moving.

The INFEKTA implementation of the COVID-19 propagation model for Bogotá city is 251 implemented using the simulation modeling software tool AnyLogic, see S1 Simulator.
Also, the methodology (Data preprocessing; places, population, and routes assignation; 253 network creation) is available in a Github repository, see S2 Repository. 254 Figure 4 shows the initial configuration of virtual individuals in the simulation, 255 represented as small points. All of them are initially assigned to homes, and almost all 256 of them are in the Susceptible state (S) (green points). Just ten (10) individuals are 257 considered at state Exposed (E). shows the COVID-19 dynamics after 400 simulated hours. At this time, all individuals 263 have been Exposed (yellow points), meaning that some individuals are seriously infected 264 (red points), critically infected (dark red points), recovered (blue points), and few of 265 them become immune (purple points). Figure 5 (right) shows the COVID-19 dynamics 266 after 800 simulated hours. Notice that, the virus has already peaked once and the first 267 wave is over. The propagation is now stable and 20% of the population is now immune 268 to the virus. As expected, the number of exposed, seriously and critically infected cases 269 grows exponentially when a social separation policy is not enforced. Clearly, the .

We analyze the sensitivity of some parameters to check the robustness of the model. 273 Sensitivity to infection rate is shown in Figure 6 . Notice that by increasing or Sensitive to recovery time (T R ) is shown in Figure 7 . If the recovery time is reduced 281 to 2 days (Figure 7 (left) ) there is not a significant difference in the epidemic behavior 282 respect to the predefined 5 days. However, if recovery time is increased to 10 days 283 (Figure 7 (right) ) the transmission disease dynamics show a second peak after 500 hours 284 (approx 21 days). 
Modeling the Transmission dynamic of an infectious disease such as the COVID-19 is 295 not an easy task due to its highly complex nature. When using an agent-based model, 296 several different characteristics can be modeled, for example, the demographic 297 information of the population being studied, the set of places and the mobility of agents 298 in the city or town under consideration, social separation rules that may be enforced, 299 and the special characteristics of the infectious disease being modeled. INFEKTA is a 300 general agent-based model that allows researches to combine and study all of those 301 characteristics. .

Therefore, INFEKTA may be able to provide more 310 accurate results if its parameters are set to real ones: disease transmission rates, virus, 311 incubation periods, comorbidity, houses, interest places, routines, population size (close 312 to nine millions of virtual individuals for the Bogotá city).
Our future work will concentrate on studying the transmission of COVID-19 in 314 Bogotá city by considering different scenarios of social separation rules and by using 315 more realistic information about: i) Relation between personal information and 316 propagation rates of the COVID-19, ii) Places and routes, iii) Population size, and iv) 317 Age and Medical preconditions.
