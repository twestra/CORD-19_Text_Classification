Background: After the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is exhibiting a 7 clear regional trend with Northern areas being the most affected in terms of both frequency and 8 severity of cases. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role 9 has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution.
contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory 23 responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the 24 capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric 25 and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable 26 development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads. 27 Keywords: COVID-19; Atmospheric Pollution; Pandemic risk; Italy 28 .

This virus was termed SARS-CoV-2 for its similarity with that responsible of the 32 global epidemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred between 2002 and 2003 (Xu 33 et al., 2020). Patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced serious complications, 34 including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary oedema, severe pneumonia and acute respiratory 35 stress syndrome which in several cases were fatal Sohrabi et al., 2020 The drastic containment measures adopted by Chinese government did not prevent the 42 diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, which in a few weeks has spread globally. Italy was the first country in 43 Europe to be affected by the epidemic COVID-19, with an outbreak even larger than that originally The percentage of European population exposed to levels higher than the regulatory limits 82 is about 7-8% for NO2, 6-8% for PM2.5, 13-19% for PM10 and 12-29% for O3 (EEA, 2019). Premature 83 deaths due to acute respiratory diseases from such pollutants are estimated to be over to two .
