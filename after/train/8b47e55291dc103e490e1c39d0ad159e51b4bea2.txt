Serological tests are crucial tools for assessments of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, infection and potential immunity. Their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate assay performance data.
We conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two ELISAs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The specimen set comprised 130 plasma or serum samples from 80 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; 108 pre-COVID-19 negative controls; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples were blinded and LFA results were interpreted by two independent readers, using a standardized intensity scoring system.
Among specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals, the percent seropositive increased with time interval, peaking at 81.8-100.0% in samples taken >20 days after symptom onset.
Test specificity ranged from 84.3-100.0% in pre-COVID-19 specimens. Specificity was higher when weak LFA bands were considered negative, but this decreased sensitivity. IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and detection was highest when IgM and IgG results were combined. Agreement between ELISAs and LFAs ranged from 75.8-94.8%. No consistent cross-reactivity was observed.
Our evaluation showed heterogeneous assay performance. Reader training is key to reliable LFA performance, and can be tailored for survey goals. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence. Well-designed studies to elucidate the mechanisms and serological correlates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies.
As of April 23, 2020, more than 190,000 deaths have been attributed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 Millions of infections by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, have been reported, though its full extent has yet to be determined due to limited testing. 2 Government interventions to slow viral spread have disrupted daily life and economic activity for billions of people. Strategies to ease restraints on human mobility and interaction, without provoking major resurgence of transmission and mortality, will depend on accurate estimates of population levels of infection and immunity. 3 Current testing for the virus largely depends on labor-intensive molecular techniques. 4 Individuals with positive molecular tests represent only a small fraction of all infections, given limited deployment and the brief time window when PCR testing is sensitive. [5] [6] [7] The proportion of undetected cases in the original epidemic focus was estimated to be as high as 86%, 8 and asymptomatic infections are suspected to play a substantial role in transmission. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Widely available, reliable antibody detection assays would enable more accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and incidence. On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, 15 allowing nucleic acid detection and immunoassay tests to be offered based on manufacturer-reported data without formal FDA clearance. 16 In response, dozens of companies have begun to market laboratory-based immunoassays and point-of-care tests. Rigorous, comparative performance data are crucial to inform clinical care and public health response.

We conducted a head-to-head comparison of available serology tests -immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) -including an evaluation of performance by time from symptom onset and disease severity. Our goal is to provide well-controlled performance data to highlight potentially useful serological assays, and to help guide their development and deployment.
Ethical approvals: This study was approved by institutional review boards at the University of individual, but no more than one sample per time interval (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 , and >20 days after symptom onset). If an individual had more than one specimen for a given time interval, only the later specimen was included. For specificity, we included 108 pre-COVID-19 specimens from American Red Cross blood donors. 17 We assessed cross-reactivity using 52 specimens from 2020: 50 with test results for other respiratory viruses (Biofire FilmArray;
BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT), and 32 from individuals with negative results by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. We based minimum sample size calculations on expected binomial exact 95% confidence limits. A total of 290 samples were included in the final analysis, including 130 from 80 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals. Some specimens were .

Clinical data were extracted from electronic health records and entered in a HIPAA-secure REDCap database hosted by UCSF. Data included demographic information, major comorbidities, patient-reported symptom onset date, symptoms and indicators of severity.
Independent data from testing efforts at MGH, with slight deviations in methods, are included as Supplementary Data. Briefly, 57 heat-inactivated serum/plasma samples from 44 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals were included. For specificity, the MGH study included 60 heatinactivated, pre-COVID-19 samples from 30 asymptomatic adults and 30 individuals admitted with febrile and/or respiratory illness with a confirmed pathogen.
Sample Preparation: Samples from UCSF and ZSFG were assigned a random well position in one of four 96-well plates. Samples were thawed at 37°C, and up to 200uL was transferred to the assigned well without heat inactivation. Samples were then sub-aliquoted (12.5uL) to replica plates for testing. Replica plates were stored at -20°C until needed, then thawed for ten minutes at room temperature and briefly centrifuged before testing. All sample handling followed UCSF Biosafety Committee-approved Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) practices.
For the MGH study, samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 60 minutes, aliquoted, and stored at 4°C and -20°C. Samples stored at 4°C were used within 7 days. Frozen aliquots were stored until needed with only a single freeze-thaw cycle for any sample. All samples were brought to room temperature and briefly centrifuged prior to adding the recommended volume to the LFA cartridge.

For both ELISAs, background-corrected OD values were divided by the cutoff to generate signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratios. Samples with S/CO values greater than 1.0 were considered positive.
Data Analysis: For LFA testing, the second reader's scores were used for performance calculations, and the first reader's score was used to calculate inter-reader agreement statistics.
Percent seropositivity among RT-PCR-confirmed cases was calculated by time interval from symptom onset. Specificity was based on results in pre-COVID-2019 samples. Binomial exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all estimates. Analyses were conducted in R (3.6.3) and SAS (9.4).
Study population: SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals in the UCSF/ZSFG study ranged from 22 to >90 years of age ( Figure 1A ), reaching the highest levels in the 16-20 and >20 day time intervals. The highest detection rate was achieved by combining IgM and IgG results ( Figure   1B ). However, 95% confidence intervals for later time intervals showed substantial overlap with those for earlier intervals ( Figure 1B ). Four assays (Bioperfectus, Premier, Wondfo, in-house .

Some tests were not performed on a subset of specimens due exhausted sample material, which may have affected reported percent positivity. IgM detection was less consistent than IgG for nearly all assays. Kappa agreement statistic ranged from 0.95 to 0.99 for IgG and 0.81-1.00 for IgM for standardized intensity score and training (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). Although variability in mean band intensities exists among different assays, the rate of sample positivity was generally consistent ( Figure 2 ).
We observed a trend towards higher percent positivity by LFA for patients admitted to ICU compared to those with milder disease, but the specimen numbers per time interval were low, limiting statistical power (Supplementary Figure 3) .
Test specificity ranged from 84.3%-100.0%, with 39/108 samples demonstrating false positive results by at least one LFA (Table 2 and Figure 2B ). Of the false positive results, 61.5% (24/39) had a weak positive score (1). Intensity scores of 2-3 were seen in 30.8% (12/39) and scores of 4-6 were seen in 7.7% (3/39) of the positives from the pre-COVID-19 samples.
We evaluated the tradeoff between percent positivity and specificity as a function of LFA reader score. Changing the positive LFA threshold from 1 to 2 decreased the mean overall percent positivity across tests from 66.0% (range: 56.9%-74.2%) to 56.7% (range: 44.0%-64.6%) and increased the average specificity from 94.6% (range: 84.3%-100.0%) to 98.2% (range: 94.4%-100.0%) (Supplementary Figure 4 ). An independent study at MGH compared three LFAs, of which BioMedomics was also assessed in the current study (Supplementary Table 3 ). Overall, .

Agreement between results of LFAs with those of IgG and IgM Epitope ELISAs ranged from 75.8%-85.7%, while agreement with the in-house ELISA ranged from 83.6%-94.8% ( Figure   3A ). LFA band intensity scores showed a direct correlation with ELISA S/CO values ( Figure   3B ).
This study describes test performance for 12 COVID-19 serology assays on a panel of 130 samples from 80 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 108 pre-COVID-19 specimens. For each test, we quantified detection of IgM and/or IgG antibodies by time period from onset of symptoms and assessed specificity and cross-reactivity.

This study also seeks to provide feedback to manufacturers about areas of success and necessary improvement. There is no "gold standard" to identify true seropositive blood samples. The extent and time-course of antibody development are not fully understood as yet, and may vary between different populations, even among RT-PCR-confirmed cases.
We focused on comparisons of percent positivity by time interval, rather than reporting the "sensitivity" of each assay. As expected, percent positivity rose with time after symptom onset. 5,6,21-23 High rates of positive results were not reached until at least 2 weeks into clinical illness; diagnosis at time of symptom onset thus remains dependent on viral detection methods.
The assays showed a trend to higher positive rates within time intervals for more severe disease, but this finding should be interpreted with caution, due to the limited data from ambulatory cases. The majority of samples >20 days post-symptom onset had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting good to excellent sensitivity for all evaluated tests in hospitalized patients three or more weeks into their disease course. However, well-powered studies testing ambulatory or asymptomatic individuals, including performance with capillary blood, will be essential to guide appropriate use of serology.
Our data demonstrate specificity greater than 95% for the majority of tests evaluated and >99% for 2 LFAs (Wondfo, Sure Biotech) and the in-house ELISA (adapted from Amanat et al, 2020) 18 . We observed moderate-to-strong positive bands in several pre-COVID-19 blood donor specimens, some of them positive by multiple assays, suggesting the possibility of non-specific binding of plasma proteins, non-specific antibodies, or cross-reactivity with other viruses. Three of the pre-COVID-19 specimens (2.3%) were scored positive by more than three assays.
Intriguingly, the fraction of positive tests was higher in a set of recent specimens obtained during . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Five of these (9.6%) had positive results by more than three assays, without relation to a specific viral pathogen, suggesting non-specific reactivity and/or missed COVID-19 diagnoses. One specimen was positive by 8 of 12 assays, including the inhouse ELISA. The patient was >90 years old and presented with altered mental status, fever, and High specificity testing is crucial in low-prevalence settings. One approach to increase specificity would employ confirmatory testing with an independent assay (perhaps recognizing a distinct epitope or antigen).

Detection cutoffs should be selected recognizing the likely tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity, the population prevalence, and the goals of testing. Accurate LFA use also depends on adequate reader training and standardized intensity cutoffs. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation of alternative implementation algorithms in multiple settings.
Our study also reinforces the need for assay validation using standardized sample sets with: 1) known positives from individuals with a range of clinical presentations at multiple time points after onset of symptoms, 2) pre-COVID-19 outbreak samples for specificity, and 3) samples from individuals with other viral and inflammatory illnesses as cross-reactivity controls.
Coordinated efforts to validate and ensure widespread availability of such standardized sample sets would facilitate effective utilization. We will continue to evaluate serology assays, and provide updated data on a dedicated website (https://covidtestingproject.org). Current and future studies by our group and others will provide an essential evidence base to guide serological testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
