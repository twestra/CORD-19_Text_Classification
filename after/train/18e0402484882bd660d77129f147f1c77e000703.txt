Introduction: Spain has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with 28 the second highest death toll in the world after Italy. Here we analyzed estimates of pandemic 29 severity and investigated how different factors shaped the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. 30
We retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 31 cases and deaths in Spain from February 20, 2020 to April 2, 2020. We used statistical methods 32 to estimate the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio (CFR) for 17 autonomous communities 33 and 2 autonomous cities of Spain. We then assessed how transmission and sociodemographic 34 variables were associated with the CFR across areas in Spain using multivariate regression 35
Results: We estimated the highest time-delay-adjusted CFR for Madrid (38.4%) and the 37 average adjusted CFR in Spain at 23.9%. Our multivariate regression analysis revealed a 38 statistically significant three predictor variables: infant mortality rate, poverty risk rate and the 39 cumulative morbidity rate. 40
Our estimates of the time-delay adjusted CFR for 12 autonomous communities/cities in Spain 42 are significantly higher than those previously estimated for other geographic regions including 43
China and Korea. Our results call for urgent public health interventions focusing on low 44 socioeconomic groups to ameliorate the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.
African autonomous cities whereas the 17 CCAA include: Andalucía, Aragon, Asturias, 94 Balears, Canarias, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y Leon, Catalunya, C. Valenciana, 95 Extremadura, Galicia, Madrid, Murcia, Navarra, Pais Vasco, La Rioja [16] . 96 Initial cases of COVID-19 in Spain: The first case of COVID-19 in Spain was confirmed on 31st 97 January, 2020 in La Gomera, Canary Islands in a person who was in contact with an infected 98 person while in Germany [17] . By February 27, there were total 12 cases which increased to 45 99 cases in March 1 and then continued to rise rapidly throughout the country [18] . 100 Data Sources:
The Ministry of Health of Spain releases daily report on COVID-19 cases and deaths [19] . 102
From these reports we retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of reported 103 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from February 20, 2020 to April 2, 2020. 104 .

We also obtained the data 110 on the total area of each CCAA [21] , and percentage of total consolidated expenditure on 111 hospital and specialized services in the CCAA from the annual report issued by the national 112 health system, 2018 [22] . Finally, we also included two transmission-related metrics: the 113 COVID-19 initial growth rate during the 15 days of local transmission and the cumulative 114 morbidity rate given by the cumulative number cases divided by the local population size. 115
Additionally, we obtained the shapefiles of the autonomous communities of Spain from the 116 national geographic information system of Spain [23] . 117 118 Time-delay adjusted CFR estimation 119 120
The crude CFR is defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of 121 cumulative cases at a specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we 122 employed the delay from hospitalization to death, h s , which is assumed to be given by h s = H(s) 123 -H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) is a cumulative density function of the delay from hospitalization 124 .

Let π a,ti be the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio on 126 reported day t i in area a, the likelihood function of the estimate π a,ti is 127
where c a,t represents the number of new cases with reported day t in area a, and D a,ti is the 128 cumulative number of deaths until reported day t i in area a [14, 15] . Among the cumulative 129 cases with reported day t in area a, D a,ti have died and the remainder have survived the 130 infection. The contribution of those who have died with biased death risk is shown in the 131 middle parenthetical term and the contribution of survivors is presented in the right 132 parenthetical term. We assume that D a,ti is the result of the binomial sampling process with 133 probability π a,ti . 134 135 We estimated model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a 136 Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated by 137 sampling from the three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples from the 138 posterior distribution after a burn-in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains were 139 evaluated using the potential scale reduction statistic [24, 25] . Estimates and 95% credibility 140 .

We also explored the association between time-delay-adjusted CFR with population size, 145 population density, proportion of population aged more than 60 years, infant mortality rate, 146 population at risk of poverty as measured by poverty risk rate, consolidated public health 147 expenditure on hospital and specialized services as well as with two transmission-related 148 metrics: the cumulative morbidity rate of COVID-19 and the initial incidence growth rate 149 across CCAAs. For this analysis, we built a multivariate linear regression model with all 150 predictor variables to identify simplified models with significant factors linked to the variation 151 in CFR estimates across geographic areas in Spain. We used stepwise regression method to 152 build a final model that contained significant predictors. 153

As of April 2, a total of 117,710 cases and 10,935 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported 158 in Spain. Moreover, the Madrid region has reported the highest number of cases at 34,188 159 .

For AN, AS, CN, CB, CE, GA, ME, MC, and NC the 179 time-delay-adjusted CFR are slightly higher than the crude CFR. Similarly, for IB the 180 model-based estimates fit very well with the crude estimate. The graph of the time-delay 181 adjusted CFR varies considerably for different areas. For instance, as the epidemic progresses, 182 the adjusted CFR increases slightly in CN and NC while it shows the upward trend for first two 183 weeks and then declines very slowly as in MD. For CM the graph shows upward trend for first 184 two weeks, followed by a relative decline and then again moves upwards and then stays stable. 185
Likewise, for AR, there was a very high early death rate for first two weeks after which it 186 started to decline. 187 188 A summary of the time delay adjusted case fatality ratio, range of median estimates and crude 189 CFR of COVID-19 across different areas of Spain are presented in Table 1 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We also observed a significant positive association of the time-delay adjusted CFR 212 estimates across 17 Spanish areas with two socio-demographic factors: infant mortality rate, 213 and poverty risk rate while cumulative morbidity rate was also positively associated with CFR. 214
Our findings suggest the need for additional control efforts and medical resources particularly 215 for lower socio-economic areas which have been particularly hit hard by the COVID-19 216 pandemic. 217 .

Infant 237 mortality rate is an important indicator of an overall health of society while poverty risk rate 238 reflects the socio-economic status of an area. In any pandemic situation like COVID-19, the 239 poorer tend to exhibit the highest morbidity and mortality rates. For instance, lower 240 socioeconomic groups were also disproportionately affected by the 1918 influenza pandemic 241 In our study we saw considerable variations in CFR trend across areas. For instance, as the 254 epidemic progressed, the adjusted CFR showed a slightly upward trend in CN and NC, a rapid 255 .

Likewise, for 256 CM the graph showed an upward trend followed by a relative decline and then again an upward 257 trend before staying stable. The CFR trend for the 19 autonomous areas can be helpful in the 258 planning and implementation of health care services and prevention measures separately for 259 each of them. The downward trend in CFR as seen in some of the areas in our study suggest the 260 improvement in epidemiologic surveillance leading to the increased capture of mild or 261 asymptomatic cases. A higher number of mild and asymptomatic cases also indicate an 262 increase in human-to-human transmission leading to a prolonged epidemic which can be 263 In China, of 44672 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 3.8% was among the health care personnel 273 .

The preferential ascertainment of severe cases bias in 277 COVID-19 may have spuriously increased our estimate of CFR [3] , which is a frequent caveat 278 in this type of studies [43, 44] . Similarly, given the long infection-death time for which ranges between 2 to 8 weeks [29], our estimate may have been affected by delayed 280 reporting bias [3, 5] . Similarly, in our data, the date of report reflects the date of reporting and 281 not the date of onset of illness. Finally, we assumed infant mortality and poverty risk rate as a 282 proxy for areas with low socio-economic groups. 283 284
The risk of death due to COVID-19 in Spain was estimated at 23.9%, but estimates varied 286 substantially across 19 geographic areas. The CFR was as high as 38% in Madrid (38.4%), and 287
Castilla-La Mancha areas and as low as 4% in Melilla and 8% in Galicia and Murcia. Of the 19 288 autonomous areas/cities, 16 had a time-delay-adjusted CFR greater than 10% reflecting a 289 disproportionate severity burden of COVID-19 in Spain. Importantly, our estimate of CFR for 290 the most affected Madrid region is higher than previous estimates for the most affected areas 291 within China, Korea, and Italy.
