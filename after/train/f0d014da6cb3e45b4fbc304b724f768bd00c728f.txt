Monitoring the mutation dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to contain the 20 pathogen. By analyzing 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences, we provided direct genetic evidence that 21 SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS. Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative 22
Highlights
• Based on the currently available genome sequence data, we proved that SARS-COV-2 genome has a much lower 31 mutation rate and genetic diversity than SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak. 32
• The spike (S) protein encoding gene of SARS-COV-2 is found relatively more conserved than other protein-encoding 33 genes, which is a good indication for the ongoing antiviral drug and vaccine development. 34
• Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage 35 spread history. 36
• We confirmed a previously reported rearrangement in the S protein arrangement of SARS-COV-2, and propose that 37 this rearrangement should have occurred between human SARS-CoV and a bat SARS-CoV, at a time point much 38 earlier before SARS-COV-2 transmission to human. 39
• We provided first evidence that a mutated SARS-COV-2 with reduced human ACE2 receptor binding affinity have 40 emerged in India based on a sample collected on 27 th January 2020. 41 42
original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage spread history. The discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its 23 receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of SARS- Despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly more conserved, we identified a mutation that 25 leads to weaker receptor binding capability, which concerns a SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on 27 th January 2020 from 26
India. This represents the first report of a significant SARS-CoV-2 mutant, and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine 27 development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified. 28 29

As of 4 th April 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infection has reached over 45 1.05 million cases globally, claiming 56,985 lives (Coronavirus disease 2019, Situation Report-15, WHO). Most 46 concerning is that this number is predicted to continue rising significantly in the next couple of months. Scientists have 47 been working round the clock to understand how the virus spreads and evolves. There is an imminent challenge to develop 48 effective approaches to contain the rapid spread of this pathogen. 49 50 In addition to the traditional control methods, such as travel ban and house isolation, which have clear negative impact on 51 economy and disrupt normal social activities, the development of antiviral drugs and vaccine should be the ultimate solution 52 to contain the epidemic and reduce the fatality (1, 2). Similar to other SARS-like CoVs (3, 4), SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike 53 (S) protein to bind and invade human cells (5, 6). The S protein and its host receptor are the key targets for drug design and 54 vaccine development (7, 8) . Recently, several 3D protein structures of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-55 2 spike protein have been determined (5, 6, 9) . The structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 has become 56 clear (6, 9) . This laid the foundation for future vaccine development. 57 58 Vaccine utilizes the human immune system and is specific to the viral-encoded peptides (10). One of the major concerns 59 for antiviral vaccine development is the constant emergence of new mutations, which may make vaccine not effective for 60 future epidemic (7, 10). A prominent example is that, new Influenza viruses arise every year, requiring new immunization 61 (11). SARS-CoV-2 belong to the single-stranded RNA virus, whose genome can readily mutate as virus spreads (12, 13) . 62
Interestingly, initial assessment of the first 9 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence revealed a low level of mutation rate (14). A 63 recent article by Washington Post reported that the mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low despite its rapid spread, 64 which suggests that only a single vaccine may be required for SARS-CoV-2. However, these results may be based on 65 limited genomic data in the early stage of virus development. It is critical to study and monitor the mutation dynamics of 66 SARS-COV-2. 67 68 Taking advantage of the increasing amount of genomic data collected around the world, we set to explore the current status 69 of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, assess the mutation rate, and potentially identify the emergence of novel mutations that 70 .

A total of 106 complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genome data covering over 12 countries 71 was downloaded from public database. The genetic diversity profile and evolutionary rate for each protein-encoding gene 72 were characterized. Phylogenetic analyses in this study revealed clue to the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in some 73 countries. Most importantly, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 mutation with likely reduced human angiotensin-converting 74 enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding affinity. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate but also proved that 75 novel mutation with varied virulence and immune characteristics have already emerged. 76 77
The latest sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS was retrieved from NCBI public database at 80 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/. The 5UTR, 3UTR, and CDS sequences of the reference SARS-81
CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) and the human SARS genome (NC_004718.3) were used to blastn against the available 82 genome data. The homology search targets were restricted to the complete or near-complete genomes for further analyses. 83
The assessment of sequence conservation was performed using the PLOTCON tool from the The European Molecular 85 Biology Open Software Suite at https://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/plotcon. The gene model of SARS-CoV-2 86 was generated using the AnnotationSketch (15) tool based on the genome annotation data downloaded from NCBI database. 87
Codon-based sequence alignment was performed for the conserved domain sequences (CDS) using MUSCLE program 89 (limited to 2 iterations for fast alignment of long sequences) (16). Alignment of the 5UTR and 3UTR sequences were 90 performed separately. The obtained alignment files were concatenated for final phylogeny construction. The phylogenetic 91 tree was developed in MEGA7.0 (17) using the Minimum Evolution method with p-distance substitution model, and the 92 maximum Likelihood method (HKY+G+I, 500 times bootstrap test) for the S protein analyses. Tree annotation was carried 93 out using Figtree software ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ). 94 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The ratio of nonsynonymous mutations (dN) to synonymous mutations (dS) was calculated using codeml in the PAML 96 (version 4.7) package (18). CDS sequences for each protein encoding gene were filtered to remove redundant identical 97 sequences. Then codon-based CDS sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE program, and an individual NJ 98 tree was generated using MEGA7.0 (17) with p-distance model. The obtained sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree 99 files were used as PAML inputs for dN and dS calculations. 
As of 24 th March 2020, there are a total of 174 nucleotide sequences for SARS-CoV-2 in the NCBI database. By restricting 113 to the complete or near-complete genomes, 106 sequences from 12 countries were obtained and used for further analyses. 114
This encompasses 54 records from USA, 35 from China, and the rest from other countries: Australia (1), Brazil (2), Finland 115
(1), India (2), Italy (1), Nepal (1), Spain (3), South Korea (1), and Sweden (1). 116
Based on the gene model of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (GeneBank: NC_045512.2), a total of 12 protein-encoding 117 open reading frames (ORFs), plus 5UTR and 3UTR were annotated ( Figure 1A) . Overall, the gene sequences from 118 different samples are highly homologous, sharing > 99.1% identity, with the exception of 5UTR (96.7%) and 3UTR (98%) 119 .

Sequence alignment showed that there is no mutation in ORF6, ORF7a, 120 and ORF7b. The genetic diversity profile across the 106 genomes was displayed in Figure 1A . A few nucleotide sites 121 within ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3a, and ORF8 exhibiting high genetic diversity were identified ( Figure 1A) . 122

To assess how the mutation rate and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations (dN) and 138 synonymous mutations (dS), was calculated for each protein-encoding ORF based on the 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS 139 genomes. For SARS-CoV-2, the highest dN was observed for ORF8 (0.0111), followed by ORF1a (0.0081), ORF9 (0.0079), 140 and ORF4 (0.0063) ( Table 1) , indicating these genes may be more likely to accumulate nonsynonymous mutations. In 141 contrast, ORF1b (0.0029), S gene (0.0040) encoding the spike protein, and ORF5 (0.0023) are relatively more conserved 142 in terms of nonsynonymous mutation. Noteworthy, ORF6, ORF7ab and ORF10 are strictly conserved with no 143 nonsynonymous mutation. Compared to SARS-CoV-2, SARS displayed higher mutation rates for all of the ORFs in the 144 virus genome (Table 1) , suggesting an overall higher levels of genetic diversity and mutation rate. In particular, the dN and 145 dS values for the S gene in SARS-CoV is around 12 and 7 times higher than that for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the mutation 146 rate differences for ORF1a and ORF1b between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS are relatively milder, varying from 1.5 times to 147 4.8 times only. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has strictly conserved ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b, SARS displayed 148 mutation rates at different levels. Notably, the dS for ORF10 are comparable between the two genomes at 0.0326 and 0.0341, 149 respectively. 150 151
To trace the potential spread history of SARS-CoV-2 across the world, an unrooted Minimum Evolution (ME) tree of the 153 106 genomes was developed based on whole-genome sequence alignment. The clustering pattern of the ME phylogeny 154 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034942 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Figure 2) shed light on how the virus may have spread at the early stage. At the center of the ME tree, a number of virus 155 accessions collected from China (including the reference genome NC_045512.2) and USA have the shortest branch 156 (marked by red and black dots), thus may indicate the original status of SARS-CoV-2. The radial pattern, instead of 157 clustering together, of these accessions and other accessions derived from the tree center (highlighted in yellow color) with 158 longer branches, implies the independent mutations occurring during the virus spread (Figure 2) . However, the longer 159 branch may not be always associated with a longer evolution time, as some accessions collected in December 2019 have 160 equal or even longer branch that those collected in January and February 2020. 161
Due to the data availability, virus accessions collected from China and USA are dominant in the ME tree and constantly 162 group with accessions from other countries. Overall, the target SARS-CoV-2 genomes tend to separate into two major 163 clusters (highlighted in yellow dots, Figure 2 ), suggesting these SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from two major spread 164 sources. Of particular interest is the observation of several phylogenetic clades encompassing samples collected from more 165 than one countries, which may provide clue to track the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in these countries.

The spike glycoprotein is critical for the virus infection. Recent study suggested that the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 may 185 has underwent a structural rearrangement(13). To investigate this hypothesis, two separate phylogenies were developed 186 based on the full-S and RBD sequences, respectively. Overall, the two phylogenies displayed similar clustering patterns, 187 separating into three major clades (Figure 3) . SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the same major clade, and was clustered most 188 closely with two bat SARS CoVs (highlighted in purple and green colors, Figure 3 ) and the human SARS-CoV (orange 189 color, Figure 3) . In both phylogenies, SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to bat_CoV_RaTG13, suggesting SARS-CoV-190 2 may have originated from bat. However, the evolutionary positions of human SARS-CoV and bat-SL-CoVZ45 were 191 swapped between the full-S and RBD-only phylogenies. In the full-S phylogeny, bat-SL-CoVZ45 is relatively more similar 192 to human SARS-CoV-2, whilst human SARS-CoV is closer to SARS-CoV-2 than bat-SL-CoVZ45. Taken together, these 193 .

The 3D structure 205 of the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6VW1) has recently been determined in complex with human ACE2 206 receptor (6). One of the12 amino acid mutations in the RBD of S protein (R408I) was identified among the 106 SARS-207
CoV-2 genomes. Sequence alignment showed that 408R is strictly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat SARS-208 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 like CoV (Figure 4A) . Based on the determined CoV2_RBD-ACE2 complex structure, 408R is located at the interface 209 between RBD and ACE2, but is positioned relatively far away from ACE2, thus does not have direct interaction with ACE2 210 ( Figure 4B) . However, the determined RBD0-ACE2 structure showed that 408R forms a hydrogen bond (3.3 Å in length) 211 with the glycan attached to 90N from ACE2 ( Figure 4C ) (6). The hydrogen bond may have contributed to the exceptionally 212 higher ACE2 binding affinity. In contrast, despite this arginine residue is also conserved in human SARS-CoV 213 (corresponding to 395R in PDB: 2AJF), it is positioned relatively distant (6.1 Å) from the glycan bound to 90N from ACE2 214 ( Figure S1) . Interestingly, the 408R-glycan hydrogen bond seem to be disrupted by the R408I mutation in one SARS-CoV-215 2 accession (GeneBank ID: MT012098.1) (Figure 4D) , which was collected from India on 27 th Jan 2020. Furthermore, in 216 contrast to the arginine residue, which is electrically charged and highly hydrophilic, the mutated isoleucine residue has a 217 highly hydrophobic side chain with no hydrogen-bond potential ( Figure 4E ). To sum up, the R408I mutation identified 218 from the SARS-CoV-2 strain in India represents a SARS-CoV-2 mutant with potentially reduced ACE2 binding affinity. 219 220 221

Based on the currently available genome sequence data, our results showed that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much 229 lower than that for SARS, which caused the 2002-2003 outbreak. Our study is the first to provide a direct quantitative 230 comparison between SARS-COV-2 and SARS. A relatively stable genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a good indication for the 231 epidemic control, as less mutation raises the hope of the rapid development of validate vaccine and antiviral drugs. Our 232 results are consistent with several recent genetic variance analyses on SARS- 20) , which suggested the SARS-233
CoV-2 genomes are highly homogeneous. Molecular geneticists closely monitoring the virus development also suggested 234 that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 maintains at a low level. Whilst it is generally safe to say that SARS-CoV-2 tends 235 to mutate at a low rate, all current analyses are merely based on data collected at the early stage of this pandemic. As the 236 virus continues to spread rapidly around the world, and more genomic data is accumulated, the evolution and mutation 237 dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 still need to be monitored closely. 238
One critical aim of our study is to identify the original status of SARS-CoV-2 before its wide transmission across different 240 countries. Due to the short time space of sample collection and a relatively low mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2, we believe 241 that a Minimum Evolution phylogeny may outperform other phylogenetic methods to achieve this aim. As expected, the 242 earliest few reported SARS-CoV-2 accessions collected from Wuhan China were identified at the center of the phylogenetic 243 tree with the shortest branch. Interestingly, a number of virus genomes from USA were found almost identical to these 244 putative original versions of virus from Wuhan. However, according to public media, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in USA 245 occurred relatively later than other countries. One possible explanation for this observation is that, the spread of SARS-246
CoV-2 in USA might start much earlier than previously thought or reported. Due to a dominant proportion of the samples 247 in this study were collected from China and USA, we observed a significantly higher level of genetic diversity from these 248 two countries. Most SARS-CoV-2 accessions from the other countries can find their closely related sisters from either 249
China or USA. This data bias, on the other hand, may give us an advantage to trace the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in 250 different countries. This suggestion is reliable because all of the samples studies in this study were collected at the early 251 stage of the pandemic, which may avoid the potential data noise caused by recent published genomes of complex spread 252 background. One notable finding in our phylogenetic tree is that, the singleton SARS-CoV-2 accessions collected from 253 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
