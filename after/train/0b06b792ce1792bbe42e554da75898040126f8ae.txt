To make these risk assessments, we applied a model that we developed for another silent spreader-Zika-which threatened to emerge in southern US states in 2016 1 . Using stochastic simulations, we determine the probability that a county already has an ongoing COVID-19 epidemic by the time the county reports just one, two, three or more cases. The levels of risk displayed in Figure 1 are based on reported cases as of April 13, 2020 2 and account for under-reporting, the uncertainty in the transmission rate of COVID-19, the likelihood of super-spreading events--like those that fueled SARS outbreaks in 2003 and have been reported recently for COVID-19 3 --and the impact of social distancing measures that have been enacted across the US in recent weeks (see Supplemental Appendix).
By the time a first case of COVID-19 is reported in the county, we estimate that there is over a 50% chance that a full-blown epidemic is underway. We found 85% of US counties with 96% of the national population have reported at least one case ( Figure 1 ). Even counties that have not yet reported a confirmed case have an estimated 9% chance of sustained local transmission. If an epidemic is indeed underway, then our model predicts a delay of 7.5 (95% CI 3.9-16.3) weeks between the first reported case and the total number of COVID-19 exceeding 1,000; by the time the tenth case has been reported this lead time shrinks to 4.4 (95% CI 2.1-11.4) weeks (see Supplementary Appendix).
Given the speed and stealth with which COVID-19 spreads 4 , the entire map will likely be fully red within a week or two. Proactive social distancing can block community transmission, avert catastrophic surges in hospitalizations, and save lives 5 . For those still weighing if, when, and how aggressively to act, there is little time for delay.
