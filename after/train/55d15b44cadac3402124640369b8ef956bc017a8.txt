This study explored the equivalency of patient-collected tongue, anterior nares 28 (nasal), and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to health care worker-collected NP samples for 29 detecting SARS-CoV-2.

The use of personal protective equipment 57 (PPE) by health care workers obtaining testing samples is critical to reduce transmission, but 58 there are shortages of such equipment in many hospitals 8 .
For other virus-mediated upper respiratory infections, such as influenza, viral material can be 60 detected from swabs of the lower nares and mid-turbinate region 9,10,11 . Experience with 61 respiratory pathogens such as tuberculosis have also shown that samples obtained from tongue- 
Health care workers used a spoken script to explain the study and give eligible patients the 84 opportunity to decline. Any patient who had all four samples collected is considered as having 85 willingly participated in the study as they allowed the sample collection and the use of the data 86 produced from the sample. This study protocol was deemed to be an operational project by the 87 Office of Human Research Affairs at UnitedHealth Group.
Participants were provided instructions and asked to self-collect tongue, nasal, and MT samples, The study was powered to a one-sided, one-sample test of proportions with a continuity 112 correction to determine whether the percentage of patients with a positive result on the NP test 113 that were also positive for a patient-collected test was significantly greater than 90%, assuming 114 .
