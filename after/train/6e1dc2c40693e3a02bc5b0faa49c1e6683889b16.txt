The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a serious threat to 25 global public health, and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society. The 26 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause 27 severe respiratory illness and death. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs 28 that can treat COVID-19. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively 29 developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the 30 highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely 31 considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an 32 effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In 33 this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples 34 collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-35 specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly 36 correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to 37 determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B 38 cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain 39 (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-40 CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were 41 tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. We detected 42 epitope-specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-neutralising activity in the immunised 43 mice. This study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of 44 vaccines against COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by 48 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in 49 December 2019 and has since become a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 infections 50 have so far led to over 2 million cases and more than 0.13 million deaths across more Although a putative epitope that binds to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been 76 reported 15 , more epitopes with high affinity need to be identified. Information on 77 these epitopes would be useful, particularly in regard to human immunological bias 78 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This phenomenon has restricted the development 82 of effective vaccines for influenza A and other highly variable viruses [17] [18] [19] . All the 83 methods used to overcome or manipulate these viral immunity restrictions rely on the 84 landscape of immunodominance. It is therefore crucial to map the immunogenicity 85 landscape of the potential epitopes of the S protein to accelerate the development of identified five linear immunodominant (ID) sites in the S protein that did not induce 92 neutralising antibodies. On the contrary, the RBD was found to contain the major 93 neutralising epitopes in the S protein, but did not have any ID sites 21 .
In this study, we aimed to map the landscape of ID sites within the S protein of 95 SARS-CoV-2 and compare these results with those of its counterpart in SARS-CoV.
Unlike SARS-CoV, we found the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 had linear ID sites in sera 97 samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. Subsequent 98 microneutralisation tests demonstrated that mice immunised with peptides containing 99 the ID sites within RBD produced neutralising antibodies. Taken together, the RBD of 100 SARS-CoV-2 has a different ID landscape to its counterpart in SARS-CoV.
Furthermore, these data can provide guidance on the design of S protein-based SARS-
CoV-2 vaccines that might avoid adverse reactions or disease-enhancing effects. 103 104 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Immune responses and antiviral effects in serum from COVID-19 patients 174 All serum samples from COVID-19 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by 175 ELISA assay using plates coated by SARS-CoV-2 lysates ( Figure 1A ). The profiles of 176 IgG, and IgM, and IgA against S (spike) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins showed that 177 not all patients had elevated antibody titres compared to healthy donors ( Figure 1B -G).
Generally, high IgG titres against both S and N proteins were present in the sera, as secondary infections that need to be considered. 284 We also analysed the correlation between S or N protein-specific antibody levels and tested if the ID sites in the RBD fragment could be used as potential vaccines in mice. 298 We found that epitopes/protein-specific antibody titres exceeded the 299 microneutralisation titres by several orders of magnitude. Considering the relatively 300 low neutralising antibody levels in the recovered patients in this study and in a 301 previous report 26 , it is reasonable to expect significant differences between specific 302 antibodies and neutralising antibodies. We found there was equivalent antiviral 303 activity from immunisation with epitopes compared to immunisation with the entire 304 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This provides evidence that epitope-based vaccines could 305 offer comparable protection compared to subunit vaccines, but with the potentially 306 better safety. 307 We also compared binding residues of previously identified SARS-CoV-2 308 neutralising antibodies with ID epitopes. The ID sites in the RBD were found to be histopathological changes 30 . Even so, these results provide limited information on ID. 318 We still do not know how to effectively target immunodominance, and we still need 319 to understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Immunized Control (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
