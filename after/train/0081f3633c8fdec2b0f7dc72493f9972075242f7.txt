Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a neuroinvasive virus that has been used as a model organism 23
for studying common properties of all herpesviruses. HSV induces host organelle 24 rearrangement and forms dispersed assembly compartments in epithelial cells, which 25 complicates the study of HSV assembly. In this study, we show that HSV forms a visually 26 distinct unitary cytoplasmic viral assembly center (cVAC) in both cancerous and primary 27 neuronal cells that concentrates viral structural proteins and is the site of capsid envelopment. 28
The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such 29
as Golgi-and recycling endosome-derived membranes. Lastly, we show that HSV cVAC 30 formation and/or maintenance depends on an intact microtubule network and a viral tegument 31 protein, pUL51. Our observations suggest that the neuronal cVAC is a uniquely useful model to 32 study common herpesvirus assembly pathways, and cell-specific pathways for membrane 33 reorganization. 34 35 was not certified by peer review)
cells. During studies of the function of the HSV-1 pUL51 tegument protein we observed cell-117 type-specific localization patterns for pUL51 and, most interestingly, organization into a unitary 118 structure that might correspond to a cVAC in cells of the mouse neuronal CAD cell line. To 119 determine whether this pUL51-containing structure in CAD cells might be a cVAC, we tested the 120 localization of other viral structural proteins. CAD cells were infected with HSV-1(F) at high 121 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) and co-stained for various tegument and glycoproteins. As shown 122 in Figure 1A , we observed a unitary perinuclear cluster of viral proteins in most cells (Figure 1C ) 123 in which at least six viral structural proteins including pUL11, pUL16, pUL51, gD, gE, and gL 124 were concentrated, suggesting the viral protein cluster might be a cVAC. Note that for these 125 viral proteins, not all of them localize to the putative cVAC at the same efficiency, for example, 126 pUL51 almost exclusively concentrate to the cluster, while most of the gD localizes to the 127 cytoplasmic space or cell membrane. To determine whether a similar structure forms in 128 neuronal cells of human origin, we tested in the same way for formation of the putative cVAC in 129 SH-SY5Y cells, a human cancerous neuronal cell line ( Figure 1B ). As expected, a similar 130 putative cVAC is observed in most cells, albeit at a lower frequency ( Figure 1C ). In addition, 131 unlike in CAD cells, where the putative cVAC is composed of numerous small viral protein 132 puncta ( Figure 1A) , the viral protein cluster in SH-SY5Y cells typically appeared as a collection 133 of several large granules ( Figure 1B) . Together, the localization pattern of viral proteins in both 134 CAD and SH-SY5Y cells is different from it in cells of epithelial origin, such as Vero cells (Figure 135 1D), suggesting that the mode of viral component trafficking is cell context-dependent. 136
To examine whether the formation of the putative cVAC is a specific property of HSV-1, we 137 infected CAD cells with an HSV-2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived virus (Figure 138 1E). As expected, a cluster of viral proteins was observed in infected cells, although pUL11 and 139 gD did not completely colocalize with each other within the cluster ( Figure 1E ). 140
To characterize the temporal dynamics of the HSV-1 putative cVAC, CAD and SH-SY5Y cell 141 were subjected to synchronized infection and fixed at various time points after infection. As 142 shown in Figure 1F , the putative cVAC was formed as early as 4 hour-post-infection (h.p.i) and 143 was maintained as late as 15 h.p.i, and its gross morphology showed no obvious change 144 despite the progression of the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by the infection. Further time 145
points are not shown due to severe cytoplasmic space shrinkage associated with cell rounding. 146
The stability of the putative cVAC suggests that it is not an intermediate stage of CPE 147 progression. 148
Immortalized cell lines often differ from their primary counterparts in many ways. To determine 149 whether formation of a putative cVAC is a peculiarity of immortalized neuronal cells, primary 150 mouse cortical neurons were tested. Cortical neurons from newborn mouse pups were 151 harvested as described in Material and Methods and allowed to differentiate in vitro for 3 days 152 on a layer of primary mouse astrocyte feeder cells. The mixed culture was then infected with 153 HSV-1(F) and fixed 12 h.p.i before being subjected to immunofluorescent microscopy. 154
Interestingly, a putative cVAC was formed in cells that were stained positive for neuron marker 155 MAP2 (Figure 2 , B and C, white arrows), while in astrocytes, viral proteins form dispersed 156 puncta that resemble the viral protein distribution in epithelial cells (Figure 2C , cyan arrow). 157
These results suggest that the formation of a putative cVAC is a property of both primary and 158 immortalized neuronal cells, and may be specific for cells of the neuronal lineage. 159
The viral protein cluster is the site of capsid envelopment. It is well-established that HCMV 160 forms a cVAC in infected cell. The HCMV viral protein cluster is formed around the MTOC 161 (Sanchez et al., 2000) and is the site of capsid envelopment (Gilloteaux and Nassiri, 2000) . For 162 most cell types, the MTOC is formed around centrosome, which can be defined by staining for a 163 centrosome-specific microtubule protein γ-tubulin (Sanchez and Feldman, 2017) . To test the 164 hypothesis that the cluster of viral proteins that were observed in HSV-infected neuronal cells is 165 an HCMV cVAC-like viral assembly compartment, the distribution of viral capsids in relationship 166
to the viral protein cluster and centrosome was investigated. First, CAD cells were infected with 167 a recombinant BAC-derived HSV-1 in which the minor capsid protein pUL35 (VP26) was fused 168 with a red fluorescent protein (RFP), and then the localizations of cytoplasmic capsids, viral 169 tegument protein pUL11, and γ-tubulin were determined. As shown in Figure 3A , most 170 cytoplasmic capsids were concentrated within the "clouds" of pUL11 staining, which surrounded 171 the centrosome, suggesting that the viral protein cluster (putative cVAC) is a viral assembly 172
To confirm that capsid envelopment occurs within a unitary structure in CAD cells, transmission 174 electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on infected CAD cells. Whenever more than ten 175 capsids were observed in a microscopy section, most of them were concentrated at one single 176 perinuclear compartment in the cells, in which various stages of enveloping capsids can be 177 identified ( Figure 3B ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that HSV forms a cVAC at 178 which capsids are enveloped in infected neurons. 179 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The double-membrane nature 180 of some structures that were observed in TEM ( Figure 3B ), suggested the possibility that the 181 putative cVAC might instead be an autophagic compartment, as autophagy is a major 182 mechanism of anti-viral response in neuronal cells (Orvedahl et al., 2007) . Autophagy leads to 183 the formation of a double-membrane structure called autophagosome, which engulfs cellular 184 components and intracellular pathogens within itself before fusing with lysosomes for 185 degradation (Tanida, 2011, Parzych and Klionsky, 2014) . In mammalian cells, the membranes 186 that form an autophagosome are defined by the incorporation of an autophagy marker LC3 187 to membranes, forming puncta structures ( Figure 4C ). Upon infection, these GFP-LC3 puncta 192
do not appear to concentrate to any subcellular compartment or co-localize with viral tegument 193 protein pUL11 or viral glycoprotein gD, suggesting that the HSV putative cVAC is not a 194 canonical autophagosome. 195
When overexpressed in cells, misfolded proteins can concentrate around the centrosome in a 196 microtubule-dependent manner, which forms a protein aggregation termed the aggresome, with 197 lysosomes concentrated on the outer rim (Johnston et al., 1998) . To examine whether the HSV 198 putative cVAC is instead an aggresome-like degradation compartment, LAMP1, a lysosome 199 marker, was stained in infected SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Figure 4F , the majority of infected 200 cells has reduced LAMP1 positive structures at 12 h.p.i, and viral tegument protein pUL11 does 201 not particularly co-localize or form organized spatial structures with LAMP1 puncta, suggesting 202 that HSV putative cVAC is a bona fide viral assembly site. Interestingly, we also noticed that a 203 minor population of infected cells have shown distinct LAMP1 localization patterns:(i) pUL11 204 puncta rimming around one large intense LAMP1 aggregate (Figure 4G) , and (ii) co-localization 205 between pUL11 and LAMP1 ( Figure 4H ). To examine whether these two patterns represent 206 intermediate stages of HSV cVAC formation, infected SH-SY5Y cells were fixed at various time 207 points, co-stained for pUL11 and LAMP1, and counted for the number of cells exhibiting each 208 distinct pattern. The proportion of cells that showed no association between pUL11 and LAMP1 209 increased with time, while those that showed either of the two patterns of association decreased 210 as infection progressed (Figure 4I ), suggesting that association of the cVAC with LAMP1 211 represents early stages of lysosome morphology alteration by HSV infection. 212 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To elucidate the spatial relationship of Golgi-218 derived membrane and the HSV cVAC in neuronal cells, infected CAD and SH-SY5Y cells were 219 co-stained for Golgi membrane markers GM130 (cis-Golgi) or Golgin97 (trans-Golgi) along with 220 viral tegument protein pUL51. As shown in Figure 5 , membranes positive for GM130 221 concentrate at the same place as pUL51 in infected cells. Interestingly, in SH-SY5Y cells, 222 GM130 positive membranes were observed to form a tubular structure partially or completely 223
surrounding, but not coinciding with pUL51 staining. 224
In infected SH-SY5Y cell, Golgin97 positive membranes also concentrated at the same 225 subcellular compartment as the HSV cVAC, however, individual Golgin97 puncta did not co-226 localize with pUL51 puncta ( Figure 5F ). This is consistent with our observation of infected Vero 227 cells, in which pUL51 and Golgi membranes localized in adjacent to each other at multiple 228 dispersed foci ( Figure 5G , white arrowheads), further supporting the hypothesis that the HSV 229 cVAC is where viral assembly occurs. 230
To further compare the similarity between the HSV cVAC and the HCMV cVAC, a fluorescent 231 protein fused with an ER-localizing signal (Denecke et al., 1992 ) was expressed in CAD or SH-232 SY5Y cells to mark ER membranes before the infection.

To characterize 246 the dynamics of Rab5 and Rab11 in infected neuronal cells, uninfected or infected SH-SY5Y 247 and CAD cells were fixed and co-stained with the antibody against gE in combination with the 248 antibody against Rab5 or Rab11 ( Figure 6 ). In uninfected CAD and SH-SY5Y cells, both Rab5 249
and Rab11 concentrate to one perinuclear region (Figure 6 Figure 6F ). Interestingly, in CAD cells, whose larger cytoplasmic space allowed clearer 266 identification of individual puncta signals, Rab5 puncta co-localized with gE puncta that were not 267 part of the cVAC ( Figure 6C , white arrowhead). 268
Since Rab11 was actively transported to the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner in 269 uninfected cells (Figure 6 Microtubule filament is essential for the maintenance of HSV cVAC.

Since it is well-established 279 that cVAC formation in HCMV infected cells is microtubule-and dynein motor-dependent 280 suggesting that HSV cVAC formation is microtubule-dependent. 289
Nocodazole causes cell type-specific growth defect. Since nocodazole profoundly disrupts 290 HSV cVAC formation, its net consequence, namely viral production, was investigated by single-291 step growth (SSG) assays. As shown in Figure 8A , viral progeny production was reduced in SH-292 SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner that proportionally correlates with the reduction in 293 cVAC formation, but the same effect was not observed in CAD cells. This trend remained 294 unchanged as late as 24 h.p.i ( Figure 8B ).These results suggest that nocodazole treatment is 295 unable to change certain aspects of the HSV assembly compartment in CAD cells even if this 296 compartment is no longer concentrated at one single region in the cell. Thus, we hypothesized 297 that in nocodazole treated CAD cells, HSV assembly compartment is still able to form as 298 individual periphery sites, similar to it in epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, nocodazole-299 treated HSV-infected CAD and SH-SY5Y cells were stained for viral protein pUL51 and gE. As 200μM of ciliobrevin D, which was the highest concentration tested, dispersal of Rab11 puncta 308 was only observed in CAD cells ( Figure 9A ). To test whether ciliobrevin D disrupts cVAC 309 formation, CAD cells were synchronously infected with HSV-(F) and treated with ciliobrevin D at 310 3 h.p.i before staining for pUL11 and -tubulin.

Also, the 345 N-terminus of pUL71 forms a tyrosine-based retrieval motif (Yxxφ), which upon mutation results 346 in the accumulation of pUL71 on the cytoplasmic membrane, in addition to viral assembly defect 347 (Dietz et al., 2018) . The HSV tegument protein pUL51, a homolog of HCMV pUL71, has a 348 conserved N-terminal Yxxφ motif at residue 19-22 (Roller et al., 2014) . Based on these, we 349 hypothesize that the conserved retrieval motif in pUL51 is also essential for the maintenance of 350 HSV cVAC. To test this hypothesis, CAD and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with a mutant HSV 351 of which tyrosine reside in the hypothetical Yxxφ motif was replaced with an alanine 352 (pUL51Y19A). As shown in Figure 10F , cVAC no longer formed in the HSV mutant infected cells. 353
In addition, pUL51 no longer efficiently co-localized with glycoprotein gE (Figure 10 , G and H), 354
suggesting that not only the concentrated HSV cVAC, but also periphery assembly sites were 355 disrupted by the pUL51Y19A mutation. Unsurprisingly, the pUL51Y19A mutation also causes viral 356 growth defect in both CAD and SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 10 , I and J), which is consistent with our 357 hypotheses that (i) viral assembly sites formation is important for efficient viral production, and 358

If so, 393
concentration of viral proteins would be accompanied by recruitment of markers of 394 autophagosomes or lysosomes. However, the autophagy marker LC3 does not concentrate to 395 the cVAC (Figure 4 ), suggesting these membranes are not canonical autophagosomes. Also, 396 the lysosomal marker LAMP1 does not co-localize with viral protein puncta (Figure 4) , 397
suggesting the cVAC is not a degradation compartment that involves lysosome. Combining 398 these two observations with the stability of the cVAC throughout the infection ( Figure 1F ), we 399 conclude that the cVAC is not a canonical degradation compartment.

The requirement for cytoskeleton components is also similar between HCMV and HSV. In cells 529 infected with either virus, nocodazole is able to disrupt cVAC morphology (Indran et al., 530 2010) (Figure 7, 8) , suggesting that utilization of the microtubule network is a conserved 531 mechanism for herpesvirus assembly. Also, sensitivity of the HSV cVAC to ciliobrevin D 532
suggests that dynein motors are important for cVAC maintenance (Figure 9 ), as discussed 533 above, however the potential off-target effect of the dynein ATPase inhibitor cannot be 534 We hypothesize that homologous viral proteins might also function similarly in cells infected with 542 HCMV and HSV. pUL71 of HCMV, which is a homolog of HSV pUL51, was shown to be 543 important for viral cytoplasmic envelopment and proper cVAC morphology (Schauflinger et al., 544 2011) . Reciprocally, in this study, we have shown that pUL51 in HSV is also important for cVAC 545 maintenance, as mutations in HSV pUL51 disrupts cVAC formation ( Figure 10F ). Interestingly, 546 although the hypothetical tyrosine-based trafficking motif in the N-terminus of pUL51 is 547 conserved in several herpesviruses and has been shown to be a cytoplasmic retrieval motif in 548 HCMV homolog pUL71 (Dietz et al., 2018) , it is as yet unclear whether the same holds true for 549 HSV. It is possible that the tyrosine residue at position 19 in pUL51 is indeed a trafficking motif, 550 which upon mutation prevents pUL51 from concentrating to the HSV cVAC and, in turns, causes 551 failure in cVAC formation.
