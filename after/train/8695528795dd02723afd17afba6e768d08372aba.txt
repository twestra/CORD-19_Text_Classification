Severe COVID-19 patients account for most of the mortality of this disease. 25 Early detection and effective treatment of severe patients remain major 26 challenges. Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera 27 from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine 28 learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a 29 training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model correctly 30 classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further 31 validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly 32 classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients 33 implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and 34 complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This 35 study shows that it is possible to predict progression to severe COVID-19 36 disease using serum protein and metabolite biomarkers. Our data also 37 uncovered molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 with potential for 38 developing anti-viral therapies.

Identification of severe patients using machine learning 107 We next investigated the possibility of classify the severe COVID-19 108 patients based on the molecular signatures of proteins and metabolites (Table   109 S2). We built a random forest machine learning model based on proteomic the reason of incorrectly classified is unclear. 117 We then tested the model on an independent cohort of ten patients 118 ( Figure 2E , Table S3 ). All severe patients were correctly identified, except one previously been reported in COVID-19 (Liang et al., 2020) . SAA1 was 206 reported to be elevated in severe SARS patients, but was not specific to 207 SARC-CoV (Pang et al., 2006) . As a major contributor to acute phase 208 response, complement system plays a crucial role in eliminating invading 209 pathogens in the early stage of infection. Among those APPs, two proteins 210 belong to the complement membrane attack complex, including complement 6
We also observed an accumulation of mannose and its derivatives in 215 severe patients. In the complement system, binding of mannose to lectin 216 leads to cleaveage of C2 and C4, which then form a C3 convertase to 217 promote complement activation (Ricklin et al., 2010) .
Suppressed platelet degranulation in severe sera 220 Fifteen of 17 proteins involved in platelet degranulation were down-221 regulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which may be associated with 222 observed thrombocytopenia in this patient cohort (Zheng et al., 2020) . Low 223 platelet count is also reported to be associated with severe COVID-19 and 2.07-fold (p = 1.86e-04) and 3.31-fold (p = 9.07e-07), respectively. 240 We also detected low levels of fatty acids such as arachidonate and the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Two of them could be explained by the 302 patients' complex comorbidity and medication history. The relatively small 303 sample size necessitates future validation studies in independent cohorts. 306 Our data shed light on the molecular changes reflected in COVID-19 sera 307 which could potentially yield critical diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets 308 for managing severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5 ).
