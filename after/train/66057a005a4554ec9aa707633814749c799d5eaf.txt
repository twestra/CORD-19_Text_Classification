Background: Glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of various pulmonary inflammatory diseases, but they are also often accompanied by significant adverse reactions. Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited.
We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies.
Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I²=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I²=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I²=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption All rights reserved.

(WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I²=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients SARS and MERS) .
Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.
Keywords: COVID-19; glucocorticoids; meta-analysis;
There are conflicting opinions about the use of glucocorticoids to treat patients with It is suggested that current clinical evidence does not support the use of glucocorticoids, which may cause several side effects (8) (9) . However, clinicians who are on the front line of the epidemic have proposed that short-term glucocorticoid therapy with small or medium dose could be beneficial for patients with severe conditions (10) . The current guidelines on COVID-19 are also inconsistent about the use of glucocorticoids. Some guidelines suggested trying short-term therapy with medium or small doses of glucocorticoids for patients with rapid or severe disease progression, but according to the WHO guidelines glucocorticoids should only be used under clinical trial conditions (11) (12) (13) . Effective evidence related to glucocorticoids to treat COVID-19 is still lacking.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically retrieve and summarize the current evidence of the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid therapy for patients with COVID-19, aiming to provide the best decision-making basis for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Extracted data included 1) basic information: first author, publication year, and the type of study design; 2) participants: disease, severity of disease, age distribution, and total number of patients; 3) details of the intervention and control groups: type, dosage and treatment course of glucocorticoid therapy; and 4) outcomes: for dichotomous data, we abstracted the number of events and total number of patients per group; and for continuous data, we abstracted the means, standard deviations (SD), and the total number of patients per group. For data that were missing or reported in unusable way, we reported the findings descriptively.
Two researchers (S Lu and S Zhao) independently assessed the potential bias in each included study, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion or consulting a third researcher (Q Shi). We assessed the risk of bias in RCTs using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (17) , which consists of seven domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias.
Each domain was graded as "Low", "Unclear", or "High". For cohort studies, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (18) , which contains eight domains:

We produced a "Summary of Findings" table using the GRADEpro software. The quality of evidence can be downgraded based on five factors (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) and upgraded based on three factors (large magnitude of effect, dose-response relation and plausible confounders or biases) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . The quality of evidence of each outcome is then classified as "high", "moderate", "low" or "very low".

As COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern and the situation is evolving rapidly, our study was not registered in order to speed up the process.
The rapid review identified 2509 publications, of which 23 studies (one RCT and 22 cohort studies) (29-51) met our inclusion criteria and were included. The literature screening process is shown in Figure 1 . One study included adult patients with severe MERS, 17 studies included patients with SARS, and the remaining five studies were on patients with COVID-19 (Table 1) . Due to the insufficient representativeness and follow-up time, only three articles scored higher than six out of nine points. The methodological quality of included cohort studies was poor. The risk of bias of included RCT was unclear because of unclear risks of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias ( Table 2, Table 3 ).

Heterogeneity among studies on SARS assessing mortality was significant (I²=84.6%).
Heterogeneity in studies of mortality in SARS patients was reduced to 67.4% in the subgroup analysis of severe cases, and to 68.7% in the subgroup analysis of adults. Therefore, disease severity and age are probably the main sources of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of mortality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the on the SARS mortality by omitting one study at a time. Two studies had a significant impact on the results of the meta-analysis (34, 35) ( Figure 11 ). The dosing of glucocorticoids was different in the study by Yam et al than in other studies, so the high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis on mortality may be at least partly caused by the different dosing (34).
We assessed publication bias was for the eight studies on SARS mortality. The Egger regression test showed that publication bias was unlikely (P=0.619) (Figure 12 ).
Our study identified direct evidence on the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy for five difference outcomes in adults with COVID-19.

In addition, glucocorticoid therapy may even prolong the duration of hospitalization. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as infections and osteonecrosis. We found moderate-quality evidence that in patients with mild SARS glucocorticoids may be associated with a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.
Systemic glucocorticoids are highly effective anti-inflammatory drugs, but their use against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains controversial. A case series of children with COVID-19 in Hubei reported that systematic glucocorticoids (dose 2 mg/kg) were given to both two included critical cases in combination with invasive mechanical ventilation and intravenous immunoglobulin. In both children, the symptoms on admission were alleviated, although in one of them only partly (52). A recent cohort study from JAMA Internal Medicine reported that among COVID-19 patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (39). Our results are compared with published systematic reviews of glucocorticoid therapy for severe pneumonia. A recent rapid review of COVID-19 treatment showed controversial evidence on the use of corticosteroids, and could not give any suggestion on the use of corticosteroids due to the lack of quantitative synthesis (53). A systematic review covering in vitro studies on SARS, SARS in humans and other diseases such as ARDS, found that 25 of the 29 included studies were inconclusive, and the remaining four found glucocorticoids harmful (54).

A meta-analysis of SARS in 2017 showed that the incidence of osteonecrosis increased with the dosing of systemic glucocorticoids, and the summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% CI 1.30-1.89) (56). As retrospective studies have shown that the glucocorticoids were given for 19% to 26% of patients with COVID-19 (and to 45% of patients with severe disease), there is a high risk that this therapy is currently misused (57-59). In summary, the current research evidence does not support the routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19. Because COVID-19 tends to be less severe in children than in adults (60), the use of systemic glucocorticoids should in particular not be recommended in children.
This is to our knowledge the first comprehensive and systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid therapy for patients with COVID-19 using data from the COVID-19 studies, and can be considered at the moment as the best evidence for decision-making on this topic. We conducted meta-analyses to quantitatively synthesize the findings of the included studies and objectively evaluate the current research evidence. Our study had also several limitations. We found only limited direct evidence of systemic glucocorticoids therapy for COVID-19, and had to use indirect evidence from the SARS and MERS epidemics.

In conclusion, glucocorticoid therapy may increase the risk of death in patients with coronavirus infections who have mild symptoms. We found no association between glucocorticoids and mortality in patients with severe symptoms. In the context of clinical trials, low dose systemic glucocorticoid therapy for a short duration may be acceptable.
