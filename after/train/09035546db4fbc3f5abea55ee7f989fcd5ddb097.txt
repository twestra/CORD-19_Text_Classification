25 Objectives 26 The current form of severe acute respiratory syndrome called coronavirus disease 2019 27 (COVID-19) caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a major global health problem. The 28 aim of our study was to use the official epidemiological data and predict the possible outcomes 29 of the COVID-19 pandemic using artificial intelligence (AI)-based RNNs (Recurrent Neural 30 Networks), then compare and validate the predicted and observed data. 31 Materials and Methods 32 We used the publicly available datasets of World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins 33 University to create the training dataset, then have used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with 34 gated recurring units (Long Short-Term Memory -LSTM units) to create 2 Prediction Models. 35 Information collected in the first t time-steps were aggregated with a fully connected (dense) 36 neural network layer and a consequent regression output layer to determine the next predicted 37 value. We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and 38 observed data, then recalculated the predictions again.

WHO with R0 suggested to range between 1.4 and 2.5. More recent analyzes have indicated 109 higher R0 values around 3 (with the mean and median R0 for published estimates being 3.28 110 and 2.79, respectively). 11,15 111 The daily number of the newly diagnosed infections -epidemic curves 112 The initial epidemic curves of the COVID-19 outbreak from Hubei, China showed a mixed 113 pattern, indicating that early cases were likely from a continuous common source e.g. from 114 several zoonotic events in Wuhan, followed by secondary and tertiary transmission providing There are different mathematical models that may demonstrate and predict the dynamics of the 134 different infectious diseases. 18 These models, used to simulate the dynamics of infectious 135 diseases, may be based on statistical, mathematical, empirical or machine learning methods. 19 
The first attempts to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine were made in the 1970s.
Initially AI was used to implement programs to help clinical decision making, but to date its 138 use is gaining more and more widespread acceptance in biomedical sciences. 20
One class of AI, a form of artificial neural networks, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 140 with Long short-term memory (LSTM) were previously used to model and forecast the 141 influenza epidemic, with strong competitiveness and reliable results. 21, 22, 23
The aim of the current study was to use the available official data as a training dataset, followed 143 by predicting the possible outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic using AI-based RNNs, then 144 compare the predictions with the observed data. in China were from Hubei province, only data from that province was included. For each 154 country, the date of the first infection was set as day 1 for the disease time scale. (Fig 1) 155 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This 159 was important to avoid distortion of the propagated epidemic curves. In Belgium, for example, 160 the first illness occurred on 04/02/2020 and there was no further case reported for up to 26 days.
The next illness occurred on 01/03/2020. Inclusion of the early case from February would 162 contribute to a false learning rule for the AI, hence corrupting the results.

The training data set was obtained by averaging the daily incidence rates per 100 000 176 inhabitants across the 17 countries included, for each day in the time series.

The resulting daily new morbidity data are labeled "Old Prediction 236 1" and "Old Prediction 2" on each graph. We then expanded our factual data set with new daily 237 data available until 10/04/2020. These new factual data are labeled "Observed next days" on 238 the graphs. Thus, except for Hungary, we have 11 new daily factual data elements for all 239 countries examined. In the case of Hungary, the data of 10/04/2020 were already available, so 240 in this case 12 new factual data elements are included. Using these data, we validated the two 241 predictions of our model.
The amount of root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) was used for validation.
In our analysis the possible bias regarding the difference ratios between the observed and 244 predicted values are interpreted using root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE). 245 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

As the next step, using the next 11 new observation data elements after the first prediction and 257 12 in the case of Hungary, we modified the predictions using both methods. These modified 258 prediction data are labeled New Prediction 1 and New Prediction 2, respectively.
The following section shows the outcomes for Prediction 1 and Prediction 2 for the individual 261 country level data (Figs 4-10) .

Albeit suppression and mitigation measures can reduce the incidence of infection, COVID-19 302 disease, given its relatively high transmissibility reflected by average R0 values of 3.28, will 303 continue to spread, most likely. 14 Accordingly, public health measures must be implemented as 304 the incubation period of the virus may be long (1-14 days, but there are some opinions, that this 305 can be 21 days), during which time asymptomatic or presymptomatic spreading may ensue.
Moreover currently it is uncertain, whether those, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 data regarding diagnostic tests performed per country, or death rates were omitted, given they Summarizing, the COVID-19 disease is a global health challenge, which caused the WHO to 343 declare a "public health emergency of international concern on 30/01/2020". 16 The influence of 344 this global epidemic has dug deep into the day-to-day conduct of everyone, with unforeseen 345 challenges still pending for governments and policymakers. Starting from this, everyone, 346 especially decision makers must be aware, that the current situation might be just the beginning, The results of our study underscore that the COVID-19 pandemic is probably a propagated 351 source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks of the rise of the daily number of newly diagnosed 352 infections are to be anticipated.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to model the predicted evolution of the 354 pandemic using data from official databases with the help of the AI-based RNNs trained on the 355 currently available data regarding the spread of the disease and validated with comparison of 356 the predicted and observed data. Most studies to date expect a single peak on the epidemic 357 curve, but some fear the emergence of future peaks when mitigation-suppression measures will 358 be discontinued. According to our models, this can even happen, if the strict measures are 359 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
