Background: Italy and especially the Lombardy region is experiencing a heavy burden of Covid-19 infection. The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy. Methods. In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection -both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. h  a  s  n  o  t  y  e  t  b  e  e  n  r  e  a  c  h  e  d  .

The method is based on non-linear least square framewo for intrinsic growth estimation , in order to obtain with M the Laplace transforming probability distribution of the serial interval of the infection. The estimation is obtained with 100 susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at the early stage in Wuhan as reported in [7] .

Suspects correspond to the number of individuals screened with test which have been confirmed. Figure 3 and Table 1 show the  estimated values, computed on a daily basis for the Italian regions a for the initial outbreak region Lombardy, where about 40 cases were confirmed out of 100 suspec ( Figure 4 ).The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponent fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series.

We used the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model [4] to simulate epidemic since was established on January 2020. It is based on a previous model SIR which was based on thr compartments, but since the infection has an incubation period, the compartment E (Exposed) is include This compartments are modeled over the time, and capture the changes in the population. Let us say th given N the total population, then N=S+E+I+R, where:
-"S" Susceptible is the portion of population that does not have any vax coverage or immune;
-"E" exposed: is the portion of the population that have been infected, but are in the incubation period that do not infect others;
-"I" Infectious: is the portion of N that is infectious and may infect others, they become dead or may recover; -"R" Recovered: number of infectious people who have been healed, and become immune. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
