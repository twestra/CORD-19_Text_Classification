10 11 SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that newly emerged in China in late 2019 1,2 and spread rapidly 12 worldwide, caused the first witnessed pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. As the pandemic 13 progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical 14 to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-15 CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or 16 aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper 17 respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-18 CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure 19 and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days 20 after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets 21 was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive 22
Current epidemiological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily via respiratory 47 droplets and contact 8-10,14,15 , which is used as the basis for mitigation of spread through physical and 48 social distancing measures. However, scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently 49 transmitted via the air is weak.
Previous studies have shown that ferrets were susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV 16-20 , and that 51 SARS-CoV was efficiently transmitted to co-housed ferrets via direct contact 16 . Here, we used a 52 ferret transmission model to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 spreads through direct contact and/or 53 through the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols). For this purpose, individually housed donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with a strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a German 55 traveller returning from China. Six hours post-inoculation (hpi), a direct contact ferret was added to 56 each of the cages. The next day, indirect recipient ferrets were placed in adjacent cages, separated 57 from the donor cages by two steel grids, 10 cm apart, allowing viruses to be transmitted only via the 58 air (Supplementary Figure 1) . On alternating days to prevent cross-contamination, throat, nasal and 59 rectal swabs were collected from each ferret in the inoculated and direct contact groups and from 60 the indirect recipient group, followed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR and virus titration. Table 1) .
In contrast, no infectious virus was isolated from the rectal swabs. Infectious virus titers ranged from 91 10 0,75 to 10 2,75 TCID 50 /ml (median tissue culture infectious dose per ml) in the donor ferrets, from 92 10 0,75 to 10 3,5 TCID 50 /ml in the direct contact ferrets and from 10 0,75 to 10 4,25 TCID 50 /ml in the indirect 93 recipient ferrets. All SARS-CoV-2 positive ferrets seroconverted 21 dpi/dpe, and the antibody levels 
After the last wash, a 10 μl multi-channel pipet was used to remove residual ethanol. Plates were 280 air-dried for 6 min at room temperature. Plates were removed from the magnetic block and 30 μl of 281 PCR grade water was added to each well and mixed by pipetting up and down 10 times. Plates were 282 incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then placed back on the magnetic block for 2 min to 283 allow separation of the beads. Supernatants were pipetted in a new plate and RNA was kept at 4 o C.
The RNA was directly used for RT-qPCR using primers and probes targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 285 as previously described 30 . The primers and probe for PDV detection were described previously 29 .
