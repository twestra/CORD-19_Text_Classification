The response of pathophysiological research to emerging epidemics often occurs 26 after the epidemic and, as a consequence, has little to no impact on improving 27 patient outcomes or on developing high-quality evidence to inform clinical 28 management strategies during the epidemic. Rapid and informed guidance of 29 epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick 30 compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case 31 study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a 32 proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and 33 build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we 34 applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert 35 knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary 36 team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge 37 management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and 38 evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require 39 months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase 40 (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB 41 with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 42 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step 43 guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed 44 online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate 45 hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore 46 and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was 47 generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described 48
here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future 49 . : bioRxiv preprint 3 threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for 50 computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new 51 avenues for infectious disease research. 52 53 Availability: www.zikaknowledgebase.eu 54 55 Funding 56 European Commission's Seventh Framework Research Programme project 57 PREPARE (FP7-Health n°602525) and ZIKALLIANCE (MK, H2020; No 734548). 58 59 Author summary 60 During the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions 61 between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a 62 steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of 63 time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for 64 integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. 65 Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles 66 on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract 67 information about host-pathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and 68 organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined 69 cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and 70 information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological 71
knowledge as a potential tool to support investigations during an emergency. This 72 tool is contrasted with conventional approaches that would take months to comb 73 . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 4 through the massive amount of existing literature. In addition to providing 74 background information for research, scientific publications can be processed to 75 transform textual information into complex networks, which can be integrated with 76 existing knowledge resources to suggest novel hypotheses that potentially contribute 77 to innovative infectious disease research approaches. This study shows that the 78 knowledge extraction and mapping process required to inform clinical and research 79 responses to an emerging epidemic can be efficiently and effectively executed with a 80 dedicated and trained group of experts, a validated process and the necessary tools. 81
Our results further provide an overview of ZIKV biology, allow prediction of drug 82 efficacy and indentify specific host factors and signalling pathways affected by ZIKV. 83 84 85
The response to a (re-)emerging infectious disease (ID) epidemic requires a rapid 87 compilation of existing pathophysiological knowledge to inform research priorities 88 guiding basic and clinical research. Gaps in understanding of the underlying 89 mechanisms make it difficult to design effective disease-modifying therapies. Hence, 90
during an emerging ID outbreak, the available information at the time of its 91 emergence and the subsequent rapid accumulation of scientific knowledge from 92 various sources needs to be captured and analysed in a timely and comprehensive 93 fashion. Responding to an ID outbreak therefore would benefit from the use of a 94 knowledge repository that organizes the disease-related knowledge into pathway, 95 molecular interaction and disease maps. Such maps are a relatively new concept 96 that have been used in neurodegenerative and heart diseases (1,2), but which have 97 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

For knowledge representation we applied a 171 semantic network approach as described previously (16, 17) . Briefly, the abstract 172 concepts necessary to capture and represent essential ideas and physical objects 173 relevant to the domain of knowledge were defined. Based on input from clinical and 174 virology experts, the concepts required to represent existing pathophysiological 175 knowledge of infectious diseases were modelled with objects, such as "genes", 176 "strains", "is expressed in" or "interacts with". For the ZIKV KB, we focused on 177 concepts required to represent text-mining results and information from structured 178 databases of protein-protein (PPI) and drug-protein interactions, namely genes, 179 diseases, pathogens and drugs. Relationships between pathogens, genes, drugs 180 and compounds extracted by text-mining were represented by three types of 181 relations: up-regulation, down-regulation and regulation (for further details see S2 182 diseases. The defined semantic concepts become directly available in a natural-185 language-like query and reporting language. This language can be used to address 186 specific questions and to summarise and visualise available knowledge. For 187 example, the query "is a drug which interacts with is a protein from organism human 188 which is expressed by a gene which is associated with a organism Zika" retrieves the 189 number of drugs that interact with a protein of interest and generates a visualisation 190 which applies a color coding to genes that indicates to the number of associated 191 drugs. 192

Genes, diseases, pathogens and 207 drugs, can be used as subjects and as objects and the sum of all extracted 208 associations form an initial knowledge network. Genes, diseases, pathogens and 209 drugs were defined by dictionaries that we curated from public sources as described The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743 doi: bioRxiv preprint compounds and diseases (for instance "activates", "restricts", "targets"). To optimise 220 recall and specificity of the mining, we extended the dictionaries for viral names, 221 acronyms and interaction predicates as well as defined a black-list of acronyms 222 causing mostly false positives. The term "microcephaly" is a reusable scientific concept that participates not just in 230 one "Subject-Predicate-Object" construct detected, but in all such constructs 231 detected that mention " microcephaly". Supplementary information is associated with 232 the "microcephaly" object, including, for example, information from the Disease 233 ontology, and other integrated resources, such as Gene-Disease-Association data 234 (DisGeNET). This expandable set of relationships forms a large network of 235 knowledge that enables new knowledge to be inferred by "reasoning" based on the 236 logic encoded in those relationships. 237 238 Finally, the extracted relationships can be curated to manually optimise quality and 239 information content. A curation user interface was implemented to enable the expert 240 team to support or refute the automatically generated relationships. At least two 241 independent researchers (the "4-eye review mode") manually evaluated the 242 evidence for every extracted relationship. In the case that the evaluations from the 243 .

In addition, experts could expand the network with any relevant supporting evidence 247 from other integrated sources, such as public or proprietary databases and 248 experimental data. Semantic mapping describes the process of identifying and linking concepts that are 252 shared between two information sources. We integrated the databases listed in 253 Table 1 using existing concepts such as genes, pathogens or diseases which were 254 identified by ontological descriptors. Semantically identical objects are mapped to 255 descriptive data from literature and databases to allow informed and efficient 256
querying of the overall collected information (e.g. "Dengue disease" is mapped to the 257 following synonyms: "Breakbone fever", "Dengue disorder", "Dengue fever" and 258 "Dengue") (25). To this end, mapping scripts are created to resolve a given input 259 data format and match the provided entity identifiers or ontology terms. Experimental 260 data from key publications is mapped by the same approach. While these data are 261 henceforth available for search and reporting they are not yet displayed as part of 262 any specific molecular interaction and disease map.

Text mining results 296
We searched PubMed with the terms "Zika virus", "Dengue", "West Nile virus", 297 "Japanese encephalitis virus", "Tick-borne encephalitis virus", "Microcephaly" and 298 processing algorithm was applied to these sets of documents to efficiently extract the 308 fast growing information in the biomedical literature. The text mining extracted a total 309 of 11916 relationships, which were manually evaluated to 2982 verified relationships 310 (Table 2 ). The distribution of the curated relationships is depicted in Fig 3, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743 doi: bioRxiv preprint integrated from BioGRID and DrugBank, and 450431 gene-disease associations 327 from DisGeNET (Table 1) 
After an assessment period of internal use, a web-browser based user interface was 343 implemented to make the PREPARE ZIKA KB available to all ZIKV researchers. By 344 openly sharing the collected data and information, the ZIKA KB allows researchers to 345 generate hypotheses, identify knowledge gaps and interactively explore and interpret 346 data. All data are currently in the public domain. Upon request, data submission can 347 be modified to allow registered users to specify that submitted data should not be 348 publicly available 349 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743 doi: bioRxiv preprint . 350
In the following we provide several example use cases. For instance, publicly 352 available interaction data, such as the PPI and protein-drug interaction data can be 353 used to visualize drug targets and host factors involved in ZIKV pathogenesis. 354
Alternatively, users can filter for PPIs whose source or target is a drug or refine 355 search results to include only proteins localized to a specific cellular compartment, 356 such as the endoplasmic reticulum. The returned networks can be interrogated 357 subsequently to identify host factors that are targeted by the virus and to search for 358 drugs that interact with these host factors. and thus might contribute to drug 359 repositioning for future treatment options for ZIKV infection. The maps can also be 360 explored further by using integrated expression and knockout data. 361
To explore the integrated literature knowledge for relevance or obtain an overview of 362 drug targets or identify critical genes within the network consisting of gene-disease-363 pathogen relationships, predefined perspectives were overlaid onto the default map. 364
The association of ZIKV with microcephaly was reported most frequently across all 365 ZIKV literature and this association is visualized by the thickness of the edges (Fig  366   4A ). Known drug targets interacting directly with ZIKV or microcephaly were 367 highlighted in green for potential intervention evaluation (Fig 4B) . Genes playing a 368 role in ZIKV infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) were also highlighted 369 for comparative analyses of complementary experimental analyses (Fig 4C) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743 doi: bioRxiv preprint represents the corresponding primary manifestation of these viral infections. 387
Encephalitis is equally frequently associated with ZIKV and DENV confirming that 388 ZIKV is also an aetiological agent in encephalitis. these compounds provide a resource to study ZIKV pathogenesis and can contribute 405 to insights into the biology of ZIKV. To this end, the ZIKV molecular interaction and 406 disease map described in Figure 4 was extended and filtered to include these 407 potential "ZIKV effective drugs" which were connected to genes associated to ZIKV 408 through PPIs (Fig 6) . After this extension ten of the identified ZIKV effective drugs 409 were part of the new map which we then used to gain insight into potential drug 410 mechanisms and ZIKV biology. One of the drugs, Bortezomib, is a known antiviral 411 compound that inhibits replication of flaviviruses (32). Bortezomib is a proteasome 412 inhibitor, suggesting that proteasome action is essential for ZIKV replication. This genes whose expression is affected during ZIKV infection indicated that Sorafenib 534 likely acts via its target genes, FLT3 and/or BRAF, but not via its alternative target 535 genes VEGFR or PDGFR. In addition, the number of drugs to be screened was 536 reduced from 774 to 64 by filtering potential drug candidates based on their network 537 distance to ZIKV infection associated genes and additional phenotype relevant 538 additional knowledge, such as contained in the "FDA pregnancy" label. 539
The conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the initially low number of available 541 publications and limited experimental data, a situation which is inherent to most 542 emerging epidemics. Nevertheless, the work presented shows that the use of a 543
knowledge integrating system can provide guidance for clinical and research 544 responses, such as follow-up studies regarding the association between ZIKV, 545 .

These studies allow additional 550 comparative analyses between ZIKV and other flavivirus family members in terms of 551 virulence and pathogenic traits. 552
Another limitation of the system is the restricted types of information which can be 553 retrieved by text mining. While qualitative associations between genes/proteins, 554 drugs, diseases and organisms are readily amendable to automatic approaches, it is 555 currently almost impossible to extract, for example, clinical study designs, detailed 556 quantitative information or complex treatment plans. 557
Finally, the ZIKA KB in its current stage enables exploration of the integrated 558 information, as well as generation and curation of text-mining analysis but is not a 559 public tool for molecular interaction and disease map generation. The functions 560 required for these tasks will need further refinement before they can be made 561 available in a general way. 562
In summary, this approach in our opinion, provides a feasible way to collect and 564 integrate existing knowledge to better understand the molecular mechanisms of an 565 emerging pathogen. In addition our approach helps to identify gaps in knowledge 566
and, together with the other features, guides rapid and effective responses to future 567 epidemics. We have made the specific outcome of our approach, the Zika 568
