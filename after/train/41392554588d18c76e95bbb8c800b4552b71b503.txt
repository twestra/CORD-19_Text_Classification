A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy. A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.
The SARS-CoV-2, virus recently found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO), 1 has already spread through China from all continents (more than 168 countries), with 1,133,758 confirmed cases globally and 62,784 deaths (data as reported by Central European Time 5 April 2020). Due to the pandemic, the disease is not only affecting the health services, but also the economy in a global scale, interfering in the widespread displacement of people, tourism, local and even international markets. Once China's economy is a worldwide reference, its disruption leads to a global impact in the supply chains and the production itself. [1] [2] [3] The Coronaviridae family, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, includes a large variability of viruses and became recognized in the spring of 2003, when a human coronavirus caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [4] [5] [6] [7] Based on phylogenetic analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a lineage B betacoronavirus 8 and belongs to the same group as SARS-CoV-1 and HKU9-1, the bat coronavirus, demonstrating wide similarity with both genetically 9 (96,2% of sequence identity with HKU9-1). 10 The transmission was confirmed to be human-to-human once several medical care personnel and relatives got infected, 8, 9 but it is believed that it all started with an animal host, may it be a bat or another intermediate host. 7, 9, 11, 12 Even though the virus usually does not cause severe damage to the body, as will be explained below, the major concern is its high infectivity and pathogenicity. 8, 12, 13 The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, 14 generally causes mild upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in fever and cough, yet it can also affect the lower effective neutralizing Abs which is relevant for the future prevention and treatment of this now widespread illness that should be immediately controlled. At the end, a new designed mAb candidate is proposed based on our present in silico findings.
Computational virology is an emergent research field that takes advantage of the progress from molecular and structural biology, immunology, bioinformatics and related areas to foster the understanding of virus, their evolutionary dynamics in nature, infectivity, pathogenesis, cell/hosttropism, viral assembly and their molecular interactions in general (including how to predict epitopes, how to design specific neutralizing antibodies and basically any drug design & discovery related to viral infections). [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] In particular, structural and interactive aspects can benefit from the solid foundations that computational molecular simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) 35, 36 and Monte Carlo (MC) 35, 37 have achieved to probe the thermodynamic, dynamics and interactive properties of biomolecules in material science, food and pharma (see refs. 38, 39 for reviews). Here, we applied a fast constant-pH MC scheme 40, 41 for protein-protein studies 42, 43 to improve our understanding of the molecular interactions involving SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins and to identify key amino acids for the host-pathogen interactions.
Several molecular systems were investigated in the present study employing the two SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins (see Figure 1 ) with ACE2 and the fragments of the mAbs 80R, CR3022, m396, and F26G29. Typically, these fragments of mAbs are fusion proteins from . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Additional calculations were carried out for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with a new proposed mAb based on CR3022. For most of these macromolecules, three dimensional crystallographic structures are available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB): 44 a) the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein was extracted from the PDB id 2AJF (chain E, resolution 2.9Å, pH 7.5) where it was found complexed with ACE2 (chain A) − see Figure 2 ; b) the fragment of the Ab 80R was taken out from the PDB id 2GHW (chain B, resolution 2.3Å, pH 4.6); c) the anti-SARS-CoV-1 m396 Ab was extracted from the PDB id 2G75 (chains A and B, resolution 2.28Å, pH 8.5) removing part of the chains to keep only the variable regions and the short linker peptide; d) F26G19 Fab was taken out from PDB id 3BGF (chains L and C, resolution 3.0Å, pH 5.5), following the same procedure used for m396. Missing regions in these proteins were built up using the "UCSF Chimera 1.11.2" interface 45 of the program "Modeller" with default parameters. 46 Figure 3 shows their final three-dimensional structures as used in this work. All PDB files were edited before the calculations. Water molecules and hetero atoms were completely removed from all used files. The "UCSF Chimera 1.11.2" package 45 was employed for all molecular visualizations and representations too.
When this study started, no experimental structure was available for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. A model was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace (YP_009724390.1) based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512. 47 The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions between this modeled structure for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the available one for SARS-CoV-1 (PDB id 2AJF) is 0.638Å. The structural comparison between the RBD proteins of both SARS viruses can be seen in Figure 1 . Recently, new experimental structures were solved. For example, a cryo-EM structure is now available for the prefusion S glycoprotein with a single incomplete RBD (PDB id 6VSB, resolution 3.46Å). The RMSD between our model and the S RBD (chain A) from this structure is 0.790Å. This number is closer to the RMSD differences between two chains of the same experimental (PDB id 6VSB) trimer structure (e.g. 0.668Å for chain A x chain B, and 0.732Å for chain A x chain C). Such diversity of possible conformations might motivate further studies exploring their effects on the theoretical predictions. These RMSD values also indicate that the modeled structure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as used here is reasonable and within the expected conformational fluctuations from any other structure that could have been chosen for this work. Moreover, an intrinsic assumption here is that an experimental structure obtained at a given and specific physical chemical condition (ionic strength, pH, PEG6000 concentration, etc.) is valid in another condition. 27 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint Only standard amino acids of chain A (ACE2) and E (SARS-CoV-1 S RBD) are shown in a molecular representation using spheres for its atoms. Atoms are colored accordingly to their amino acids physical chemical properties: red for acid amino acids, blue for base amino acids and gray for non-titrating amino acids. For a better visualization of the interface, the ACE2 structure was translated ~12 Å.
CR3022 is a particularly successful SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing human mAb first isolated from a convalescent patient by ter Meulen and co-authors. 48 For the present study, its three dimensional structure (see Figure 3 ) was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace 47 The fragments of the mAbs 80R (PDB id 2GHW), CR3022 (modeledsee the text for details), F26G19 (PDB id 3BGF) and m396 (PDB id 2G75) are shown in a ribbon representation.
A large diversity of models is available for MD and MC molecular simulations. 38, [49] [50] [51] [52] The need to repeat the calculations on several different physical chemical conditions and to obtain free energy of interactions at them drives the options to the so-called cost-effective coarse-grained (CG) models. These CG models offer the possibility to explore the main physical features of a system with a reduced number of parameters and lower computational costs. 27, 42, 43 During the last years, a fast constant-pH (CpH) CG model has been devised to successfully study proteinprotein interactions of several biological systems (including host-pathogens interactions). 27, 42, 43, 53, 54 The possibility to fully consider the pH effects makes this modeling approach more appealing and appropriated to address this problem. 27, 55 .

The S RBD proteins and the fragments of the mAbs were modeled as rigid bodies (i.e. bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles are kept fixed) formed by a set of amino acids placed at positions given by their three-dimensional structures as described above.

This CG process turns a protein atomistic structure as a collection of charged LJ particles representing their amino acids. The centers-of-masses of the beads (mimicking amino acids) are used to place them accordingly to the coordinates given by the three-dimensional structures. The values of Ri for each type of amino acids were taken from ref. 53 . The valences of all ionizable residues are a function of the solution pH. The fast proton titration scheme (FPTS) 40, 41, 52 was employed both to initially assign these valences zi´s for the amino acids and to let them vary during the simulation sampling at a given pH. This method has proved to predict pKa´s with a very good accuracy at low computational costs. 41 The fundamental physical chemical basis of this titration scheme, its numerical implementation, benchmarks, discussions related to its approximations, pros and cons can be found in previous publications. 40, 41, 52, 59 As illustrated in Figure 4 , two proteins are placed in an electroneutral open cylindrical simulation box, and free to translate back and forward along the axis in which their centers are laying, rotate in any direction and titrate. In this example, these two proteins are the modeled three dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and the crystallographic structure of the fragment of the mAb 80R. Unless otherwise specified, simulation runs were carried out with a cell of radius (rcyl) and height (lcyl) equals to 150 and 200Å, respectively. The static dielectric .

Counter-ions and added salt particles were represented implicitly using a screening term, i.e., for two ionizable amino acids i and j, the screening is given by [exp(-κrij)] where κ is the modified inverse Debye length, and rij is the interparticle separation distance. 27, 42, 43, 60 Additionally, a simplified simulation box with only one protein present was used to characterize the titration properties of a single macromolecule.
The electrostatic interactions[ ( )] between any two ionizable amino acids of valences and are given by: Protein-protein interactions are also controlled by other physical contributions (van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic effect, and excluded volume repulsion). 27, 42, 43 A simple and effective way to include their effects is by means of a LJ term [uvdw(rij)] between the beads (amino acids). 27 Mathematically, for any two beads (charged or neutral ones) i and j, uvdw(rij) is given by 6 ], [2] where σij (= Ri + Rj) is the separation distance of two amino acids i and j at contact. For instance, σij for the pair VAL-GLU is 7.2Å (= RVAL + RGLU, where RVAL = 3.4Å and RGLU = 3.8Åsee ref. 53 ). The possibility to use different sizes for these beads allows the incorporation of non-.

This also implies that the outcomes should be interpreted with relative caution bearing in mind all the intrinsic approaches assumed in the modeling. The direct impact is seen in the free energy derivatives as discussed later at the results section.
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2), the total system's interaction energy for a given configuration
can be written as:
, [3] where { } are amino acid positions and is their total number. This includes both charged and neutral beads.

Furthermore, it seems controversial in the experimental works if the acidification is essential or not for uptake of cell-free SARS virus. 22, 23, 25 The exact value of the acid pH condition is unknown. We made a choice to use the pH value of the crystallographic environment more acid among the studied structures (pH 4.6 for PDB id 2GHW). This also made possible to easily investigate the behavior of the systems at intermediate conditions by interpolation from the present outcomes.
After the proper equilibration of the simulated molecular systems, long production runs were carried out. Simulations whose focus was on titration properties [Z(pH) and pKas] required The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint that the interface antibody-antigen has a peculiar electrostatic pattern (richer in titratable groups) that is different than other general protein-protein interfaces, 65 etc.]. 27, 55 Such facts contribute to shift the canonical view of the "lock and key" (with a clear focus on the protein surface) to a broader definition that led to the "electrostatic epitopes" (EE) concept. 27 This means that inner titratable groups (not only the ones at the epitope-paratope interface) can also participate in the interplay of interactions with Abs.
The EEs are the core idea of the PROCEEDpKa method 27 where pKa shifts are used to identify the key amino acids responsible for a host-pathogen association. It applies the fact that the location of these shifts is a practical mean to probe molecular interactions as before demonstrated. 67 Moreover, this can be easily measured during computer simulations of a proteinprotein complexation. The predictive properties of this powerful tool have been previously i) statistically analyzed for flaviviruses, ii) compared to other bioinformatic tools (that often ignore that pH and ionic strength can drastically affect the complexation process) and iii) discussed in details in a preceding work. 27 The capacity of this method to test EE for specific mAbs makes it even more appealing for the present study where four known mAbs should be investigated. For the sake of convenience, predicted EE for the studied systems were graphically compared at the sequence level. The pairwise sequence alignments were generated by the server EMBOSS Needle 68 with default settings.

One of the central questions in the understanding of the COVID-19, its pathology including the high transmissibility, and the possible therapeutic interventions to control the epidemics spreading is to decipher and prevent the molecular interactions between the S protein and ACE2. 25 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint difference of 0.2nM could be due to several reasons including the experimental uncertainties that were not reported in Tian's work. 8 In contrast to these results, another recent study 20 advocated that SARS-CoV-2 has greater binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1. Even so, both the present theoretical and previously reported experimental data do agree that SARS-CoV-1 S RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S RBD have similar attraction to the ACE2. This high binding affinity implies that all human organs rich on ACE2 (oral and nasal mucosa, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) 76,77 can be easily infected. A clear opportunity for the virus is the lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, where ACE2 is abundant. 76 Note that the simulations were performed with a single RBD protein in the absence of the full structure of the S protein and the others two chains of the homotrimeric S glycoprotein. This brings with it the evidence that the other structural parts of the S1 subunit, the S2 subunit and the two other chains are not essential for the individual pair of RBD-ACE2 complexation. Also, this observation supports the argument that the dissociation of the S1 subunit complexed with ACE2 can happen without the interruption of the infection. This also allows the S2 subunit to transit from a metastable prefusion to its post-fusion state as a second step in the viral infection. 58, 78 At pH 4.6 which is closer to the low pH that occur outside the cell, 23 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint free-energy landscape must be interpreted with care as we already have pointed out above. By one side, it can be used a simple thermodynamic criterion that a negative free energy value (βwmin<0) would result in a molecular complex. Conversely, any free energy value smaller than the thermal energy (1 kBT) would indicate an unstable association. The observed difference ( βwmin) of 0.07 between the two RDB proteins is greater than the estimated statistical errors.
However, we prefer to interpret such small differences as tendencies of the system. Based on previous studies 27, 42, 43, 54, 60 where we have observed either that the computed complexation was weaker than the experimental measurements or too much stronger, we feel safer to use this data (and the others discussed below) in relative terms (i.e. comparing different situations). This allows us to successfully predict experimental observations respecting the limits of such CG models. 27, 42, 43, 54 The similarities between their free energy minima are relatively amplified at pH 4.6 ( βwmin=0.07 as seen above) in comparison with pH 7.0 where βwmin is −1.11 and −1.06 ( βwmin=0.05). Both viral S RBD proteins have their affinities to ACE2 slightly raised when pH is increased from the acid to the neutral regime. This somewhat higher binding affinity at neutral pH suggests that the role of pH for RBD proteins constantly under debate at the literature 22, 25, 73, 80 might not be so critical for the infection. It also reinforces the possibility that the viral cell invasion is not a pH-dependent process. Indeed, it seems that pH is more relevant for the next steps to continue the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This possible non pH-depend process might increase the opportunities for the SARS viruses to easily infect cells and therefore to contribute to its high infectivity. This might limit the use of chloroquine as an efficient drug against COVID-19 since its first action is to increase the cell pH. At least a neutral pH solution will not prevent the binding of the RBD to ACE2. On the opposite as it can favor this affinity.

Following the work of Tian and collaborators, 8 we investigated the interactions between the two SARS S RBD proteins with some of the most potent SARS-CoV-1 S RBD specific neutralizing antibodies (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022). Figure 6 shows the free energy profiles at the acid regime and physiological salt conditions. For all studied fragments of Abs, a relatively stronger attraction is always observed for the S RBD protein from the SARS-CoV-1 interacting with any of these mAbs. This can be better seen in Figure 6b Moreover, the work of Tian and co-authors suggested that only for CR3022 it was experimentally measured a reasonable binding. 8 The combination of these information could indicate that a threshold of −0.67KBT for βwmin can be used to better refine the theoretical binding predictions of these macromolecular complexations (i.e. all viral protein-protein systems with a value of βwmin smaller than −0.67KBT are expected to experience binding in vivo at least). Table   S1 summarizes the values of βwmin given between parenthesis.

Next, we explored basic physical chemical aspects that could offer a simple and quick reasoning to understand the above free energy results and eventually be used as descriptors to scan databases of mAbs to filter promising ideal candidates. Although different driven forces can result in protein-protein complexation, 42, 43 pH and charge-charge interactions seems especially important for viral proteins. 27, 55, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] Indeed, the protein net charges numbers (Z) obtained as function of the solution pH show that the SARS-CoV-2 S RDB protein is always slightly more positively charged than SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein at the same physical chemical environment (Z equals to 5.2 and 5.5, respectively, for them at pH 4.6) − see table 1. Since all studied fragments of Abs are also positively charged at pH 4.6 (Z equals to 9.1, 4.2, 2.7, 5.8 for 80R, CR3022, m396 and F26G19, respectively), it can be easily seen that the order observed for the binding affinities above in the free energy analyses do follow a simple charge-charge rule for the mAbs with similar surface area (A~10,000 Å 2 ). For the SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein, from the weaker to the stronger repulsive cases in terms of the Coulomb contributions (Zi*Zj assuming the same Bjerrum length, salt screening and separation distances 42, 43, 86 ) , the predicted order for the binding affinity is 80R (5.2*9.1=47.3) < F26G19 (5.2*5.8=30.2) < CR3022 (5.2*4.2=21.8). This agrees with the previous free energy analyses (see above). As large is A, larger is the attractive van der Waals interactions that can overcome the charge-charge repulsion. This can also explain why m396 (that is smaller and has roughly half of A) is less attracted to the RBD proteins even being slightly less positively charged (Z equals to 2.7 at pH 4.6) than the others (Z~5-6).
Similarly, this is the physical reason to understand the stronger binding affinity that ACE2 (A=25,290Å 2 ) has to the S RBD proteins. Although ACE2 (Z=5.4) and F26G19 (Z=5.8) have similar Zs, the molecular surface of ACE2 is ca. 2.5 times larger than F26G29 (A=10,120Å 2 ).

We tested the van der Waals (vdw) contribution comparing w(r) for CR3022 and m396 in a model where all electrostatic interactions where completely switched off and only vdw interactions are considered. This test-case system is shown in Figure S1 . It can be seen that m396 in this hypothetical test does have a weaker binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein in comparison to CR3022 confirming the arguments above presented. and R194) can be seen in Figure 7 at the wild type structure of CR3022.

Two amino acids substitutions (K170A and R194A) are suggested at this biological interface while the other one (K12E) is more peripheral (see Figure 7 ). Doing such mutations, the Z of the new molecule (labeled CR3022') drops down from +4.2 to +1.2 at pH 4.6 and from +1.0 to −3.0 at pH 7.0.
The binding affinity of this computer-designed molecule was tested. The calculated w(r) for this new fragment of mAb is given in Figure 8 . As it can be seen, CR3022' is now able to bind with an equivalent binding affinity to what was observed for the SARS-CoV-1S RBD-CR3022 system. βwmin decreased from −0.79 to −0.85 recovering the value found for the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD-CR3022 case − see Figure 6 and Table S1 . Therefore, this is a promising designed mAb candidate to be carefully and systematically examined in further experimental assays.

To refine this analysis at the sequence level, the PROCEEDpKa method 27 was employed to determine the EE of the RBD proteins for the most relevant studied complexes. Three questions should be addressed here: 1) if SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins share a common binding region when they bind to ACE2; 2) if these viral RBD proteins interact with the mAbs using a similar epitope-paratope interface; 3) if the interaction with CR3022 and CR3022' involves the same EE. The data to answer such questions is given in Figures 9 and 10 . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint In Figure 9 , the primary sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins are plotted together with the estimated ionizable amino acids of the interface with ACE2 and the antigenic regions as defined by the PROCEEDpKa method. By the different distribution of amino acids identified as EE (shown in blue), it can be seen that the electrostatic method is sensitive to the structures and their titratable groups that can produce electrical perturbations on their partners when they are interacting as demonstrated before. 27 The patterns observed for both viral SARS proteins are similar (i.e. they share a common region when they bind to ACE2) although some interesting observations can be made. Comparing the number of ionizable residues involved in the interactions for the RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and ACE2 with the pair SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2, we can see an increase from 30 to 40 with a high number of common cases (22 amino acids) where the same amino acid interacts with ACE2 for both viral proteins. Most of the differences are observed for neighbor groups (e.g. "AWERKKISN" for SARS-CoV-1 and "AWNRKRISN" for SARS-CoV-2) indicating that the same biological interface was explored by the two viral RBD proteins in spite of their structural differences. The RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 clearly has more titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor. This observation suggests that its binding to ACE2 might be less specific than what happens for SARS-CoV-1. As such, the presence of an Ab may not completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2 interaction. In general, as seen in this Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377 doi: bioRxiv preprint common cases is 12 while some regions are more affected by their structural differences (e.g.
"DYSVLYNSTFFSTFKCYG" for SARS-CoV-1 and "DYSVLYNSASFSTFKCYG" for SARS-CoV-2). A replacement of an amino acid from the same physical chemical group (e.g. D by E) can be enough to result in different interactions (e.g. "KGDDVRQIA" for SARS-CoV-1 and "RGDEVRQIA" for SARS-CoV-2). CR3022 perturbed more titratable groups: 27 for SARS-CoV-1 and 33 for SARS-CoV-2. Taking into account what was hypothesized for ACE2 above, this might be an addition contribution to improve the capability of this mAb to interact and inhibit the RBD proteins. In fact, the experimental work of Tian and colleagues 8 do show that the CR3022 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is not affected by ACE2. This might be the molecular basis for this behavior. We are careful with the use of stronger statements here due to the limitation of the theoretical approach. Several additional issues remain to be further investigated.
Finally, we compared the EE predictions for CR3022' (34 aa) with CR3022 (33 aa) interacting with SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein − see Figure 10 . The predicted EEs for the interaction with CR3022' are essentially the same ones observed for CR3022 (27 common aa) . This implies that the suggested mutations here do not affected the antigenic regions. Another particularly interesting feature of this computer-designed molecule is that the number of EEs shared with ACE2 has increased from 18 (for CR3022) to 27 (for CR3022'). This might amplify the potential of this mAb candidate to better block the virus-host cell interaction. CR3022' by the electrostatic method. Data for CR3022 is the same shown in Figure 9 . All other details are also as in Figure 9 .
Free energies of interactions were calculated for several molecular complexes involving the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins. The present theoretical results confirmed that both RBD proteins have similar binding affinity to the ACE2 as previously reported in experimental studies. This is observed at both acid and neutral pH regimes which probably indicates that the medium pH it is not so relevant for the beginning of the viral cell invasion. pH seems to be more important for the next steps of the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This has a direct implication for the drug development since the proposal of some like chloroquine is to raise cell pH.

The only mAb with measured affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein by BLI assay was CR3020 8 which was also the one with higher affinity quantified in the present theoretical study. Moreover, we could map their electrostatic epitopes and identify that all mAbs tend to share the same titratable residues, and they are like the residues involved in the interaction with ACE2. However, the RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 clearly has more titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor suggesting that its binding to ACE2 might be less specific. This can explain the general difficulty that mAbs can experience to completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2 interaction.
Charge-charge interactions were found to be a good simple descriptor for a fast screening to the designing of improved mAb for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Our theoretical approach, while still being further developed, has identified three amino acids substitution that can increase the binding affinity of CR3022 to the RBD protein responsible for the present pandemic. These results can contribute to guide the design of new functional and high specific mAbs providing a cost-and-time-effective computational framework towards the development of better diagnostic strategies and an effective treatment and/or vaccine for COVID-19.
