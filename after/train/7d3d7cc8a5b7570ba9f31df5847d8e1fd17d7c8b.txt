COVID-19, the coronavirus-transmitted infectious disease, has caused a worldwide pandemic. Smoking 1 2 and e-cigarette use 3 increase risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage to upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function. In particular, smokers have a higher risk of infection and mortality from Cov-MERS. 4 Two reviews 5 6 of the first 5 papers presenting data on smoking and COVID-19 reached different conclusions. Another review described 6 published case series presenting data on smoking among COVID-19 patients but did not draw a conclusion about the association of severity of COVID-19 with smoking. 7 We reviewed and summarized 12 papers presenting data on the association between smoking and severity of COVID-19.
We conducted a systematic search using PubMed database on April 6, 2020, with the search term: ((smoking) OR (characteristics) OR (risk factors) OR (outcomes) OR (smoker*)) AND ((COVID-19) OR (COVID) OR (coronavirus) OR (sars cov-2) OR (sars cov 2)) for studies published between January 1, 2020 and April 6, 2020. There were no language restrictions. A total of 396 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 12, 10 from China, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 1 from Korea, 18 and 1 from the US, 19 included data on smoking behavior and COVID-19 disease progression (Table 1 ). Ten studies 8 10-18 were based on hospitalized patients and two 9 19 included both hospitalized patients and outpatients.
The exposure group is those who had a history of smoking (current smokers or former smokers) and unexposed group was never smokers. Five studies 8 10 12 14 17 assessed whether the patient was a "current smoker," three studies 9 16 19 assessed whether the patient was a current or All rights reserved.

Outcome is progression of COVID-19 to more severe or critical conditions or death (Table 1) . Two studies 14 16 categorized the outcome as severe (respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥30/min, or oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or oxygenation index ≤300 mmHg, based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese National Health Committee 16 ) or mild, three 8 11 12 categorized the outcome as progression or improvement, two 10 19 categorized the outcome as ICU admission or non-ICU admission, one 9 categorized the outcome as the primary composite end point (ICU admission, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death) or not, two 15 17 categorized the outcome as death or survivor, one 13 categorized the outcome as the occurrence of severe cases (without defining severe) or death or mild, and one 18 categorized the outcome as clinical deterioration during the hospitalization and needed supplemental oxygen therapy.
We computed unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study using the number of smokers (current and former) and never smokers with and without disease progression. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using the Stata 14.0 metan command and using metabias command with Harbord and Peters to test for the presence of publication bias.

A total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients included in our meta-analysis, 878 of whom (9.7%) experienced disease progression and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). A total of 88 patients with a history of smoking (17.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 9.3% of never smoking patients.
The meta-analysis showed an association between smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001) ( Figure 1 ). There was not significant heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 =28.9%, p=0.162) or publication bias (Harbord's p=0.155, Peters' p=0.668).
Our analysis confirms that smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having 2.25-times the odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes than never smokers. This finding contrasts with an earlier meta-analysis, 6 which included only 5 studies and used a nonstandard method to compute the meta-analysis. The finding that smoking is associated with COVID-19 progression is not surprising because of the adverse effects of smoking on pulmonary immune function. 1 2 Our study has several limitations.
The definition of "smoking" sometimes includes former smokers and sometimes does not. Only three studies 9 16 19 separated current and former smokers in different categories, which was not enough data to do a meta-analysis for current and former smokers separately. Because the lung recovers after someone stops smoking, including former smokers in the exposed group biases the effect estimate to the null.

It is highly likely that many smokers were misclassified as nonsmokers, which also biases the risk estimate toward the null.
We computed and assessed unadjusted odds ratios based on the numbers of patients reported in the studies. Only one 11 None of these studies assessed e-cigarette use.
All these limitations suggest that this analysis underestimates the risk of smoking in terms of increasing COVID-19 severity.
All 12 studies were of patients who had already developed COVID-19, so the risk estimate we report does not represent the effect of smoking on the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the general population. As population-level testing ramps up, it would be useful to collect data on smoking and e-cigarette use to determine what risks these behaviors impose in terms of infection.
Smoking is associated with COVID-19 disease progression. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking and, given the pulmonary effects of e-cigarettes, 3 e-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
