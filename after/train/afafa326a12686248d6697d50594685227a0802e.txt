A mathematical model that can be used to estimate the total number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic is presented in this study. The parameters and the associated uncertainty in the model are optimized and quantified using various reported data sets reported from different countries. The results suggest that, by the mid of June or early July 2020, the outbreak will strongly decay and the US will have about 800K confirmed cases and less than 50K deaths.
Italy, Spain, and China. The model was then used to predict 23 the total mortality number in these countries and forecast a 24 safe reopening date in the US. The modeling approach is divided into three major steps: (i) This modeling approach assumes that, at a given day dur-43 ing the outbreak, there will be a certain percentage of infection where, y represents the number of confirmed patients "P" cases 58 or reported deaths "D". The parameter yss refers to the steady-59 state (saturation) number in which there will be no more 
This study presents a mathematical model that can be used to estimate the total number of cases and deaths in the US due to COVID-19. The model forecasting about ∼< 800K cases and ∼< 50K total numbers of deaths in the United States. The results suggest that late May or early June, 2020 is probably a good time to end the shutdown order and reopen the country for the daily routine business.

In other words, we minimize the RMS error between the cal-77 culated and the reported data of confirmed cases and deaths 78 as:
We have used a Matlab function lsqnonlin to find a set of 81 model parameters which minimize RMS. This procedure will 82 provide regression parameters (best-fit values) that define the 83 shape and time for the curve. The fitted Hill-like equation will 84 also follow a sigmoid shape at any value of n. In each distribution occurs at day that is different from one 144 another. For instance and according to the present analysis, 145 the US death peak didn't occur yet. This peak is expected to 146 occur on April 15, 2020 leaving behind about (∼ 2.1K) deaths 147 during this date. Similar results can be obtained for both Italy 148 and Spain cases. The results suggested that the death rate 149 has started to decline in both Italy and Spain.
In figure (4) , the total number of deaths in the USA, China, 151 Italy, and Spain represented by polar plots. The filled circles 152 indicate the data collected. The solid spiral line refers to the 153 model prediction parameterized by the number of days. The 154 radius of the dotted circle refers to the total number of deaths. 155 The model predicts a total death of about Dss =∼ 50K by 156 the end of this pandemic. This is clearly shown from the 157 spiral trajectory which attains a steady state value by mid 158 May, 2020. In other words, the number of mortality in the 159 US will stay bounded by a circle having a radius of ∼ 50K 160 deaths. Of course, as time progress this pandemic decays 161 and assuming that all the necessary medical equipment (ICUs 162 and Ventilators, etc..) becomes available, the total number of 163 deaths in the US can be significantly reduced.
