Although infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is spreading rapidly worldwide, no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating COVID-19. We previously found that nafamostat mesylate, an existing drug used for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), effectively blocked MERS-CoV S protein-initiated cell
fusion by targeting TMPRSS2, and inhibited MERS-CoV infection of human lung epithelium-derived Calu-3 cells. Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active.
Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an EC50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion. These findings, together with accumulated clinical data regarding its safety, make nafamostat a likely candidate drug to treat COVID-19.

As yet, no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating COVID-19. Therefore, drug repurposing offers potentially the quickest path toward disease treatment.
The genomic RNA of coronaviruses is surrounded by an envelope 2 . Initiation of viral entry requires two steps: 1) the Spike (S) protein in the viral envelope, binds to its receptor present in the plasma membrane after S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 proteins by the cellular protease. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while MERS-CoV uses CD26 as a receptor; 2) S2 is cleaved by a cell surface transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), so-called priming, which exposes the fusion peptide in S2 protein, allowing it to attach to the plasma membrane resulting in the fusion between envelope and the plasma membrane (envelope fusion). This fusion allows the viral RNA to enter the cytoplasm, where it replicates. TMPRSS2-knockout resulted in reduced spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the airways accompanied by reduced severity of lung pathology in a mouse model 3 . Therefore, TMPRSS2 is likely crucial for SARS-CoV-2 spreading and disease development in vivo, and targeting it either by inhibiting its priming activity or suppressing its expression is likely to be an effective strategy to cure COVID-19.

We have previously reported that nafamostat mesylate, an existing Japanese drug used for acute pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with enhanced fibrinolysis, effectively inhibits MERS-CoV S protein-initiated membrane fusion by targeting TMPRSS2 priming activity 4 . We did this using the cell fusion assay monitored by the Dual Split Protein (DSP) reporter to screen the FDA-approved drug library (Fig. 1a) .
Calu-3 cells.
Based on our previous work 4 together with others' 5 , we established an experimental system monitoring SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion, and tested ACE2 and TMPRSS2 dependence in 293FT cells, which do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1bd) . Fusion did not occur when target cells lacked either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1c) , indicating that the cell fusion clearly depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as previously reported for MERS-CoV S protein-initiated fusion, which depends on CD26 and TMPRSS2 4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1a ). Furthermore, when ACE2-kockout Calu-3 cells, endogenously expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were used as target cells, fusion scarcely occurred, suggesting that no other functional receptor exists in some types of lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1e) .

We then tested the activity of three existing Japanese drugs used for pancreatitis and/or DIC (nafamostat mesylate, camostat mesylate and gabexate mesylate) with inhibitory activity against serine proteases to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated fusion (Fig. 1f) .
Luciferase activities derived from cells carrying the preformed DSP1-7/DSP8-11 reporter complex were not affected by the drugs (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b ), indicating that the suppression of luciferase activities reflects the inhibition of fusion by drugs.
Nafamostat mesylate showed greatest activity, camostat mesylate was 10-fold less active, and gabexate mesylate was inactive within the range of concentrations tested (10 nM-10 µM) We next used lung epithelium-derived Calu-3 and H3255 cells as target cells, because they endogenously express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and might better reflect physiological conditions than 293FT kidney cells ectopically expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Nafamostat mesylate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion in the range of 1-10 nM while camostat mesylate required 10 -100 nM to achieve a similar extent of inhibition (Fig. 1g) . A similar inhibition profile was observed when MERS-CoV S protein-initiated fusion was analyzed 4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1d ).

Furthermore, drug concentrations required for fusion inhibition in lung epithelial cells were 10-fold lower than those required for inhibition using 293FT cells (Fig. 1f, g) .
Various computational approaches have recently been applied to find existing medications targeting TMPRSS2 6, 7 . Consistent with our results, these studies ranked nafamostat mesylate significantly higher than camostat mesylate. It should be noted that several world-wide commercially available anticoagulants, which are serine protease inhibitors targeting Factor Xa or Thrombin, are listed. Therefore, we checked whether these anticoagulants affect SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion. Contrary to expectations, they all failed to inhibit membrane fusion (Fig. 1h ).
Our DSP assays identified nafamostat mesylate as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 S-initiated membrane fusion ( Fig. 1f , g). This inhibition was most likely a result of inhibition of TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane 2 . SARS-CoV-2 infects Calu-3 cells primarily via the TMPRSS2-dependent plasma membrane pathway 4, 5, 8 , while it infects VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells via the TMPRSS2-independent endocytotic pathway in addition to the plasma membrane pathway 9 . We then proceeded to evaluate the effects of nafamostat mesylate on actual SARS-CoV-2 infection in both types of cells with or without pretreatment .

Based on the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), EC50 values for Calu-3 cells were 6.8-11.5 nM (with pretreatment) and 3.16 µM (without pretreatment) while those for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were 31.6 µM (with pretreatment) and >100 µM (without pretreatment) (Fig. 1i) . In both cell types, EC50 values were much smaller when cells were pretreated with nafamostat mesylate, implying that nafamostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry. More importantly, EC50 values for Calu-3 cells with the pretreatment were around 10 nM, similar to our previous findings with MERS-CoV infection 4 However here we clearly demonstrate that nafamostat mesylate blocks membrane fusion step of the virus entry and its activity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection is cell type dependent.
These findings are crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. It has been reported recently that abnormal coagulation with elevated concentrations of D-dimer, characteristic of DIC with enhanced fibrinolysis, may influence the prognosis of COVID-19 14, 15 . Furthermore, in a murine asthma model, nafamostat mesylate attenuates respiratory inflammation by blocking activation of NF-kB, a critical transcription factor for inflammatory cytokine production 16 . Therefore, nafamostat mesylate is expected to have multiple therapeutic effects. Because nafamostat mesylate has been prescribed in Japan for many years and adequate clinical data regarding safety have accumulated, we suggest that it should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients by itself or in combination with other antiviral drugs that target separate processes needed for virus production. DSP assay to monitor membrane fusion. For the DSP assay using 293FT cells, effector cells expressing S protein with DSP8-11 and target cells expressing CD26 or ACE2, and TMPRSS2 with DSP1-7 were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates (2 x 10 5 cells/500 µl) one day before the assay. Two hours before the DSP assay, cells were treated with 6 µM EnduRen (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), a substrate for Renilla luciferase, to activate EnduRen. One µl of each protease inhibitor or anticoagulant dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the 384-well plates (Greiner Bioscience, Frickenhausen, Germany). Next, 50 µl of each single cell suspension (effector and target cells) was added to the wells using a Multidrop dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, the RL activity was measured using a Centro xS960 luminometer (Berthold, Germany).

Two hours before the DSP assay, cells were treated with 6 µM EnduRen. One µl of each protease inhibitor or anticoagulant dissolved in DMSO was added to the 384-well plates with 9 µl of culture medium. Next, 40 µl of single cell suspension (effector cells) was added to the wells using a Multidrop dispenser. Experiments were done in quadruplicate. Effector cells (293FT cells expressing DSP8-11 and S protein) and target cells (293FT or Calu-3 cells expressing DSP1-7, ACE2 and TMPRSS2) were co-cultured. Both GFP (fluorescence) and RL (luminescence) signals were generated following DSP1-7 and DSP8-11 reassociation upon cell fusion. c Different combinations of the effector and target cells were cocultured, and the resulting RL activity was measured. Relative cell-fusion values were calculated by normalizing the RL activity of each co-culture to that of the co-culture of cells expressing S protein with those expressing both receptor and TMPRSS2, which was set to 100%. d Phase contrast images of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated-cell fusion.
