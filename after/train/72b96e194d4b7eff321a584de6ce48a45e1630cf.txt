Legionaries' disease. The Legionella genome codes more than 300 effector proteins able to 20 modulate host-pathogen interactions during infection. Among them are also enzymes altering the 21 host-ubiquitination system including bacterial ligases and deubiquitinases. In this study, based on 22 homology-detection screening on 305 Legionella effector proteins, we identified two Legionella 23 OTU-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529), LotA 24 (Lpg2248/Lem21) is already known). A crystal structure of LotC catalytic core (LotC14-310) was 25 determined at 2.4 Å and compared with other OTU deubiquitinases, including LotB. Unlike the 26 classical OTU-family, the structures of Legionella OTU-family (LotB and LotC) shows an 27 extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which define a novel class of 28 OTU-deubiquitinase. Despite structural differences in their helical lobes, both LotB and LotC 29 interact with ubiquitin. LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1') enabling specific 30 cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and 31 cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of catalytically inactive LotB and LotC 32 identified different categories of host-substrates for these two related DUBs. Together, our results 33 provide new structural insights of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles of 34 bacterial deubiquitinases in host-pathogen interactions. 35
It suggests that LotB binds to ubiquitin through the conserved binding interface with NEDD8, 156 while LotC interacts with ubiquitin through the specific residues present only in ubiquitin 157 ( Supplementary Fig. 2c) . 158 159
Linkage specificity of the OTU family relies on one of the following mechanisms: 1) additional 161 ubiquitin-binding domains, 2) ubiquitinated sequences in the substrates or 3) defined S1' or S2 162 ubiquitin-binding sites (Mevissen et al., 2013) . To define the minimal OTU domain for 163 biochemical and structural studies, we designed several constructs and tested their activity against 164 the di-Ub panel (Fig. 3a, b) . While LotC retained its activity with the predicted OTU domain (7-165 310), LotB lost its activity after deletion of 50 amino acids (300-350) located at the C-terminus 166 beyond the predicted OTU domain (11-283). Based on the LotB structure (PDB:6KS5, (Ma et al., 167 2020)), we assumed that this extra helical region might be required for the additional ubiquitin 168 binding site (S1') to accept the distal ubiquitin moiety from K63 Ub2 (Fig. 3c) . To understand the 169 detailed mechanism of linkage specificity of LotB and LotC at the molecular level, we determined 170 the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of LotC (LotC14-310) at 2.4 Å (Fig. 3d features in the S1 ubiquitin-binding site (Fig. 3c , d and Table 1 ). Whereas the overall fold of the 174 catalytic core of LotB and LotC resembles that of other OTU-deubiquitinases, both showed clear 175 differences in the helical arm region, which has been shown to interact with ubiquitin and it serves 176 as an S1 binding site (Mevissen et al., 2013) .

To gain better insights into the physiological roles of LotB and LotC, we decided to identify their 216 interacting proteins or substrates. First, to enrich for the interacting partners, catalytically inactive 217
LotB or LotC were expressed in cells and immuno-precipitated from cell lysates. Ubiquitin 218 (UBA52) is strongly enriched with both catalytically inactive LotB and LotC (Fig. 5a, c) . MS 219 analysis revealed that LotB mainly interacts with membrane protein complexes (COPB1, ATP5B, 220 ATP5H, COX5A, SEC61B). We also found interactions with some ER-resident proteins (Calnexin 221 (CANX), DDOST, STT3A). By contrast, most of the enriched proteins from the inactive LotC 222 pull-down were non-membrane-bound organelle-and ribosome-related proteins (RPS8, RPLP2, 223 RPS27, RPLP1, RPL13) (Fig. 5a, c) . To further understand this, we sought to find the cellular 224 localization of both DUBs (Fig. 5b, d) . Consistent with the recent publication, LotB specifically 225 co-localized with the ER marker protein Calnexin, but not with other organelle markers (TOMM20 226 and GM130 for Mitochondria and Golgi, respectively, Fig. 5b) , and the OTU domain itself failed 227 to localize on the ER (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). By contrast, we could not find a specific cellular 228 localization of LotC (Fig. 5d) . Next, to gain more insights into the functional roles of LotB and 229
LotC, we decided to explore combinatorial ubiquitination events with other ubiquitin-related 230 In this study, we have identified two novel bacterial OTU-deubiquitinases from Legionella, 245 which we suggest as founding members of a new sub-class. Unlike classical OTU-DUBs, the 246 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. LotC. Together, these findings establish important guidance on how to screen for more DUBs in 254 other pathogenic bacteria or viruses, how to characterize their physiological roles during infection. 255 We also showed that the two Legionella OTUs have different ubiquitin-binding modes 256 that enable them to cleave specific ubiquitin chains. With ubiquitin activity-based probes (Prg-, 257 VME-probes), we showed that LotB contains an extra ubiquitin-binding site (S1') and is specific 258 to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, wherease LotC cleaves different types of ubiquitin chains. 259
Interestingly, we observed a modification of LotB with NEDD8-Prg ABP. Further studies on 260 neddylated proteins with LotB will give us more insights into dual-activity of LotB. In contrast, 261 we could not see the modification between NEDD8-ABP and LotC and we reasoned that the Arg72 262 on ubiquitin, which is replaced by alanine in NEDD8, is important to locate the C-terminus of Deubiquitinases from bacteria and viruses have been shown to alter the host immune 268 system.
