For correct triaging of patients diagnostic testing is of key 102 importance. The leading standard test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is an RT-103 PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material (5). However, RT-PCR testing is time-104 consuming and shortage of testing materials and capacity imposes a serious 105 threat (6). 106 107 Doctors at the ED are required to assess the probability of SARS-CoV-2 108 infection in each patient entering the ED. To accelerate the triage process at 109 the ED, we integrated routine demographic, laboratory and imaging data of 110 patients presenting at the ED with COVID-19-like symptoms to develop a 111 All rights reserved.

This algorithm can assess whether a person, 112 presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms, is likely to have In case of a shortage of testing capacity, adoption of this algorithm could 114 reduce the number of patients for whom RT-PCR testing is required. 115
Moreover, implementation of the corona-score enables rapid decision making 116 at the ED, lowering pressure on isolation rooms. 117
In this retrospective multicenter study, 375 patients from three different 121 hospitals presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms and subsequent 122 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were included ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). Patients 123 from other departments and patients without any respiratory symptoms or 124 suspicion of COVID-19 were excluded. An independent cohort of 592 patients 125 from four hospitals was used to validate the model ( Figure 1 and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The final score is clamped from a 158 minimum of 0 to a maximum of 14 points.

Using a cohort of 375 ED patients with respiratory symptoms a point-based 177 algorithm was created and subsequently validated using a separate 178 independent cohort of 592 patients (Table 2 ). At the time of presentation at 179 the ED the parameters sex, age, CRP, ferritin, LDH, ALC, ANC and CXR 180 were significantly different between the COVID-19 positive and negative 181 patients ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ). Together, these parameters were used to 182 develop an algorithm, named 'corona-score'. Inclusion of albumin, 183 procalcitonin or clinical parameters such as fever, cough and dyspnea did not 184 sufficiently improve the performance of the algorithm (data not shown). The 185 corona-score resulted in a model with an AUROC of 0.94 ( Figure 3A , 95% CI 186 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Patients with a negative RT-PCR test had a median of 4 187 compared to a median of 11 for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ( Figure 3B and 188 Table 2 ). The corona-score algorithm was validated with data from 592 189 patients, yielding an AUROC of 0.91 ( Figure 3C , 95% CI 0.89-0.94). In the 190 validation population SARS-CoV-2 negative patients had a median of 3 191 versus a median of 11 for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ( Figure 3D and 192 (Table 3 ). Using corona-score cut-offs of 4 (96% sensitivity) 196
and 11 (95% specificity) at a 70% prevalence, this model showed negative 197 and positive predictive values of 88% and 96% ( Figure 3E ). The total false 198 rate given these conditions is 4% ( Figure 3E ). 199 2 after repeated RT-PCR testing (n=13) had an initial median corona-score of 206 12, while patients that remained negative (n=12) had an initial median corona-207 score of 4 ( Figure 3F ). This shows that the corona-score is able to distinguish 208 between true and false negatives. 209

However, in 238 most cases the patients with a mild presentation were not hospitalized. 239 Therefore, we consider that the low corona-score corresponds with the clinical 240 findings. On the other hand, some negatively-tested patients received a high 241 corona-score. This could be due to false-negative RT-PCR testing or possibly 242 other viral infections. Interestingly, four patients that were positive for 243 influenza and negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a low corona-score (2 -6). 244
During this COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of other respiratory viruses 245 appears very low; hence, the discriminative potential of the corona-score in 246 patients infected by such viruses could not be systematically established. 247
Notably, in case of any viral outbreak, a similar modelling approach could be 248 considered to develop an algorithm as described here. 249
The four laboratories involved in this study deploy different instruments from 251 the major in-vitro diagnostic device providers. Most measurands that were 252 included in the algorithm have an identical metrological traceability and hence 253 comparable results in the commutable EQA scheme of the SKML (8). 254
However, there is no reference method for ferritin (9). The different 255 calibrations lead to approximately 20% difference in ferritin results between 256 the methods employed by the laboratories in this study. Therefore, a 1.2 257 harmonization factor was applied to the ferritin values obtained from Siemens 258 instruments, before calculating corona-scores, correcting the lack of 259 standardization.
