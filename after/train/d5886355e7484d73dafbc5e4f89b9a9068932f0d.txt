Lung injury and fibrosis represent the most significant outcomes of severe and acute lung disorders, 35
including COVID-19. However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this 36 study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived 37 immunity-and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) manufactured under good manufacturing practice (GMP) 38 requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs through sequentially 39 differentiating hESCs with xeno-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct 40 from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher levels of proliferative, 41 immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both 42 pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the 43 survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through their paracrine functions. 44
IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and FDA-approved pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy 45 and safety profile in mice, monkeys and two severely ill COVID-19 patients in our pilot study. In light 46 of recent public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress 47 syndrome (ARDS), our findings indicate that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders. 48
To determine the secretion of human MMP1, cell culture supernatants were collected after 48 hours of 228 culture. The levels of human MMP1 protein were measured by a Human MMP1 ELISA Kit (Cusabio, 229
Wuhan, China; CSB-E04672h) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of TNF-α 230 (Expandbio, Beijing, China; Exp210030) and TGF-β1 (Expandbio, Exp210089) in the mouse lung 231 homogenates were measured using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. 232
To determine the activity of human MMP1, cell culture supernatants were collected after 48 hours of 234 culture.

As previously 294 described 28 , the whole-genome sequencing data was mapped to the hg19 reference genome by BWA 295 (version 0.7.15) using the 'mem' mode with default parameters. The genome coverage were calculated 296 by bedtools 29 . The normalized coverage depth for each bin was calculated by dividing the raw coverage 297 depth by the average sequencing depth. Duplicate reads were removed and the uniquely mapped reads 298
were retained for the copy-number variation (CNV) analysis, in which chromosomal sequences were 299 placed into bins of 500 kb in length. The repeat regions annotated for hg19 genome by RepeatMasker 300 (http://www. repeatmasker.org) were removed from the genomic sequence before calculating the 301 coverage. The CNV scatterplot was drawn using ggplot2. 302
Mouse lung histology was performed as follows. Briefly, the lung was dehydrated, paraffin-embedded 304 and cut into 4 µm sections. Lung sections were stained with H&E and Masson's trichrome stain for 305 assessment of pathological changes. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies 306 against α-SMA (Servicebio, Wuhan, China; GB13044), Fibronectin (Servicebio, GB13091), Collagen I 307 (Servicebio, GB13091) and GFP (Servicebio, GB13227). Immunofluorescence staining was performed 308 using antibodies against GFP (Servicebio, GB13227), CD31 (Servicebio, GB11063-3) and SPC 309 (Millipore, AB3786). 310
IMRCs were labeled with a lipophilic, near-infrared fluorescent dye 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethyl 312 indotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR; YEASEN, Shanghai, China; 40757ES25). IMRCs were suspended at 313 a concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells / mL and incubated with DiR buffer for 20 min at 37°C according to the 314 manufacturer's protocol. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 1000-1500 rpm for 5 min. After 315 washing twice with PBS and resuspension, the IMRCs were preheated at 37°C before infusion. Both 316
DiR-labeled and unlabeled cells (5 × 10 6 in 200 µL saline) were injected via the tail vein. 317

Serial fluorescence images were also 321 obtained in major organs ex vivo. In order to reduce autofluorescence, the ideal filter conditions for DiR 322 imaging were an excitation/emission spectrum in the near infrared range (750/780 nm) 30, 31 . 323
The flexiVentFX experimental platform was set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the 325 twenty-first day, after 3% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia, mice 326
were fixed supine within five to eight minutes, and endotracheal intubation was inserted in the middle of 327 a tracheotomy. After computer processing, indicators of lung function required were obtained, including 328 the inspiratory capacity (IC), respiratory resistance (Rrs), static compliance (Crs), elastic resistance (Ers), 329
Newtonian resistance, tissue damping (G), tissue elasticity (H) and forced vital capacity (FVC) 32 . 330
The lung tissue was completely removed, weighed by electronic balance, and the lung coefficient was 332 calculated according to the formula: wet lung weight (g) / total body weight (kg). 333
The BLM mouse model was generated by intratracheal injection of 1.5 mg.kg -1 bleomycin sulphate 335 (BLM; Bioway, China; DP721) in normal saline under light anaesthesia. The IMRCs were delivered 336 intravenously at 0 day or 1 day or 7 days or 14 days after injury. Mice were euthanized with 50 mg/mL 337 sodium pentobarbital (0.6 mg/10 g weight) according to published guidelines 33 . Animals were killed 21 338 days after BLM injury. After perfusion with normal saline, the left lungs were used for morphometric 339 analysis while the right lungs were removed and used for other analyses. 340
Mouse CT scans were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 342

The pilot study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
In this study, hESC-derived IMRCs were generated by passaging cells that are migrating from human 360 embryoid bodies (hEBs), using xeno-free reagents ( Fig. 1A and 1B). The clinical hESC line (Q-CTS-361 hESC-2) was prepared as described previously 20 . Clinical hESCs were maintained in Essential 8 TM basal 362 medium (E8) on vitronectin-coated plates, before dissociation into small clumps to form hEBs for 5 days. 363
Then, hEBs were transferred onto vitronectin-coated plates and cultured for 14 additional days. The hEBs 364 outgrowth cells were dissociated and passaged continuously in IMRCs Medium. After 5 passages, 365
IMRCs were harvested for characterization. IMRCs possessed fibroblast-like morphology (Fig. 1B) and 366 maintained diploid karyotypes at passage 5 (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, copy-number variation analysis by 367 whole genome sequencing data also indicated no chromosome aneuploidies, large deletions nor 368 duplication fragments were detected (Fig. 1D ). Next, we analyzed the expression profile of MSC-specific 369 genes (Fig. 1E ). IMRCs showed a pattern that greatly differed from hESCs, and closely resembled 370 author/funder. All rights reserved.

All pluripotency genes (POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, 371 ZFP42, SALL4), mesendoderm genes (MIXL1), and ectoderm genes (GAD1, GFAP) were extinguished 372 in both IMRCs and UCMSCs (Fig. 1E ). IMRCs expressed MSC-specific genes, including PDGFRA and 373 SPARC, and the MSC-specific surface markers NT5E (CD73), ENG (CD90), THY1 (CD105) and ITGB1 374 (CD29). Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed this surface marker profile (Fig. 1F, Fig.S1A, B) . By 375 contrast, IMRCs were negative for the hematopoietic surface markers PTPRC (CD45) and CD34. IMRCs 376 displayed the ability to undergo tri-lineage differentiation into mesenchymal tissues, such as adipose, 377 cartilage and bone cells (Fig. 1G, Fig.S1C ). The proliferation rate of IMRCs was higher than that of 378
UCMSCs at passage 15, suggesting that IMRCs have a stronger capacity for long-term self-renewal (Fig.  379 1H). Interestingly, IMRCs were generally smaller than UCMSCs (Fig. 1I) , suggesting that IMRCs can 380 pass through smaller blood vessels and capillaries more easily, and are thus may be less likely to cause 381 pulmonary embolism. To evaluate the clinical potential of the IMRCs, we measured the viability of 382
IMRCs suspended in a published clinical injection buffer at 4°C. We found that the viability of IMRCs 383 remained higher (93%) than UCMSCs (73%) after 48h (Fig. 1J) . 384
To clarify the degree of similarity between hESCs, IMRCs and primary UCMSCs at the whole 386 transcriptome level, we performed genome-wide profiling of IMRCs and UCMSCs and compared their 387 gene expression with hESCs 22 . Whole-transcriptome analysis confirmed that IMRCs clustered together 388
with UCMSCs in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering ( Fig. 2A) . Accordingly, MSC-specific genes 389 such as NT5E, ENG, PDGFRA, SPARC and ITGB1 were upregulated whereas pluripotency genes such 390 as POU5F1, SOX2, SALL4 and ZFP42 were extinguished in IMRCs, relative to hESCs, and the overall 391 correlation with hESCs was weak (R 2 =0.66, Fig. 2B ). Next, we analyzed for the expression of genes 392 specific to IMRCs, compared to UCMSCs (Fig. 2C) . While the overall correlation with UCMSCs was 393 stronger (R 2 =0.87), we also found that many genes were differentially expressed in IMRCs compared to 394
UCMSCs. The upregulated genes promote immunomodulation (LIF), tissue repair (VEGFA, GREM1), 395 cell division (CDC20) and anti-fibrosis (MMP1). By contrast, the downregulated genes predominantly 396 promote inflammation (IL-1B, CXCL8, CCL2 and CXCL1; Fig. 2C ). Gene set enrichment analysis 397 (GSEA) of the differentially expressed genes confirmed that IMRCs manifest reduced inflammation and 398 author/funder. All rights reserved.

To elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression amongst IMRCs, single cell RNA sequencing 401 (scRNAseq) was performed for both IMRCs and primary UCMSCs. Our scRNAseq data also showed 402 that IMRCs were relatively homogenous in expression for the MSC-specific markers PDGFRA, SPARC, 403 NT5E, ITGB1 and ENG. IMRCs were also relatively homogenous in their suppression of pluripotency 404 and non-mesenchymal markers, relative to hESCs and UCMSCs, suggesting they are likely to be similar 405 in biological activity to primary MSCs after transplantation (Fig. 2F) . These results provided insight into 406 the clinical applicability of IMRCs, especially with regards to their complete loss of pluripotency and 407 their gain in hyper-immunomodulatory potential. 408
To test the immunomodulatory capacity of IMRCs, we exposed them to the pro-inflammatory cytokine 410 IFN-γ. We found that after stimulation with IFN-γ, both primary UCMSCs and IMRCs displayed similar 411 characteristic morphological changes (Fig. 3A) . IFN-γ stimulation also potently upregulated IDO1 412 expression in both primary UCMSCs and IMRCs, but much more significantly so in IMRCs (Fig. 3B) . 413
This is important because IDO1 (indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1) has been shown to mediate 414 immunosuppression in T cell-inflamed microenvironments through its catabolism of tryptophan and thus 415 suppression of the tryptophan-kynurenine-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Trp-Kyn-AhR) pathway in T 416 cells. To further characterize IMRCs at a molecular level, we conducted genome-wide RNA profiling to 417 compare IMRCs with UCMSCs, after IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 3C) . Hierarchical clustering revealed that 418
IMRCs clustered separately from UCMSCs, although they appeared more similar after IFN-γ stimulation 419 (Fig. 3D) . To analyse IMRCs after IFN-γ stimulation in greater detail, we separated their differentially 420 expressed genes into different categories and tested their overlap using Venn diagram analysis (Fig. 3E) . 421
We found that some pro-inflammatory genes showed lower expression while some pro-regenerative 422 genes showed higher expression levels in IMRCs, compared to primary UCMSCs (Fig. 3F) . 423
To confirm these findings, we performed a focused ELISA analysis of 48 biologically relevant 424 chemokines and cytokines in the secretomes of both stimulated IMRCs and UCMSCs. We found that at 425 least nine pro-inflammatory cytokines were lower in IMRCs than UCMSCs, including interleukin-6 (IL-426 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Furthermore, while the anti-inflammatory IL-4 was lower, the immunomodulatory cytokines 428 IL-1RA, LIF, and RANTES were higher in IMRCs than UCMSCs (Fig. 3H) . Amongst the pro-429 regenerative cytokines, we found that GM-CSF was similar while VEGFA, MIG and SDF-1a were higher 430 in IMRCs than UCMSCs (Fig. 3I) . These results indicate that IMRCs manifest much stronger 431 immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative functions than UCMSCs. 432
Our scRNAseq results also indicated that more than 99% of IMRCs expressed MMP1 compared with 434 primary UCMSCs (<1%) (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR showed that IMRCs 435 express much higher levels of MMP1 than hESCs, UCMSCs or human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF; Fig.  436 4B). MMP1 could be detected as a highly secreted protein in the conditioned media of IMRCs by ELISA 437 (Fig. 4C ). In addition, the secreted MMP1 was an enzymatically active and correctly processed isoform 438 (Fig. 4D, E) . To investigate the role of the IMRCs on fibrosis, the human epithelial cell line A549 was 439 used to establish an in vitro fibrosis model. The morphology of A549 cells became myofibroblast-like 440 after 48h treatment with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 (Fig. 4F) . Consistent with the morphological changes, the 441 expression of myofibroblast markers such as ACTA2, Collagen I, Collagen II, Fibronectin and TGFB1 442 increased, while the expression of the epithelial identity marker CDH1 was extinguished, suggesting that 443 the A549 cells had undergone TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast transdifferentiation (Fig. 4G) . 444
Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses confirmed that TGF-β1 induced the upregulation of 445 collagen I and the downregulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 4H, I) . These results indicated that the A549 446 alveolar epithelial cells could simulate lung fibrosis in vitro. Thereafter, A549 cells were cultured with 447 or without the conditioned media of IMRCs, along with TGF-β1 treatment. Our results showed that the 448 IMRCs conditioned media significantly ameliorated the induction of Collagen I expression (Fig. 4J) . 449
Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses further confirmed that IMRCs conditioned media could 450 extinguish Collagen I protein expression during the A549-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (Fig. 4K,  451 L, M). These results suggested that IMRCs might be able to inhibit lung fibrosis. 452

Our single cell RNA sequencing showed 455 that no residual OCT4/SOX2/NANOG/TERT/DPPA5 + hESCs remained amongst the IMRCs, and that 456 all pluripotency gene expression had been extinguished (Fig. 5A) . To ensure their short-term and long-457 term safety, a series of biosafety-related experiments were performed according to the "Guidelines for Table S1 ). These biosafety-related 461 experiments included testing for bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, virus (by in vivo and in vitro methods), 462 pluripotent cell residuals, tumorigenicity and biopreparation safety (endotoxin and bovine serum albumin 463 residuals). According to these tests, the safety of the IMRCs has been verified as required by the National 464
To track the biodistribution and long-term engraftment of IMRCs in vivo, whole-animal imaging of mice 466 was performed at designated time points (day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, 27, 32, 37 and 46) after injection 467
with DiR-labeled IMRCs. Our data showed that DiR fluorescence intensity declined by half on the 5th 468 day, and dropped steadily over at least 15 days, disappearing around day 46 (Fig. 5B, C and Fig. S4C) . 469
No DiR fluorescence signals were observed in the control mouse. These results indicate that IMRCs 470 never show long-term engraftment in vivo. However, IMRCs were predominantly distributed to the lung, 471 with small amounts in the liver and spleen (Fig. S4B) . To assess the recruitment of IMRCs to the lung, 472 GFP-labeled IMRCs were used to track the distribution of IMRCs. A number of GFP-labeled IMRCs 473 were observed in the interstitial spaces in the lung, but not in the lung capillaries (Fig. 5D) . 474
Immunofluorescence analysis of the expression of the alveolar type II epithelial cell marker SPC and the 475 endothelial cell marker CD31 showed that neither marker was co-expressed with GFP-labeled IMRCs in 476 the lungs of mice by day 21 (Fig. 5D) . These data suggested that IMRCs are unlikely to engraft nor 477 transdifferentiate into endothelial or epithelial cells, after homing to the interstitium of lung tissues in 478
To give some indication of the tumorigenic potential of IMRCs in vitro, a soft agar assay was performed 480 (Fig. 5E) . As a positive control, the PANC-1 pancreas tumor cell line showed a colony formation rate of 481 about 30%. A small number of clones were also formed in hESCs, and the colony formation rate was 482 about 0.5%. However, no colonies were formed by IMRCs. These results indicated that IMRCs had no 483 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Somatic mutation analysis by whole genome 484 sequencing also showed zero mutations in all coding and noncoding exon regions of the IMRCs genome 485 (Fig. 5F ). Tumor formation assays also confirmed that IMRCs could not form any tumors in 486 immunodeficient mice after injection in vivo (Supplementary Table S1 ). 487
We also transfused different doses of IMRCs into cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), to 488 evaluate the short-and long-term toxicity of IMRCs in primates. After 6 months, acute toxicity data 489
showed that all blood biochemistry and urinalysis markers remained in the normal range (Fig. 5G, H) , 490
indicating normal liver, kidney, heart, muscular, pancreatic and overall metabolic functions. Moreover, 491 no abnormalities were observed in the long-term toxicity tests either (Fig. S5B, n=18) . These results 492 indicated that IMRCs have a robust safety profile in in vitro and in vivo animal models and could 493 potentially provide therapeutic treatments with good safety levels for clinical potential. 494
To evaluate the therapeutic effects of IMRCs on lung injury and fibrosis, IMRCs were administered 496 intravenously into a bleomycin-induced model of lung injury. IMRCs ameliorated the total body weight 497 reduction in mice exposed to bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.  498   6B ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that IMRC treatment prolonged the overall survival rates 499 (BLM group 12.5% vs. 1×10 6 IMRCs 25%, 3×10 6 IMRCs 50%, 5×10 6 IMRCs 62.5% (P＜0.01)) and 500 the median survival time (BLM group 11.5d vs. 1×10 6 IMRCs 15.5d, 3×10 6 IMRCs 18d, 5×10 6 IMRCs 501 21d) in mice exposed to bleomycin-induced lung injury. There was a statistically significant difference 502 between the BLM group and the 5×10 6 IMRCs group, but not the other groups (Fig. 6C) . Histological 503 staining of the lung at 21 days after bleomycin injection (inflammation phase) showed diffuse pneumonic 504 lesions with loss of the normal alveolar architecture, septal thickening, enlarged alveoli, and increased 505 infiltration of inflammatory cells in the interstitial and peribronchiolar areas, in the BLM lung compared 506 with normal lung. IMRC treatment reduced alveolar thickening in the lung in a dose-dependent manner 507 ( Fig. 6D-F) . Moreover, IMRC treatment reduced the number of macrophage in the lung (Fig. 6F) . These 508 results indicated that IMRC treatment can reduce inflammation in the lung after acute injury. Moreover, 509 IMRC treatment also improved the Ashcroft score for pulmonary fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner 510 (Fig. 6G) . In particularly, IMRC treatment decreased collagen deposition in the BLM lung in a dose-511 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The expression levels of COL I, FN and α-SMA were also significant lower 512 after IMRC treatment (Fig. S6) . ELISA showed that IMRC treatment reduced both TNF-α and TGF-β1 513 levels in the BLM lung in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6H, I) . These results suggested that IMRCs 514 can significantly reduce inflammation and fibrosis after lung injury, in a dose-dependent manner. 515
Pirfenidone (PFD) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It works 517 by reducing lung fibrosis through downregulating the production of growth factors and procollagens I 518 and II. To evaluate the efficacy of IMRC treatment, we compared it side-by-side with UCMSCs and PFD 519 treatments of BLM-injured mice (Fig. 6J) . Our results showed that IMRC treatment led to an improved 520 amelioration of the weight reduction after BLM-induced lung injury, compared to UCMSCs or PFD 521 treatments (Fig. 6K) . Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the IMRC treatments also resulted in 522 the highest overall survival rates compared to UCMSCs or PFD treatments ( Fig. 6L ; BLM group 39.02%, 523
vs. IMRCs 70% (P<0.01), UCMSCs 52.63%, PFD 65% (P＜0.05)). Moreover, IMRC treatment showed 524 the best improvement in lung morphology (Fig. S7A ) and the best reduction in BLM-induced edema, as 525 measured by the lung coefficient (lung wet weight/total body weight), compared to UCMSCs or PFD 526 treatments (Fig. S7B) . 527 528 Functionally, mice treated with IMRCs showed the best improvements in indices for lung capacity, 529 including pressure-volume (PV), inspiratory capacity (IC), static compliance (Crs) and forced vital 530 capacity (FVC) (Fig. S8A , B, C, D). IMRC treatment also showed the best reduction in functional indices 531 for lung fibrosis, including respiratory resistance (Rrs), elastic resistance (Ers), tissue damping (G) and 532 tissue elasticity (H) were observed (Fig. S8E, F, G, H) . Computed tomography (CT) scans also showed 533 that IMRC treatment led to the best improvement in lung morphology, compared to UCMSCs or PFD 534 treatment (Fig. S8I, J) . In fact, measurements of the lung volume indicated that mice treated with IMRCs 535 had the best improvement in lung volume compared to UCMSCs or PFD treatments. These results 536 indicated that the IMRC therapy is superior to primary UCMSCs and pirfenidone in treating lung injury 537 and fibrosis. 538

After patient consent, IMRCs were administered intravenously in both patients. Within 14 days after 541 IMRC transfusion, both the COVID-19 patients had significantly recovered from pneumonia, tested 542 negative for SARS-CoV-2, and were recommended for discharge. Cytokine analysis of both patients' 543 plasma showed very high levels of inflammatory cytokines initially in days 1-2, as expected of the induced cytokine storm that occurred at the point of treatment (Fig. 6M) . However, by days 4-8, many 545 pro-inflammatory cytokines were suppressed after IMRC infusion, including GRO-a, IFN-a2, IL-3, IL-546 9, IL-13, MCP-3, M-CSF, sCD40L and TNF-a (Fig. 6M) . These results confimed that IMRCs do 547 manifest a hyper-immunomodulatory function, with significant therapeutic benefits to ALI patients 548 without other treatment options. 549
In this study, IMRCs were derived from self-renewing hESC cultures with xeno-free reagents. Our results 551 showed that IMRCs, while similar to primary UCMSCs, were superior in their proliferative capacity, 552
hyper-immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic functions. In addition, the cell diameters of IMRCs were 553 generally smaller than UCMSCs, suggesting that they pose lower risks for pulmonary embolism after In recent years, MSC-like cells have been generated from hESCs using various protocols 18, 19, 34, 35 . 560
However, to the best of our knowledge and in spite of significant effort by numerous groups, previously 561 reported studies lacked biosafety-related experiments. This has hindered their translation to clinical 562 application. To ensure safety, a series of biosafety-related experiments were performed according to the 563 "Guidelines for Human Somatic Cell Therapies and Quality Control of Cell-based Products" and the 564 IMRCs were verified as suitable for use in human therapy. Our data showed that there was no teratoma 565 formation observed after IMRCs injection into the testes of NOD-SCID mice. In addition, single cell 566 RNA sequencing data showed no residual hESCs were detected in IMRCs and soft agar assays also 567 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In addition, the somatic mutation analysis by whole 568 genome sequencing also showed no mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, nor any 569 coding and non-coding exon regions of IMRCs. These results indicated that IMRCs have no 570 demonstrable potential to form tumors. Moreover, IMRCs could not undergo long-term engraftment and 571 disappeared around day 46. IMRCs did not transdifferentiate into endothelial cells nor alveolar epithelial 572 cells in the lung. To evaluate the risks of clinical application, short-and long-term toxicity tests were 573 performed in cynomolgus monkeys. After 6 months, both acute toxicity tests and long-term toxicity test 574 data showed that no abnormalities were observed. These results proved that IMRCs could have an 575 excellent safety profile and clinical potential. Moreover, the above data suggested that the therapeutic 576 efficacy of IMRCs may not be due to long-term engraftment and direct repair of tissue, but due to their 577 hyper-immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic functions at inflammatory sites of tissue interstitium. 578
Like MSCs, the IMRCs are immunoprivileged, and can escape the immune response through their lack 579 of expression of HLA class II and their weak expression of HLA class I, thus making them valuable 580 choices for allogeneic cell therapy. Moreover, it has been reported that MSCs could release 581 immunomodulatory factors, alter the expression of surface molecules, and produce growth factors during 582 an immune response to the inflammatory cytokines produced by T cells and antigen-presenting cells 36 . 583
These immunomodulatory factors are crucial for regulating the immune system and promoting tissue 584
repair. Accordingly, expression of the T cell-suppressive IDO1 greatly increased in IMRCs after 585 stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, even more than UCMSCs. Genome-wide RNA 586 sequencing revealed that IMRCs and UCMSCs had different expression profiles after exposure to IFN-587 γ. Analysis of the secretomes of IMRCs and UCMSCs confirmed at least nine pro-inflammatory 588 cytokines that were lower, and several anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-regenerative factors that 589 were higher in IMRCs than UCMSCs. All these results suggested that IMRCs possess a hyper-590 immunomodulatory capacity compared to primary UCMSCs, after stimulation with IFN-γ. Thus, these 591 cells can be administered to immunocompetent animals and human patients without the need for further 592 immunosuppression. 593
Moreover, higher levels of MMP1 were secreted by IMRCs than primary UCMSCs. MMP1 plays a very 594 important role in the process of fibrosis, by degrading existing collagens and promoting the early stages 595 of tissue remodeling that are critical for the progression of fibrogenesis 37,38 . In general, an imbalance 596 between MMPs and TIMPs is the direct cause of fibrosis and tissue scarring. It has been reported that 597 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, it is conceivable that IMRCs that highly 599 express MMP1 may also reverse lung fibrosis. Accordingly, our data showed that the secretome from 600
IMRCs could reduce collagen I levels during fibrogenesis induced by TGF-β1. However, it is still unclear 601 whether MMP1 played a direct role in the decrease of collagen I. Future work will focus on the role of 602 MMP1 by using MMP1-knockout IMRCs in vitro and in vivo. 603
The mouse BLM model is similar to human ALI/ARDS during the acute inflammatory phase. Although 604 fibroblastic foci, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells hyperplasia and honeycombing lesions are reduced 605 compared with those in humans, indicating that the reproduction of human ARDS is not complete in the 606 mouse BLM model, injury to alveolar epithelial cells has been shown to be a common contributing factor 607 to the pathogenesis of both human ARDS and BLM-induced mouse pulmonary injury 40,41 . To test the 608 therapeutic efficacy of IMRCs in the BLM mouse model, the delivery route and schedule of 609 administration (e.g. single dose versus repeated doses) was carefully considered. Intravenous infusion is 610 one of the principal delivery routes, considered to be minimally invasive, simple-to-use, and is the most 611 common mode for primary MSCs delivery in diverse lung disorders 42,43 . Furthermore, systemic 612 intravenous transplantation may be a suitable administration route in other future clinical scenarios. In 613 our present study, intravenous IMRCs improved the survival rate of mice with BLM-induced lung injury 614 in a dose-dependent manner, by inhibiting both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. As demonstrated 615 in vitro, IMRCs inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrosis cytokines, such 616 as TNF-α and TGF-β1, in lung tissue in vivo. Furthermore, lung function indicators such as PV, IC, Rrs, 617
Crs, Ers, Rn, G, H and FVC were improved compared with the BLM group. Furthermore, pilot tests of 618 IMRC transfusion in the clinic confirmed that IMRCs could rapidly suppress the inflammatory cytokine 619 storm in two COVID-19 patients within 4-8 days, and both severely ill patients were recommended for 620 discharge within 14 days after IMRC treatment. 621
It should be noted that IMRCs were administered at 1 and 7 days after initiation of BLM-injury, but 622 before fibrosis has fully developed. In fact several studies have reported that primary MSCs treatments 623 do not improve pathologically-established pulmonary fibrosis, while some studies suggest that primary 624
MSCs actually exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis 44 . Regarding the efficacy of IMRCs in established fibrosis, 625 further studies are necessary and our own investigation is still ongoing. It is unclear whether primary 626
MSCs do promote pulmonary fibrosis, but their lack of positive therapeutic effect may be due to 627 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
