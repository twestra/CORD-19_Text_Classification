Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, the world is being shaken to its core with numerous hospitalizations and prospected hundreds of thousands of deaths. In search for key targets of effective therapeutics, robust animal models mimicking COVID-19 in humans are urgently needed.
Here, we show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2. In wild-type hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. We further assess SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice.
Finally, we identify an exuberant innate response as key player in immune pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a double-edged role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Our results endorse hamsters as pre-clinical model to rationalize and assess the therapeutic benefit of new antivirals or immune modulators for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV) belongs to the family of Coronaviruses, which contains a large group of viruses that are constantly circulating in animals and humans. Illness in humans caused by coronaviruses is mostly mild and manifested by respiratory or digestive problems as leading symptoms 1 . However, some coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, have been responsible for serious outbreaks of severe and lethal respiratory disease 2, 3 . Unlike the previous outbreaks with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has undeniably evolved to the largest global health threat to humanity in this century.
The unprecedented scale and rapidity of the current pandemic urges the development of efficient vaccines, antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. A key step in expediting this process is to have animal models that recapitulate and allow to understand viral pathogenesis, and that can in particular be used to preclinically assess preventive and therapeutic countermeasures.
Acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory response in which a delayed type I interferon (IFN) response promotes the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients seems to result from a similar overshooting inflammatory response. However, because even non-human primates do not fully replicate COVID-19, little information and no appropriate animal models are currently available to address this hypothesis 7 .
To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type (WT) mice of different lineages (BALB/c and C57BL/6) and Syrian hamsters, as well as a panel of matched transgenic mouse and hamster strains with a knockout (KO) of key components of adaptive and innate immunity. We used an original patient isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020) that was passaged on HuH7 and Vero-E6 cells ( Fig. S1 and Fig. S2A ). For full characterization and to exclude possible contaminants, we performed deep sequencing on the inoculum that was used to infect the animals (Fig. S2A) . No adventitious agents could be detected (data not shown). However, two in-frame deletions in the N-terminal domain and the furin-cleavage site of Spike (S) glycoprotein (9aa and 5aa, respectively) had occurred between cell culture passage P4 and P6 [8] [9] [10] , likely as adaptation to growth in Vero-E6 cells in vitro (Fig. S2B ).
To first examine whether adaptive immunity contributed to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we inoculated WT (immune-competent) and SCID mice (lacking functional T and B cells) from the same BALB/c background intranasally with a high 2 × 10 5 TCID50 viral dose (P4 virus) (Fig.   1A ). On day 3 p.i., a viral RNA peak in the lungs was observed ( Fig. 1B and Fig. S3 ) with no obvious differences in viral loads (Fig. 1B) nor lung pathology ( Fig. 1D and Fig. S4A and S4B) between WT and SCID mice. These data indicate that mice that lack the human ACE2 receptor 11 , can in principle be infected with SARS-CoV-2, although inefficiently and likely transiently, as also observed for SARS-CoV-1 4,12 . However, adaptive immunity did not markedly contribute to this low susceptibility.
Interferons are prototypic first-line innate immune mechanisms on viral infections. To evaluate interferons, we compared viral RNA levels and lung pathology in WT C57BL/6 mice, and C57BL/6 mice with a genetic ablation of their type I (Ifnar1 -/-) and III interferon (IFN) receptors (Il28r -/-) (Fig.   1A ). Ifnar1 -/mice showed a slightly, but significantly enhanced replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung on day 3 p.i. compared to both WT and Il28r -/mice (Fig. 1C ). Similar to BALB/c mice, overall viral loads were low. Likewise, Ifnar1 -/mice that were treated with human convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patient serum (HCS) prior to infection (Fig. 1E ) had a one log10 reduction in viral loads, down to the residual input RNA levels observed in mice inoculated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1C ). This provides further evidence for active, although inefficient virus replication.
WT and knockout mouse strains, all on C57BL/6 background, presented consistently with only a mild lung pathology. However, Ifnar1 -/mice showed increased levels of intra-alveolar hemorrhage, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Passive transfer of HCS did not result in an obvious improvement in histopathological scores (Fig.   S4C ), in line with other studies about partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection 13, 14 and virusinduced inflammatory responses. Further evidence for true infection and hence viral replication is provided by transcriptomic analysis (Sharma, S. et al., in press 15 ) of infected lung tissues ( Fig. 1F and For many respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, type I and III interferon signaling has been described to play an important role in restricting infection 23 . No marked differences were observed in viral RNA levels in the lung of WT, STAT2 -/or IL28R-a -/hamsters (Fig. 2B) . However, STAT2 -/hamsters had higher titers of infectious virus in the lung (Fig. 2C) , high titer viremia 24 Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 levels, which may serve as a sensitive marker for the infiltration and activation of neutrophils in inflamed tissues 26, 27 , were markedly elevated in the lungs of all infected hamsters (Fig. 2G) . However, higher MMP-9 levels were found in STAT2 -/animals, thereby inversely correlating with the histological findings (Fig. 2D ). In addition, biomarkers elevated in critically ill COVID-19 patients 2,28,29 such as the cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and IFN- were not found to be markedly elevated in the serum of infected hamsters (Fig. S8B) . Nonetheless, infected STAT2 -/and IL28R-a -/had clearly increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in their lungs (Fig. S8A ). Such an inverse correlation between biomarkers and pathology in WT versus STAT2 -/hamsters is in line with findings in mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection in which pathology correlated with the induction and dysregulation of alternatively activated "wound-healing" monocytes/macrophages 4,6 .
The lack of readily accessible serum markers or the absence of overt disease symptoms in hamsters prompted us to establish a non-invasive means to score for lung infection and SARS-CoV-2 induced lung disease by computed tomography (CT) as used in standard patient care to aid COVID-19 diagnosis with high sensitivity and monitor progression/recovery [28] [29] [30] [31] . Similar as in humans 32 , semiquantitative lung pathology scores were obtained from high-resolution chest micro-CT scans of freebreathing animals 33 signaling drive lung pathology, yet has minor impact on viral replication in the lungs (Fig. 3E ).
Together, these data fully support micro-CT as a convenient adjunct to histological scoring ( Fig. 2D and Fig. S9D ) to visualize and quantify SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in the hamster model.
Moreover, it may allow to monitor the impact of therapeutic measures non-invasively during disease progression.

The increase in replication of SARS-CoV-2 seen in IL28R-a -/hamsters, on one hand, combined with a tempered inflammatory response and lung injury as compared to WT hamsters, on the other hand, is in line with the role of type III IFN plays during respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-1 44 . This observation also suggests that in humans pegylated IFN-lambda 45, 46 (or similar modulators of (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

In conclusion, hamsters may be a preferred above mice as infection model for the preclinical assessment of antiviral therapies, of convalescent serum transfer and of approaches that aim at tempering the COVID-19 immune pathogenesis in critically ill patients 48, 49 . The latter may be achieved by repurposing anti-inflammatory drugs such as IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. Tocilizumab) 50 , or small molecule Jak/STAT inhibitors (e.g. Ruxolitinib or Tofacitinib). Educated by our finding that STAT2 signaling plays a dual role in also limiting viral dissemination, targeting the virus-induced cytokine response and overshooting of macrophage activation may need to be complemented by (directly acting) antivirals 51 .
Wild-type Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were purchased from Janvier Laboratories. All other mouse (C57BL/6, Ifnar1 -/-, Il28r -/-, BALB/c and SCID) and hamster (STAT2 -/and IL28R-a -/-) strains were bred in-house. Six-to eight-weeks-old female mice and wild-type hamsters were used throughout the study. Knock-out hamsters were used upon availability; seven-to twelve-week old female STAT2 -/hamsters; five-to seven-week-old IL28R-a -/hamsters. solution. Each animal was inoculated intranasally by gently adding 50µl droplets of virus stock containing 2 × 10 5 TCID50 (P4 virus) or 2 × 10 6 TCID50 (P6 virus) on both nostrils.
Vero-E6 (African green monkey kidney) and HuH7 (human hepatoma) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Integro), 1% bicarbonate (Gibco), and 1% L-glutamine (Gibco). All assays involving virus growth were performed using 2% fetal bovine serum instead of 10%.
SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 (EPI ISL 407976|2020-02-03) recovered from a nasopharyngeal swab taken from a RT-qPCR-confirmed asymptomatic patient returning from Wuhan, China beginning of February 2020 53 was directly sequenced on a MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore) as described previously 54 
Animals were euthanized at different time-points post-infection, organs were removed and lungs were homogenized manually using a pestle and a 12-fold excess of cell culture medium (DMEM/2%FCS).
RNA extraction was performed from homogenate of 4 mg of lung tissue with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), or 50µl of serum using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other organs were collected in RNALater (Qiagen) and homogenized in a bead mill (Precellys) prior to extraction. Of 100µl eluate, 4µl was used as template in RT-qPCR reactions. RT-qPCR was performed on a LightCycler96 platform (Roche) using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step RT-qPCR kit (BioRad) with primers and probes (Table S1 ) specific for SARS-CoV-2, mouse β-actin and hamster β-actin (IDT). For each data point, qPCR reactions were carried out in duplicate.

The mean of housekeeping gene β-actin was used for normalization. The relative fold change was calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method 57 .
After extensive transcardial perfusion with PBS, lungs were collected, extensively homogenized using manual disruption (Precellys24) in minimal essential medium (5% w/v) and centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 10min, 4°C) to pellet the cell debris. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were quantified by means of endpoint titrations on confluent Vero-E6 cell cultures. Viral titers were calculated by the Spearman-Kärber method and expressed as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per 100mg tissue.
To study differential gene expression, RNA was extracted from lung tissues using Triazol, subjected to cDNA synthesis (High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and qPCR using a custom Taqman qRT-PCR array (Thermo Fisher Scientific) of 30 genes known to be activated in response to virus infection 15 , as well as two housekeeping genes (Table S2) 
For histological examination, the lungs were fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (4 µm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize and score for lung damage.
Cytokine levels in lung homogenates and serum of hamsters were determined by ELISA for IFN- (EHA0005), IL-6 (EHA0008) and IL-10 (EHA0006) following the manufacturer's instructions (Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd).
The levels of gelatinase B/metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 present in lung homogenates were analyzed using gelatin zymography 59 , essentially as described previously 60 . For quantification of zymolytic bands internal control samples were spiked into each sample. Equivalent hamster enzyme (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

and recombinant human pro-MMP-9ΔOGHem as standards 61 .
Hamsters were anaesthetized using isoflurane (Iso-Vet) (2-3% in oxygen) and installed in prone position into the X-cube micro-CT scanner (Molecubes) using a dedicated imaging bed. Respiration was monitored throughout. A scout view was acquired and the lung was selected for a non-gated, helical CT acquisition using the High-Resolution CT protocol, with the following parameters: 50kVp, 960 exposures, 32 ms/projection, 350 µA tube current, rotation time 120 s. Data were reconstructed using a regularized statistical (iterative) image reconstruction algorithm using non-negative least squares 62 , using an isotropic 100 µm voxel size and scaled to Hounsfield Units (HUs) after calibration against a standard air/water phantom. The spatial resolution of the reconstruction was estimated at 200µm by minimizing the mean squared error between the 3D reconstruction of the densest rod in a micro-CT multiple density rod phantom (Smart Scientific) summed in the axial direction and a digital phantom consisting of a 2D disk of 17.5mm radius that was post-smoothed with Gaussian kernels using different full width half maxima (FWHM), after aligning the symmetry axis of the rod to the zaxis.
Visualization and quantification of reconstructed micro-CT data was performed with DataViewer and CTan software (Bruker micro-CT). As primary outcome parameter, a semi-quantitative scoring of micro-CT data was performed as previously described 33, 34, 63 with minor modifications towards optimization for COVID-19 lung disease in hamsters. In brief, visual observations were scored (from 0 -2 depending on severity, both for parenchymal and airway disease) on 5 different, predefined transversal tomographic sections throughout the entire lung image for both lung and airway disease by two independent observers (L.S. and G.V.V.) and averaged. Scores for the 5 sections were summed up to obtain a score from 0 to 10 reflecting severity of lung and airway abnormalities compared to scans of healthy, WT control hamsters. As secondary measures, image-derived biomarkers (nonaerated lung volume, aerated lung volume, total lung volume, the respective densities within these volumes and large airways volume) were quantified as in 33, 63 for a manually delineated VOI in the lung, avoiding the heart and main blood vessels. The threshold used to separate the airways and aerated (0-55) from non-aerated lung volume (56-255) was set manually on a 8-bit greyscale histogram and kept constant for all data sets.
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical evaluations. The number of animals and independent experiments that were performed is indicated in the legends to figures.
Statistical significance was determined using the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test. Values were considered significantly different at P values of ≤0.05.
