COVID-19 is quickly spreading around the world and carries along 9 with it a significant threat to public health. This study sought to apply 10 meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduc-11 tion number (R 0 ) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the 12 isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capa-13 bility to care for patients. Prior estimates of R 0 have varied widely and 14 range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined 15 a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R 0 , which is substantially larger than 16 that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized 17 to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine 18 whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this 19 standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current 20 infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Fi-21 nally, we utilize our robust estimate of R 0 and the standardized infectious 22 rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced 23 by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling 24 the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted 25 early in Italy and the United States.

reached a buffer period by using early and aggressive quarantine measures, Most 75 of Europe is currently at its peak period, and the US remains in a period of 76 exponential case growth which may be due to late, inconsistent, and relatively 77 permissive isolation measures enacted by states in absence of an early unified 78 federal response. 79 The number of people who are infected during the peak period depends mainly 80 on the efficacy of quarantine in the absence of a vaccine. So the quarantine has 81 been carried out to decrease the effective reproduction number of COVID-19. 82 From the term of epidemic principles, the virus usually has the initial basic trans-83 missibility R 0 . R 0 is an important index to determine the epidemic intensity. So 84 many studies have been carried out to estimate it as we describe in detail below. 85 As the efficacy of quarantine increases, the reproductive number decrease. If the 86 declining trend continues with the assumption of no resurges of the epidemic, 87 the reproduction number will drop below one, meaning that each individual will, We introduce the related statistical models to solve the question in COVID-19 research in this section.

So, we assumed that the number of infected patients is related to the total population, the effective reproduction number index, and the government isolation policy to stop the rapidly transmitted from person to person. Now let Y t denote the number of infectious patients in a specific country, and the model for the number of the COVID-19 cases is assumed to be dependent on the total population, the reproduction number index, and the government isolation policy as follows:
where R t denotes the effective reproduction index at time t, P denotes the total 111 population in the specific country, and X denotes the local government such as 112 a balance between the freedom and permissiveness. The function F can be a 113 suitable predict function with these variables P , R t , and X. For the function F , 114 the paper liu2020 used functional mixed effect model to Y t . We do not focus on 115 the construction of the function F in this paper.
The basic reproductive number R 0 is an important pandemic index to indi-117 cate infectious intensity, but it is challenging to determine the true value. Many 118 studies have given a wide range of R 0 in the existing literature, and we propose 119 the meta-analysis to estimate it in Section 2.1. Usually, the higher the reproduc-120 tion number, the more people will be infected given no intervention. We proposed 121 to use the infectious rate per million population from Y t and P to see the pan-122 demic severity in Section 2.2. Also, this standardized infectious rate per million 123 population also allows us to compare the intervention effects of COVID-19 across 124 countries. If the infectious rate exceeds the maximum healthcare capacity, the 125 pandemic will cause a high mortality rate. Therefore, we discuss the relationship 126 between the healthcare capacity and the peak of the infectious rate in Section 3. The estimated values of R 0 were different from each other with the range was 138 from 1.95 to 6.49. This huge difference of R 0 motivated us to estimate the basic 139 All rights reserved.

Meta-analysis can be used to address the same question in multiple scientific 142 studies, where each individual study reporting measurement was expected to have 143 some degree of error. So our main aim is to use the meta-analysis approach to 144 derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth. A benefit of 145 this approach was allowing us to have the aggregation of information leading to 146 a higher statistical power and a more robust point estimate than that is possible 147 from the measure derived from any individual study. Therefore, we have selected 148 13 independent studies to estimate R 0 by meta-analysis in the paper. In these 149 selected studies, these studies collected a random sample from a larger popula- 
where µ j ∼ N (0, τ 2 ) and j ∼ N (0, σ 2 j ). The parameter τ 2 represents the 156 between-study variability and is often referred to as the heterogeneity parameter.
It estimates the variability among the studies, beyond the sampling variability.
Therefore, the target of inference is R 0
. We use the weighted 159 average as the estimator for R 0 pop as follows:

Therefore, the change curve of the standardized infectious rate over time can 170 indicate the effectiveness of the isolation policy executed by the government.
By standardizing the reproduction rate to per million population, we can more 172 feasibly compare the effect of the government closure policy across countries since 173 it allows the reader to see both the number of the total population and the number 174 of cases in a single measure. Additionally, since the health system capacity is 175 proportional to the total population, the reproduction rate per million population 176 is more likely to predict whether the health capacity in a specific country has been 177 exceeded, which is important to know because this can lead to an unnecessary 178 increase in morbidity and mortality.
