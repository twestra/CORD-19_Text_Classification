Coronavirus disease 2019 , first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, 6 4 patients with severe conditions and worked there for 35 days. HCWs were called from 1 3 2 multiple clinical departments, including ICU, infectious disease department, and other 1 3 3 departments, because of the need of multidisciplinary care for COVID-19 patients with 1 3 4 multiple organ infections and/or comorbid chronic diseases, such as hypertension, 1 3 5 coronary heart disease, diabetes and malignant tumors. When treating COVID-19 patients, 1 3 6 these HCWs were equipped with appropriate and adequate PPE including protective 1 3 7 clothing, masks, gloves, goggles and face shields. After the COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1 3 8 controlled, they returned to Hefei on March 18, 2020 and were quarantined for 14 days. Throat swab samples and blood samples were collected on March 25, 2020, which was 1 4 0 during the quarantine period. All HCWs in this group were released from quarantine on 1 4 1 April 1, 2020.

Only about a quarter of these HCWs were from ICU, 1 9 4 infectious disease, respiratory medicine, emergency, anesthesiology departments, and the 1 9 5 majority was from other departments who had relatively less experience in dealing with 1 9 6 infectious diseases. Surprisingly, among them, both the nucleic acid tests and serological 1 9 7 antibody tests showed that none of these HCWs was infected with SARS-CoV-2. The test 1 9 8 of serological antibodies included IgA, IgM and IgG, which ruled out the possibility of 1 9 9 asymptomatic infection.

We also performed the nucleic acid tests and serological antibody tests on 284 period from January 23 to February 1, the daily demand of PPE was on average 100,000 2 0 9 sets per day, while China's domestic average capacity of production was less than 10,000 2 1 0 sets per day. During that period, PPE supply was heavily dependent on overseas imports 2 1 1 and donations except domestic production. With the continuing increase in domestic 2 1 2 production of PPE in China, the PPE supply started to meet and then exceed the demand. China's daily production capacity reached 48,500 sets. Together with overseas imports 2 1 5 and donations, the demand and supply were tightly balanced at that time. After March 6, 2 1 6 2020, daily production of PPE in China reached 500,000 sets, exceeding the daily 2 1 7 demand (Figure 1 ).
The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections among HCWs in China increased 2 1 9 since the outbreak in December 2019, peaked on January 28, 2020, and then dropped 2 2 0 gradually thereafter (Figure 2) . As a strategy to provide sufficient HCWs to deal with the 2 2 1 drastically increased number of COVID-19 patients and to compensate the reduced 2 2 2 number of available HCWs in Hubei province due to COVID-19 infection and quarantine, 2 2 3 All rights reserved.

As of April 16, 2020, none of the 2 2 5 42,600 HCWs was reported to have COVID-19 infection (Figure 3 ). This molecular epidemiological study of two groups of HCWs confirmed that HCWs who were dispatched to work in Wuhan and those who remained in Hefei were Our analysis of national and regional PPE availability suggested a potential 2 3 9 association between PPE use and reduction in COVID-19 infections among HCWs. HCWs in Hubei province accounted for over 90% of the cases among HCWs nationwide.

Subsequently, with nationwide efforts to promote domestic production, the supply of PPE 2 4 7 was gradually meeting the demand since early February 2020, which is in parallel with 2 4 8 the decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs. Since early March, the 2 4 9 emergency state has been reversed to a surplus status. Coincidently, the rapid increase of An important measure to protect the HCWs to be dispatched to Hubei province supply were taken from other provinces which dispatched HCWs to Hubei province. The It is noteworthy that not all the HCWs that were dispatched to Hubei province had 2 6 4 expertise in infectious disease or respiratory disease. In the present study, the majority of HCWs that were dispatched from Hefei to work in Wuhan were from departments other 2 6 6 than ICU, infectious diseases, or respiratory diseases. Although these HCWs were 2 6 7 provided adequate PPE, they had limited experience dealing with infectious agents in 2 6 8 their previous clinical work.

patients of COVID-19 could cause infections among some HCWs. However, even among 2 7 0 them, no one was infected with SARS-CoV-2, which further strengthened the importance 2 7 1 of adequate PPE supply and use for HCWs.
Our findings about a potential relation between PPE use and successful protection outbreak in Wuhan and throughout China has been successfully controlled, with the 2 9 0 lockdown of Wuhan and a series of multifaceted interventions. 11 However, emerging 2 9 1 epicenters around the world, such as Italy, 24 Spain, and the United States, 9 are currently 2 9 2 All rights reserved.

COVID-19 in this study offers a promising message to the HCWs that their risk might be 2 9 6 greatly reduced or even eliminated with appropriate and adequate PPE use. This study has several limitations. First, like other observational studies, the 2 9 8 present study could not establish causality between PPE use and the successful In conclusion, our laboratory-confirmed findings of zero infection indicate that Therefore, it is critical and urgent to ensure sufficient PPE in health care workplace to All rights reserved.
