2 ABSTRACT 24 Background 25 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal 26 (NP) swabs required for testing. We participated in an unprecedentedly open and urgent 27 iterative process to help develop and validate new swabs. 28 Methods 29 We tested prototypes for material suitability, collection sufficiency, PCR compatibility, and the 30 likelihood that they could be mass-produced, individually packaged, and sterilized quickly. 31 Suitable prototypes were selected for an ongoing IRB-approved clinical trial. Participants were 32 outpatients suspected of COVID-19 who presented to our drive-through test station. Each 33 participant was swabbed with a control swab followed by a prototype swab. For each prototype, 34 at least 10 control-swab positive and 10 control-swab negative PCR results were collected. We 35 measured concordance using Cohen's kappa, compared Ct values by Mann-Whitney U, and 36 assessed staff preferences via written survey. 37 Results 38 We evaluated 45 materials and 150 designs from 23 individuals, laboratories, and companies. 39 We have selected four so far for the clinical trial. Three have completed testing. For these, we CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs provide the highest sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-56 2 infection during early infection using commercial reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 57 reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays. An NP swab is an FDA Class I exempt medical device 58 roughly 15 cm in length and 2-3mm in diameter designed to reach the posterior nasopharynx 59 (Fig. 1a, b) . It generally consists of a shaft, a neck, and a head coated with flock (short synthetic 60 filaments). The swab is inserted into the nasopharynx, rotated to collect material, and placed 61 into a vial containing viral transport media (VTM). A breakpoint on the shaft enables detachment 62 and release of the head into the vial, which is then sealed and sent for testing. 63 The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in severe shortages of diagnostic testing 64 supplies, including NP swabs, due to both manufacturing stoppages resulting in decreased 65 supply and pandemic spread resulting in unprecedented demand 2 . To address the swab 66 shortage, hospitals and other testing centers have repurposed other commercially available 67 swabs (e.g. throat, urogenital) to collect nasal epithelial mucosa for testing. However, these 68 swabs are suboptimal for swabbing the nasopharynx due to differences in size and flexibility 69 and the possibility they contain PCR-inhibitory materials 3, 4 . 70 In the short term, one solution is to design and 3D-print swabs. Advantages include simplicity 71 over the multistep process of applying flock, the widespread availability of 3D printing capacity, 72 and the ability to iterate prototypes rapidly 5 . To resolve the swab-shortage crisis, we have been 73 participating in an open collaborative process that has brought together many medical centers, 74 individuals, academic laboratories, and both new and well established manufacturers 6 . As part 75 of this process, we have been testing and continuously providing feedback on prototype swabs 76 in order to proceed rapidly but safely toward the development of swabs that can be used 77 clinically, at volumes sufficient to address the need. The openness of the process was a 78 conscious decision supported by a substantial body of scientific literature, including the previous 79 experience of the present authors, that demonstrates advantages relative to closed or more 80 siloed approaches 7-9 . At our institution, this process has led to an ongoing clinical trial of several 81 prototype swabs, the first results of which we report here.
Preclinical evaluation (Phase I) 84 Design. An infectious disease physician, clinical microbiologist, and respiratory therapist tested 85 each prototype swab for design and mechanical properties (Fig. 1c, d) . This included size

We tested for the ability to collect sufficient material for testing using 98 Gram stain of a swab of the interior cheek smeared onto a standard microscopy slide as a 99 surrogate for NP swabbing and comparison to Gram stain of material obtained from Copan 100 Diagnostics, Inc. (Mantua, Italy) model 501CS01 as the control (Fig. 1c) . Slides were heat fixed 101 and Gram stained according to the BD BBL gram stain test kit protocol 10 Production considerations (Phase II) 115 We considered stability to autoclaving by repeating Phase I testing on post-autoclaved 116 materials; manufacturers' short-term strategies for individual packaging; and manufacturers' 117 stated ability to produce at least 10,000 swabs per day within a week's notice. We considered 118 differences in supply chain to minimize the risk of future crises. 119 IRB and field testing (Phase III) 120 Trial design and oversight. COVIDSwab is an adaptive trial for evaluating the performance of 121 prototype NP swabs ("prototypes") as compared to Copan model 501CS01 ("control").

RT-PCR results are reported categorically as either positive or negative. 144 We tested categorical concordance using Cohen's kappa 14 hours (quality-control data independent of our study). This tested the null hypothesis that the 156 differences between control and prototype swabs and the differences between two control 157 swabs are drawn from the same underlying distribution; p>0.05 is interpreted as no bias. 158 To quantify relative preferences among the prototypes, we gave study staff members printouts 159 of all six possible pairs of swabs ("round robin"), in randomized order, and for each pair asked CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The materials were FDA-grade plastics and resins (e.g. Keysplint Soft). Head design 186 evolved over several iterations to increase surface area. Designs generally featured a polygonal 187 matrix connected to a central, tapered strut with multiple branch points (Fig. 1b) . By varying the 188 polygon size, manufacturers were able to balance sample collection (Fig. 1c) , stiffness, and 189 surface texture. Variations of a longitudinal central strut allowed for varying degrees of flexibility 190 and impact cushioning (Fig. 1d) . 1-3; Fig. 2b ). 226 Staff and participant preferences. A written staff survey showed a preference for Prototypes 2 227 and 3 over Prototype 1, and a preference for the control swab over all three prototypes (Fig. 3a) . 228 In narrative feedback, Prototype 1 was described as less comfortable to participants than the 229 others; Prototypes 2 and 3 were described as being more comparable to the control (Fig. 3b) .

And fourth, we note the utility of our "round-robin" A-B testing survey to summarize preferences, 255 although the narrative comments seemed often to be more positive the round robin suggested; 256 a possible explanation is simply study staff's familiarity with the control swab. 257 Like the control swab, the prototype swabs we tested can be improved upon, and manufacturers 258 are currently doing so. The same is true for other prototypes we may test through our ongoing 259 trial. Especially in a crisis, perfect is the enemy of good enough. We hope our experience will 260 provide a useful case study for how to iterate and produce a clinically validated medical 261 manufacture under the pressure of an ongoing pandemic, work on which others will hopefully 262 improve as we continue to fight COVID-19 together. As the saying goes, 17 it is amazing what 263 can be accomplished when you do not care who gets the credit.
