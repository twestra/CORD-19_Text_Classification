Introduction
Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recent 51 pandemic and declared as a public health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO) 1 . 52 The disease rapidly spread across the globe and caused havoc to humanity 2 . By the end of 53 March, SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 200 countries and infected over 4,50,000 people 3 . The 54 WHO is continuously monitoring and updating the health-related plans to curtail the disease 55 spread. The absence of specific treatment and vaccine worsen the situation and threat the world. 56 International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), classified SARS-CoV-2 57 under family coronaviridae of order nidovirales. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 58 isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient from the Wuhan, China showed a 59 length of 29,903 nucleotides (GenBank accession number NC_045512) 4 . The SARS-CoV-2 60 contains a positive single-stranded RNA with 5ˊ and 3ˊ UTR. The genome codes for ORF1a, 61 ORF1b, Spike (S), ORF3a, ORF3b, Envelope (E), Membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, 62
ORF8, ORF9b, ORF14, Nucleocapsid (N), and ORF10 from 5ˊ to 3ˊ 4,5 .
The S glycoprotein forms homotrimers and represents a potential target for therapeutic 64 and vaccine design as it mediates viral entry into host cells 6,7 . S glycoprotein comprises of two 65 functional subunits. Whereas the S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, 66 the S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion of the viral with the cell membrane. Usually, in 67 CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non-68 covalently bound in the prefusion conformation, to activate the protein for membrane fusion 69 via extensive irreversible conformational changes 8-10 . Setting apart from other SARS-CoVs, it 70 is found that S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary 71 between the S1/S2 subunits 11 . By now, it is evident that SARS-CoV-2 S uses angiotensin-72 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-mediated entry into cells. It is found that the receptor-73 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The 94 average solvent accessibility (ASA) profile was predicted for each sequence using SABLE 95 server 15 . BepiPred 1.0 Linear Epitope Prediction module 16-18 incorporated in Immune Epitope 96 Database (IEDB) 19 was used to predict potential epitopes within the S protein. The FASTA 97 sequence of the targeted protein was used as an input for all the default parameters.
Identification of B-cell epitopes 99 We used two web-based tools for B-cell epitope prediction, viz., the IEDB, and 100 ABCpred server 20 . S protein structure from protein data bank (PDB) (6VSB) 21 was analyzed 101 for linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes using ElliPro module 22 on IEDB server, with 102 default settings. Also, ABCpred server was used to detect B-cell epitopes using artificial neural 103 network (ann) method. 104 Identification of T-cell epitopes 105 T-cell epitopes having binding affinity towards MHC-I and MHC-II alleles were 106 selected to boost up both cytotoxic T-cell and helper T-cell mediated immune response. IEDB 107 server was used to predict the MHC-I and MHC-II binding epitopes for targeted protein. The 108 reference set of alleles was used for predicting the MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes. 23-27 109 110 Results and Discussion 111 In our study, we targeted the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as it is present outside the 112 virus and interacts with the host receptor. At the time of the study, there were 98 sequences 113 available for the targeted protein of SARS-CoV-2. The S glycoprotein is 1273 amino acids 114 long sequence except for the virus isolated from Kerala (India), which is 1272 amino acids 115 long spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession number MT012098). Our interest here was to 116
determine conserved regions first and then determine surface-exposed regions, which are 117 potential epitopes to generate immune response. We found that sequences among all the S 118 proteins in the analysis are least variable and highly conserved as shown in Figure 1 . Regions 119 having a high value of ASA are more surface exposed as compared to others. We identified a 120 total of 24 peptides of varying length, as shown in Table 1 , which are selected based on high 121 ASA values. The potential epitope regions were predicted using the sequence of S protein of 122 SARS-CoV-2, which showed the least variability (GenBank accession number NC_045512).
The 2019 novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak 25 has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide. The present 26 study followed computational approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for spike 27 glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with the human leukocyte antigen alleles. We 28 identified twenty-four peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are well 29 conserved among the reported strains. The S protein structure further validated the presence of 30 predicted peptides on the surface. Out of which twenty are surface exposed and predicted to 31 have reasonable epitope binding efficiency. The work could be useful for understanding the 32 immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in 33 designing some peptide-based diagnostics. binding domains of S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind with similar affinities to 74 human ACE2 11,12 . 75 As the situation worsens, there is a growing need for the development of suitable 76 therapeutics and alternate diagnostics against SARS-CoV-2 for effective disease management 77 strategies. Diagnostic assays based on peptides have become increasingly substantial and 78 indispensable for its advantages over conventional methods 13 . The present study aimed to 79 locate appropriate epitopes within a particular protein antigen, which can elicit an immune 80 response that could be selected for the synthesis of the immunogenic peptide. Using 81 computational approach, S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was explored to identify various 82 immunodominant epitopes for the development of diagnostics. Besides, the results could also 83 help us to understand the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein response towards T and B cells. To identify an immunodominant region, it is of extreme importance to select the 92 conserved region within the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. All the sequences were compared 6 The potential epitopes are represented by blue peaks, while green-colored slopes represent non-124 epitopic regions (Figure 2 ).
The existence of B-cell linear and discontinuous (conformational) epitopes within the 126 identified segments could help us to identify the peptides, which can elicit immune response 127 28 . We identified 18 linear epitopes, predicted by ElliPro (IEDB), which contains regions from 128 19 of our selected peptides highlighted in red in Table 2 . These identified B-cell linear epitopes 129 are placed based on their positional value, and scores. Epitopes with high scores have more 130 potential for antibody binding. Five of our selected peptides (peptide numbers 3, 5, 19, 23, and 131 24 in Table 1) were not considered as potential linear B-cell epitopes.
Using the same module, B-cell discontinuous epitopes were predicted, which gave 16 133 epitope regions that contained regions from 18 of our selected peptides highlighted in red 134 (Table 3) . Six peptides (peptide numbers 3, 5, 14, 19, 23, and 24 in Table 1 ) were not predicted 135 as discontinuous B-cell epitopes. To further confirm, we used ABCpred server to detect B-cell 136 epitopes, with default threshold of 0.51. It identified various epitopes with different length and 137 scores; out of those, the regions which contained our selected peptides are highlighted in red 138 (Table 4) . A high score represents a good binding affinity with epitopes, and most of our 139 peptides scored more than 0.7 and were predicted as linear B-cell epitopes. 140 We used the IEDB server to determine the binding affinity for human leucocyte antigen 141 7 epitope(s) with high binding affinity with HLA-A and HLA-B alleles, except one. Similarly, 149 the list of binding affinities for MHC-II T-cell epitopes are given in Table 6 . Regions from our 150 selected peptides are highlighted in red. The results revealed that around half of our selected 151 peptides are potential T-cell epitope(s) with high binding affinity with HLA-DRB and HLA-152 DP/DQ alleles.
Overall, it was found that the regions identified in Table 1 not only had good B-cell and 154 T-cell affinities, but the majority of them had overlaps with discontinuous epitopes also (Table   155 3). The peptide segments identified from the set of 98 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 S 156 glycoprotein appear to hold reasonable potential to act as immunogens. Peptide-based success 36 . In our study, we predicted both B-cell and T-cell epitopes for conferring immunity 172 in different ways. We speculate that the identified epitopes with considerably good epitope 173 author/funder.
