cases is critical to support efforts to contain or reduce spread of viral infection in the community. Here we detected a significant association between domestic travel or travel to Europe and the identification of new cases in San Francisco, California, USA.
These findings suggest that domestic and European travelers may need to be prioritized for evaluation of acute infection from COVID-19 in the setting of limited testing capacity.
As of April 4 th , 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus 1 has infected more than 1.2 million people worldwide and the rise in cases has been exponential. In particular, New York cases in the United States surged from 22 to more than 113,000 between March 10 and now 2 , threatening to overwhelm hospitals and other regional health care systems in the city.

No significant associations were found with regards to close contacts with known COVID-19 infected persons or frontline healthcare workers. Of note was one cluster of 3 positive cases associated with COVID-19 infection in an airport worker, that was categorized as a case of community rather than travel-associated transmission.
