Activating mutations in LRRK2 kinase cause Parkinson's disease. Pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases and blocks ciliogenesis. Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10-and Myosin Vadependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.
Activating mutations in the LRRK2 kinase cause Parkinson's disease (Alessi & Sammler, 2018) . Recent work has shown that pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, including Rabs 8,10,12 and 35 (Steger et al, 2017, 2016) that are master regulators of membrane trafficking events (Pfeffer, 2017) . A significant consequence of LRRK2 Rab phosphorylation is a decrease in primary cilia in a variety of cell types, including in mouse brain (Steger et al, 2017; Dhekne et al, 2018; Lara Ordónez et al, 2019) .
We have been studying the effect of Rab phosphorylation on ciliogenesis and report here our progress in understanding the consequences of pRab10-RILPL2 complex formation. To our surprise we find that the MyoVa globular tail domain also contains a binding site for LRRK2phosphorylated Rab10, and LRRK2 kinase activity and pRab10 drive MyoVa and RILPL2 to the mother centriole during ciliogenesis blockade, perhaps entrapping MyoVa at that location.
RILPL2 associates with primary cilia in IMCD3 cells (Schaub & Stearns, 2013) . We determined the localization of RILPL2 in primary astrocytes that were isolated using antibody immuno-panning from brains of newborn rats (Foo et al, 2011) . Most of these astrocytes contain Arl13b + primary cilia, and endogenous RILPL2 was detected at low levels throughout the cytoplasm and also at the base of these cilia (Fig. 1A) . Cultured cell lines including hTERT-RPE cells yielded only weak endogenous RILPL2 staining, however upon exogenous expression, HA-RILPL2 displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization (see below). After 2 hours of serum starvation to induce primary cilia formation, a small amount of HA-RILPL2 was detected adjacent to the mother centriole, identified by distal appendage protein CEP164, centriolar cap protein CP110 or the ciliary vesicle marker, EHD1 (Fig. 1B) ; partial RILPL2 re-localization upon serum withdrawal was observed in >50% of the transfected cells ( Fig. 1C) .

As mentioned earlier, RILPL2 binds MyoVa. Most MyoVa is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (see below) but a small amount of total cellular MyoVa associates with primary cilia (Kohli et al, 2017) and regulates ciliogenesis (Assis et al, 2017) . Wu et al (2018) reported that MyoVa mediates transport of preciliary vesicles from the peri-centrosomal region to the distal appendages of the mother centriole. To explore the possible contribution of MyoVa to centriolar RILPL2 localization, we depleted MyoVa using siRNA and then monitored the localization of exogenously expressed B) . To our surprise, RILPL2 localized to the mother centriole in >50% of MyoVa-depleted cells, even under non-ciliating conditions, compared with ~15% of control siRNA-transfected cells (Figs. 2C, D) . These data indicate that MyoVa transports RILPL2 away from the centriolar region under non-ciliating conditions. Note that both N-terminally HA-and GFP-tagged RILPL2 were detected at the centriole upon serum starvation (Figs. 1B, D) or MyoVa depletion (Fig. 2D) , however less C-terminally tagged RILPL2-GFP localized to the centriolar region in parallel experiments, suggesting a .

Like RILPL2, the related RILPL1 also binds preferentially to phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 (Steger et al, 2017; Waschbüsch et al, 2020) . We showed previously that RILPL1 enhances the pericentriolar clustering of pRab10-containing membrane compartments (Dhekne et al, 2018) . We therefore explored the relationship between RILPL2 expression and pRab10 distribution. In cells expressing R1441G LRRK2 to generate pRab10, RILPL2 was cytosolic (Red, Fig. 3A ) and a fraction (~20%) was concentrated in the peri-centriolar region with pRab10 (Green, Figs. 3A, B). pRab10 was significantly more concentrated in the centriolar region than RILPL2 under these conditions. Upon co-transfection in control cells, RILPL2 and MyoVa showed minimal colocalization that was limited to a few distinct puncta, and most RILPL2 protein was cytosolic (Fig. 3C ).
Introduction of pathogenic R1441G LRRK2 caused essentially all of the MyoVa and RILPL2 proteins to concentrate in the peri-centriolar region and to colocalize in more than 80% of the cells (Fig. 3D, top row) . Importantly, addition of the MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor for two hours completely reversed the phenotype; under these conditions, pRab10 staining was lost and both RILPL2 and MyoVa proteins reverted to a diffuse localization in 90% of cells (Figs. 3D, E) . Thus, in the absence of LRRK2, MyoVa appears to disperse RILPL2 but in the presence of pathogenic LRRK2 which generates pericentriolar pRab10, RILPL2 and MyoVa strongly relocalize to the mother centriole.

MyoVa binds both Rab10 and RILPL2 (Lisé et al, 2009; Roland et al, 2009) . Without exogenous RILPL2 co-expression (unlike Fig. 3C ), R1441G LRRK2 activity led to the relocalization of ~40% MyoVa to the pericentriolar region where it co-localized with pRab10 ( Fig. 4A ). Under these conditions, pRab10 was highly concentrated at the centriole and >80% of pRab10 colocalized with MyoVa (Fig. 4B ). LRRK2 phosphorylates multiple Rab GTPases in addition to Rab10 including Rabs 8, 12, 35 and 43 (Steger et al, 2017) .
Nevertheless, Rab10 was absolutely required for the LRRK2-triggered relocalization of MyoVa or RILPL2 tested independently, as neither protein re-localized to the centriole in cells depleted of Rab10 or treated with LRRK2 inhibitor, MLi-2 (Figs. 4C-E). Figure 5A diagrams the domain structure of Myosin V proteins. The N-terminal motor domain is followed by a series of IQ motifs and a set of variably spliced exons. At the Cterminus, the MyoVa globular tail domain (GTD) can interact with Rab3A (Wollert et al, 2011 ), Rab11 (Roland et al, 2009 Lindsay et al, 2013; Pylypenko et al, 2013 Pylypenko et al, , 2016 and with Rab27A via the Slac2/Melanophilin adaptor (Fukuda et al, 2002; Hume et al, 2002; Wei et al, 2013) in different cell types. Importantly, Exon D that is conserved in all Myosin Vs contains a binding site for Rab10 (Roland et al, 2009) . Exon D-containing forms of MyoVa are expressed broadly, but not in brain or endocrine/neuroendocrine cells (Seperack et al, 1995; Roland et al, 2009) . We therefore created a MyoVa truncation construct that deletes Exon D (MyoVa-ΔD lacking amino acids 1320-1345) or enables expression of the GTD alone (residues 1421 to 1880; Fig. 5A ).
In HEK-293T cells, mCherry-tagged versions of MyoVa-FL (full length MyoVa) and GTD were mostly cytosolic (Fig. 5B ). When MyoVa-FL was co-expressed with GFP-Rab10, more of it re-localized to perinuclear, Rab10 containing vesicles (Fig. 5C ), consistent with its established binding capacity. In contrast, Exon D-deleted MyoVa (MyoVa-ΔD) showed much less colocalization with Figs. 5C, E) . Surprisingly, expression of R1441G pathogenic LRRK2 relocalized both MyoVa-FL (Fig. 4C ) and the MyoVa-ΔD to perinuclear membrane structures positive for pRab10 (Fig. 5D ). Quantitation of colocalization revealed that MyoVa colocalized with pRab10 to almost the same extent, with or without Exon D (Fig. 5E ). Importantly, even the normally diffuse GTD (Fig. 5B ) redistributed to pericentriolar, pRab10 + membranes ( Fig. 5F ): 35% of total MyoVa GTD colocalized with pRab10, while ~80% of pRab10 co-localized with GTD (Fig. 5G) . These values match closely the extent of RILPL2 relocalization seen in earlier experiments (Fig. 3) .
The ability of pRab10 to relocalize both MyoVa-ΔD and the GTD strongly suggested that the MyoVa GTD contains a pRab10-specific binding site. This was tested in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells expressing R1441G LRRK2. As shown in Fig. 6 , full length MyoVa-mCherry bound both Rab10 and pRab10; binding of both forms decreased in the presence of MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor, suggesting that pRab10 was a significant contributor to MyoVa binding. Similarly, MyoVa-ΔD lacking the D exon-Rab10 binding site still bound roughly the same amount of pRab10 and less total Rab10 protein (Figs. 6A,B) . These experiments strongly suggest that MyoVa-ΔD contains an additional binding site with preference for pRab10. Indeed, similar analysis of binding to the GTD domain in cell .

In experiments in which we monitored binding to RILPL2-GFP, MyoVa-GTD bound with or without LRRK2 activity, but we detected about twice as much MyoVa-GTD and Rab10 precipitating with RILPL2 in cells expressing R1441G LRRK2 (Figs. 6D,E). These data are consistent with pRab10 binding both RILPL2 and MyoVa, perhaps forming a ternary complex. Since RILPL2 can dimerize (Wei et al, 2013; Waschbüsch et al, 2020) , it is possible that each half of the dimer engages either MyoVa or pRab10 or both. Alternatively, pRab10 may enhance the ability of MyoVa to bind RILPL2.
To demonstrate more directly the presence of a pRab10-specific binding site in the MyoVa GTD, we used microscale thermophoresis (MST) to monitor binding of purified proteins.
Bacterially expressed, purified Rab10 was phosphorylated in vitro using Mst3, a promiscuous kinase used previously to phosphorylate purified Rab8 and Rab10 proteins (Berndsen et al, 2019; Waschbüsch et al, 2020) . In vitro phosphorylation of Rab10 proceeded linearly for ~100 minutes before reaching a plateau in reactions containing 2mM ATP and a ratio of 1:3 kinase:substrate at 27°C, as detected using a phosphoRab10-specific antibody (Fig. 7A ). As expected, the reaction was ATP dependent (Fig. 7B) , and phosphorylation was efficient:
~90% of Rab10 was phosphorylated in reactions containing Mst3 kinase as determined by PhosTag gel electrophoresis that enables resolution of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Rab10 proteins (Fig. 7C ).

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 28, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 /2020 Because it is difficult to purify significant quantities of fully active and phosphorylated Rab10, we established a protocol that would enable us to monitor pRab10 binding to MyoVa with minimal protein handling. As outlined in Fig. 7D , Rab10 was incubated for 120 minutes with Mst3 kinase and ATP to achieve phosphorylation. NT-647 dye-labelled GTD was added for a subsequent 30 minute binding reaction, followed by transfer of the binding mix into capillaries for microscale thermophoresis analysis. Control reactions contained all the same components except ATP during binding; no signal was observed in reactions lacking Rab10 protein.
Phosphorylated Rab10 bound to purified MyoVa GTD with a K D of 475 ± 166 nM under these conditions (Fig. 8A ). This represents strong binding as most Rab effectors bind with low micromolar affinities. Non-phosphorylated Rab10 assayed in parallel showed no binding to GTD in reactions containing up to 18 µM GTD (Fig. 8B ). As a positive control, Rab11A also bound to the MyoVa GTD with a K D of ~246 ± 216 nM (Fig. 8C ). This affinity is similar to that previously reported for Rab11A binding to the closely related Myosin Vb GTD (Pylypenko et al, 2013) . In summary, these in vitro binding assays confirm that pRab10 binds directly and with high affinity to the MyoVa GTD.
We showed previously that overexpression of RILPL1 was sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE and A549 cells (Dhekne et al, 2018) . In addition, LRRK2 generation of pRab10 was sufficient to block ciliogenesis but this required that cells contain endogenous RILPL1 protein (Dhekne et al, 2018) . We thus tested the effect of exogenous RILPL2 expression on primary . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As shown in Fig. 9 (A,B) , even in the absence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 expression strongly inhibited cilia formation. In addition, clonal RILPL1 and RILPL2 knockout A549 cell lines were created using CRISPR.
As we reported previously (Dhekne et al, 2018) , endogenous RILPL1 depletion in these cells dramatically increased cilia formation, consistent with its role as a suppressor of ciliogenesis.
In contrast, RILPL2 depletion did not influence ciliation in two independent knockout lines ( Fig. 9C ).
Ciliogenesis is initiated by Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2)-mediated phosphorylation events that drive the uncapping of CP110 from the mother centriole (Spektor et al, 2007; Goetz et al, 2012) . To further explore the mechanism of RILPL2-mediated cilia blockade, we investigated the effect of RILPL2 expression on centriolar CP110 cap removal upon serum withdrawal. As shown in Figure 9D , fewer cells expressing RILPL2 lost CP110 from their mother centrioles, indicating that RILPL2 expression inhibits ciliogenesis at an early stage, upstream of TTBK2. CP110 also failed to be released from the mother centriole in MyoVadepleted cells within 2 hours of serum starvation (Fig. 9D ), a condition that leads to redistribution of RILPL2 to the mother centriole ( Figure 2C ,D).
Wu et al (2018) reported that MyoVa knockout cells showed no effect on CP110 release but had a striking defect in ciliary vesicle association with mother centriole. This difference might be explained by adaptation in knockout clones and/or a very short time of serum starvation The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 28, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.065664 doi: bioRxiv preprint and longer serum starvation (2 hours in serum free medium) in our experiments (Fig. 9D ).
Upon serum starvation, pre-ciliary vesicles fuse to form a ciliary vesicle in an EHD1 dependent manner, a step that is essential for CP110 uncapping and subsequent ciliogenesis (Lu et al, 2015) . Consistent with a role in trafficking pre-ciliary vesicles in early ciliogenesis (Wu et al, 2018) , MyoVa depletion in our experiments blocked CP110 uncapping. It is possible that tight binding to either exogenously expressed RILPL2 or pRab10 generated by LRRK2 sequesters MyoVa in a manner that cannot carry out its normal roles in cilia formation.
Altogether, the experiments presented here suggest that RILPL2 is usually removed from the centriolar region by MyoVa, unless cells express pathogenic LRRK2 and generate significant levels of peri-centriolar pRab10 protein. Under those conditions, or conditions of RILPL2 overexpression, RILPL2 and MyoVa accumulate at the centriole concomitant with a block in the formation of primary cilia. Moreover, the absence of MyoVa exon D in the brain is predicted to lead to the greatest change in MyoVa localization when pRab10 is present.
RILPL2 binds LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10 with greater affinity than non-phosphorylated Rab10 (Steger et al, 2017) , and although RILPL2 is known to bind MyoVa (Lisé et al, 2009) and contribute in some way to cargo enrichment in ciliogenesis (Schaub & Stearns, 2013) , little is known about its precise cellular function. We have shown here that RILPL2 is diffusely localized in RPE cells, and a small portion moves to the mother centriole within ~3 hours of serum starvation (Figs. 10A,B). The dispersed localization of RILPL2 is controlled . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This suggests that MyoVa functions at least in part to transport RILPL2 away from the mother centriole. In contrast, when expression of pathogenic R1441G LRRK2 increases pRab10 at the mother centriole, RILPL2 levels also increase there, and additional co-expression of low levels of MyoVa is sufficient to drive essentially all RILPL2 to the centriole (Fig. 10D ). MyoVa is normally broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm but it also concentrated at the mother centriole when pRab10 levels are high. In addition, peri-centriolar concentration of MyoVa and RILPL2 both require Rab10 protein.
Our studies revealed that pRab10 interacts directly and tightly with MyoVa's globular tail domain, and this interaction is likely responsible for the relocalization of MyoVa to the centriole in R1441G LRRK2-expressing cells. This was unexpected, because pRab10 could have easily influenced MyoVa localization indirectly via RILPL2 binding. The globular tail domain of MyoVa is a versatile cargo adaptor with independent binding sites for RILPL2, Rab11A, Rab3A and melanophilin. Future experiments will determine the precise interface between pRab10 and MyoVa and whether or not pRab10 binding precludes interaction with additional binding partners. That MyoVa is a Rab11 effector suggests that it will function as part of the Rab11:Rab8 cascade that is an important part of the early steps of cilia formation (Knödler et al, 2010; Franco et al, 2014) .

PhosphoRab10 represents a potent interaction partner for RILPL1, RILPL2 and MyoVa globular tail domain. Interestingly, all of these proteins are implicated in some way in the normal process of ciliogenesis and all become clustered around the mother centriole in cells expressing pathogenic LRRK2 kinase that are blocked in ciliogenesis. Are any of these components more important than another in regulating cilia formation? In our previous work, we showed that RILPL1 and Rab10 are essential components of the LRRK2-mediated, ciliogenesis blockade (Dhekne et al, 2018) . Here we show that loss of RILPL2 has no consequence for cilia formation, while RILPL1 depletion significantly enhances cilia formation. According to mapofthecell.biochem.mpg.de, RILPL1 is present at 72,522 copies per HeLa cell and 98% cytosolic, compared with 45,719 copies of MyoVa, which fractionates most significantly with endosomal markers (Itzhak et al, 2016) . However, RILPL2 was below detection in this tour de force mass spectrometry experiment (Itzhak et al, 2016) . Similarly, the ratio of RILPL2 to RILPL1 is quite variable across tissues (pax-db.org) and cell lines and thus differences in the contributions of RILPL1 and RILPL2 to ciliogenesis blockade may reflect their relative abundance in different cell types. Unlike RILPL2, RILPL1 does not bind MyoVa. As described herein, any role for RILPL2 in blocking ciliogenesis likely requires MyoVa participation since it so significantly altered RILPL2's cellular distribution.
Although it is not yet known how RILPL2 becomes localized to the mother centriole upon serum starvation, it's expression at higher than endogenous levels is coupled with a block in .

Release of the CP110 cap by the action of Tau tubulin kinase 2 and EHD1/3 dependent ciliary vesicle formation are essential steps in the process of ciliogenesis (Spektor et al, 2007; Goetz et al, 2012; Lu et al, 2015) . MyoVa depletion also blocks release of CP110 in our experiments, and this may be explained in part, by the increase in peri-centriolar RILPL2 seen in cells depleted of MyoVa. Indeed, MyoVa strongly regulated RILPL2's localization, consistent with their tight molecular association and cooperative roles. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2 kinase, MyoVa and pRab10 drive a major relocalization of RILPL2 to the mother centriole, and it will be important to explore further how this contributes to a pathogenic LRRK2-triggered ciliogenesis blockade.
Reagents: MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor was obtained from Tocris Biosciences (Cat. No. 5756).
General cloning and plasmids: DNA constructs were amplified in E. coli DH5α or stbl3 and purified using mini prep columns (Econospin).

RPE cells were transfected with Fugene HD (Promega) while A549 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer. RPE cells stably expressing mKO2-PACT were generated by lentivirus as described at (Sobu et al, 2020) . Cells were checked routinely for Mycoplasma using either MycoALert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza LT07-318) or PCR. Cells were grown to confluence in DMEM with serum. hTERT-RPE cells were ciliated by overnight serum starvation in DMEM medium alone. For A549 cells, cells were plated at 80% confluency and 24h later, subjected to 2% serum for 48h. To identify primary cilia, cells were stained for a cilia marker, Arl13b. For monitoring CP110 release, RPE cells were serum starved for 1h. Cultures of primary rat astrocytes were obtained by antibody panning from rat pups as described (Foo et al, 2011; Dhekne et al, 2018) . In brief, six to ten postnatal Sprague-Dawley rat cortices were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated to produce single cells. They were passed over successive, antibody-coated negative panning plates to rid the suspension of microglia, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells before selecting for astrocytes with an anti-ITGB5-coated plate. Astrocytes that attached to the anti-ITGB5coated plate were trypsinized and plated onto poly-D lysine coated ACLAR coverslips. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 10% CO2 and 90% O2 for one to three weeks.
Lentivirus-based shRNA was used for gene knockdown of human Rab10. The lentiviral vector was co-transfected with packaging vectors psPAX2, pMD2 VSV-G in HEK293T cells using PEI. pLKO-puro-scramble was used as control. After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected and virus concentrated 10x overnight with Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) according to the manufacturer. Cells were transduced with virus using polybrene (2 µg/ml). To make stable cells, infected cells were selected with puromycin (0.2-1 µg/ml) 48 h after infection. Expression of the target protein was verified by qPCR and/or immunoblotting.
For silencing of the Rab10 gene, lentivirus pLKO.1-Rab10 shRNA was used to infect HEK293T cells as described (Dhekne et al, 2018) . For silencing MyoVa, siRNA against MyoVa was obtained from Invitrogen (s9207, 5' GUAUAGUCCUAGUAGCUA 3') as this was shown to work well by Wu et al (2018) , and transfected at 30 nM final concentration using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer.

Lysates were centrifuged at 13800 x g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatants quantified by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific) and 60 µg and 400 µg of proteins used for immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation assay, respectively. Antibodies were diluted in a blocking buffer containing 5% milk in 0.05% Tween in Tris buffered saline (TBS) and incubated overnight on the blots. Phos-tag (Fujifilm Wako) gels were made according to the manufacturer using 40 µM Phostag, 80 µM MnCl 2 in a 10% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide gel. The phostag gel was washed for 15 min in 10 mM EDTA/Water, followed by 5 min wash in 1 mM EDTA/water and finally, distilled water. Phosphorylated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for 20 min using a Biorad Transblot system. Lysis for qPCR was performed by solubilizing cells in 500 µl Trizol. RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized using Expand Multiscribe cDNA synthesis kit (4368814) by Applied Biosystems. 1:10 diluted cDNA was then subjected to qPCR using Powerup Sybr green master mix (Thermo) in an Applied Biosystem ViiA 7 qPCR machine. qPCR primers were from Origene (MyoVa Fw -CTCACACGAACTCCTGCAAA, MyoVa Rv -AGGGGTAGTGGCATTGAGTG). The mRNA expression analysis was performed using the delta delta Ct method.
Co-Immunoprecipitation: HEK293T cells expressing RILPL2-GFP, MyoVa-mCherry or myc-LRRK2 R1441G were harvested 24-48 h post-transfection and lysed. Equal amounts of extract protein were incubated with GFP-binding protein-conjugated agarose (Chromotek) or anti-RFP antibody (Anti-RFP RTU -Rockland Biosciences) conjugated protein G beads (Thermo) for 1 h at 4°C. Immobilized proteins were washed 4 times with 1 ml lysis buffer, eluted with 2X SDS loading buffer, and subjected to BioRad Mini-PROTEIN TGX 4-20% gradient gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and antibody incubation, blots were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 27°C for 30 min -4.5 h in a water bath. Phosphorylation completion was assessed by western blot and PhosTag gel electrophoresis and found to saturate at 2 h. Immediately following phosphorylation, samples were transferred to ice prior to binding determination.
Protein-protein interactions were monitored by MST using a Monolith NT.115 instrument (Nanotemper Technologies). His 6 -MyoVa GTD was labeled using RED-NHS 2 nd Generation (Amine Reactive) Protein Labeling Kit (Nanotemper Technologies). For all experiments, the unlabeled protein partner was titrated against a fixed concentration of the fluorescently labeled GTD (100 nM); 16 serially diluted titrations of the unlabeled protein partner were prepared to generate one complete binding isotherm. Binding was carried out in reaction buffer in 0.5mL Protein Lobind tubes (Eppendorf) and allowed to incubate in the dark for 30 min before loading into NT.115 premium treated capillaries (Nanotemper Technologies). A red LED at 10% excitation power (red filter, excitation 605-645 nm, emission 680-685 nm) and IR-laser power at 20% was used for 30 sec followed by 1 sec of cooling. Data analysis was performed with NTAffinityAnalysis software (NanoTemper Technologies) in which the binding isotherms were derived from the raw fluorescence data and then fitted with both NanoTemper software and GraphPad Prism to determine the K D using a non-linear regression method. The binding affinities determined by the two methods were similar. Shown are averaged curves of pRab10 and Rab10 from single readings from two different protein preparations.
