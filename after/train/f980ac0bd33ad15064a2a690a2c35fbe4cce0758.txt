SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since infected over 1.5 25 million people, of which over 107,000 have died. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet, 26 speculations remain about the range of human cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this 27 study, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from two cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada. 28
We determined the genomic sequences of the two isolates and identified single nucleotide 29 changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. More importantly, we tested a wide 30 range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm that 31 human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not permissive for SARS-CoV-32 2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor single nucleotide 33 polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine viral 34 genotype and phenotype using in vitro and in vivo infection models. 35
6 Pellets were washed with distilled water and en-bloc stained with 2% uranyl acetate in distilled 116 water for 2 hrs. Pellets were washed with distilled water and dehydrated in an ethanol series. 117
Pellets were infiltrated with Embed 812/Araldite resin and cured at 65 degrees for 48 hrs. Resin 118 blocks were trimmed, polished and 90 nm thin sections were ultramicrotomed (Leica Reichert 119 Ultracut E, https://www.leica-microsystems.com) and mounted on TEM grids. Thin sections 120 were stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 5% lead citrate. Sections were imaged using 121
Transmission Electron Microscopy (ThermoFisher Scientific Talos L120C, 122 https://www.thermofisher.com) using a LaB6 filament at 120kV. 10 fields per cell type were 123 scanned. Each field was imaged with different magnifications at 2600x, 8500x, 17500x and 124 36000x. 125
Flowcytometry 126
To prepare cells for flowcytometry, 100µL (400,000 cells) of primary CD4 + , CD8 + , CD19 + and 127 monocytes were washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and spun at 500 g for 5 128 minutes. The cells were resuspended in 100 µL of Live/Dead Violet (ThermoFisher Scientific, 129 https://www.thermofisher.com) as per manufacturer's recommendation and diluted 1:1000 in 130 PBS. Cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. Next, cells were washed with 1 ml of FACS 131 buffer (in-house reagent) and spun at 500 g for 5 minutes. Cells were then stained with 100 µL of 132 their respective stains (aCD4-FITC, aCD8-FITC, aCD19-FITC, aCD14-APC; Biolegend, 133 https://www.biolegend.com) at a concentration of 1µg/mL for 30 min at 4°C. After staining, the 134 cells were washed with 1mL of FACS Buffer and spun at 500 g for 5 minutes. Extra aliquots of 135 cells were left unstained, which were also spun at 500g for 5 minutes. The pellets were 136 resuspended in 100 µL of 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA; ThermoFisher Scientific, 137 https://www.thermofisher.com) and analyzed.

We collected 200 uL of cell culture supernatant and re-infected a fresh layer 185 of Vero E6 cells. Twenty-four hours post infection, both wells containing cells that were re-186 inoculated displayed extensive CPE (Figure 1, panel B) . We extracted viral RNA from the 187 supernatant and confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a diagnostic real-time PCR assay 188 (qPCR; Figure 1 , panel C). We also confirmed the presence of coronavirus-like particles in 189 infected Vero E6 cells by electron microscopy (Figure 1, panel D) . 190 191 Next, we performed genome sequencing of both isolates, generating genome sequences with 192 7500-8000 fold coverage and ~94% completeness, with only ~260 bp and ~200 bp at the 5' and 193 3' termini undetermined (Table 1 ). Both shared synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions 194 with those independently observed in direct sequencing of clinical isolates (Table 1; In this study, we report the isolation of two replication competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates from 229 COVID-19 patients in Canada.

Exogenous trypsin activates SARS-CoV spike proteins more 231 efficiently and facilitates cellular entry (19). Exogenous trypsin treatment has also been shown to 232 enhance infectivity of other zoonotic bat-borne coronaviruses (20). Furthermore, TPCK-treated 233 trypsin was used to successfully isolate SARS-CoV-2 in China (1). In our studies, subsequent 234 infection and virus replication did not require any additional TPCK-treated trypsin (Figure 1,  235 panel B). The presence of CPE alone does not indicate the successful isolation of a coronavirus. 236
Mid-turbinate samples from adults with acute respiratory distress may often contain other 237 microbes, including viruses (21). Thus, to identify our isolates, we sequenced them to confirm 238 that they were reflective of SARS-CoV-2 isolates infecting patients worldwide, selecting SARS-239
