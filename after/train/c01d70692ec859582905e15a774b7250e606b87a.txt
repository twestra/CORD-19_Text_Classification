Between-production systems transmission: the contribution of within-system PRRSv circulation 130
We estimated the contribution of local transmission (i.e., between farms within a production system) 132 versus external introductions (i.e., between farms across production systems) using a structured 133 coalescent model. Due to computational demand, we used PRRSv alignment from MEGA software 134 MASCOT, we estimated the effective population size in the local and external population and the 142 migration rates between them, which was allowed to be asymmetric. This analysis was replicated three 143 times, each time using one of the three pig systems as local and the other two as external. We also 144 calculated the posterior probability of each internal node in the tree being in each state (i.e., local or 145 external) using the forwards/backwards approach implemented in MASCOT (Müller et al., 2018) . 146
All analyses were performed under 100 million MCMC runs, states were sampled every 10,000 147 and the first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in using TreeAnnotator v. 2.3.0 (Rambaut and 148 Drummond, 2016) . We reconstructed the number of migration events through time using the ancestral 149 locations reconstructed by MASCOT. A migration event was assumed to occur when the most probable 150 location of a lineage changed between its parent and child node, with the time of the migration event 151 assumed to be the date of the daughter node. Migration events (local and external) per month were plotted 152 using "baltic" (https://github.com/blab/baltic) in Python Software Foundation version 3.7, available at 153 http://www.python.org. Finally, we compared the differences in local vs external transmission between 154
PRRSv season and off-season through two-sample Wilcoxon test (Hogg et al., 2010), PRRSv season was 155 determined by the exponentially weighted moving average proposed by MSHMP (MSHMP, 2020). 156
To determine the effect of different predictors on the spread of PRRSv, we analyzed the results of the 158 continuous phylogeographic analysis using the R package "seraphim" version 1.0 (Dellicour et al., 2016)., 159 considering a continuous location approach (based on the geographic coordinate location of each pig 160 farm) and a random walk diffusion model. Spatiotemporal information was extracted from 100 trees 161 sampled at regular intervals from the posterior distribution, after burn-in, to account for phylogenetic 162 uncertainty. Each phylogenetic branch was considered a vector defined by its start and end location (e.g. 163 latitude and longitude), and its start and end dates. Statistical significance for the correlation between 164
phylogenetic and predictive factors was tested using 100 trees generated and expressed in the form of 165
Bayes factors (BF) (Dellicour et al., 2016). Based on the extracted spatio-temporal information contained 166 in each phylogenetic tree described above, we calculated the distances based on predictor variables 167 associated with every branch of each tree, which were used to determine the correlation between the 168 duration of each branch in the phylogeny and its related predictor variable distance, including the annual 169 temperature, annual precipitation, elevation, runoff (an index that quantity of water discharged in surface 170 streams), soil humidity (commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes) 171 (Sørensen et al., 2005) , enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which can be used to quantify vegetation 172 greenness, as well as the pig density, and distance to the main roads ( Fig. 1 and Table S3 for more 173 details). Briefly, the distance between each farm (geographic coordinates) to the nearest main road was 174 calculated based on the Euclidean distance. We calculated the statistic Q, which represents how much 175 variation in lineage movement is explained with spatial heterogeneity when each predictor variable is 176 considered (Dellicour, Rose and Pybus, 2016). Here, Q= R 2 env -R 2 null where R 2 env is the coefficient of 177 determination obtained from the regression between branch duration against predictor (factors) distances, 178 while R 2 null represents the coefficient of determination for the regression between branch duration against 179 predictor distances, which were replaced by a null raster. Thus, the factors that were considered for 180 further Bayes factor (BF) analysis, were the ones that obtained positive Q values in at least 90% of the 181 tested trees (Jacquot et al., 2017). We approximated a BF value for all predictors tested that passed the 182 above-mentioned Q statistic. Predictive factors were treated as a conductance (variables that promote the 183 spread of the disease) or a resistance factor (variables that impede its spread). For the interpretation of BF, 184 values between 3-20 were considered "positively" supported, values between 20-150 were considered 185 "strong", and values >150 were considered " overwhelming support" (Kass and Raftery, 1995 supplementary Table S1 ). 193
The results of PRRSv ancestral reconstruction showed that the most likely center of origin was production The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034181 doi: bioRxiv preprint origin was a sow farm (RSPP = 0.47), followed by an almost equal probability for origins in finisher farm 207 (RSPP = 0.27) and nursery farm (RSPP = 0.26), the boar stud farms were negligible (RSPP < 0.01) (Fig.  208 3A). In recent years, there was an evident increase in the proportion of PRRSv positive finisher farms, 209 reaching a similar level of representation than sow farms for some clusters (Fig. 3A) . SkyGrid plot 210 revealed a relatively constant trend of relative genetic diversity until ~2011, showing a linear increase in 211 population size, which reached its highest levels ~2016 (Fig. 3B) . We observed a similar trend when we 212 analyzed all systems together (Fig. 3B) , 2015 and 2018 were the years with more samples sent to be 213 sequenced (Fig. 3B) . 214
For production system B, a sow farm (RSPP = 0.4) was also the most likely origin; however, a 215 high probability was also linked to a nursery farm (RSPP = 0.33) ( 
The reconstructed spatiotemporal diffusion of PRRSv was characterized by continuous expansion in the 227 geographic space, accompanied by diversification events. The comparison between each system and all 228 samples together showed two noticeable patterns. The first one was characterized by a radial expansion 229 over time, found when all samples were analyzed together and within samples of system A. In contrast, 230 systems B and C evidenced a directional trend, since for both systems the spread started in the southwest 231 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In the case of system B, PRRSv spread to the northeast, while for system C, the spread was 232 mainly to the north, though spread did occur in all directions (see Supplementary Figs. S1-3). 233
The spatiotemporal analysis showed that when all sequences were analyzed together, the 234 estimated median value for the mean branch velocity was 39 km/year (95% HPD = 31.2-61.1). This 235 median value was lower than that shown by system A (49.2 km/year, 95% HPD= 42.9-60.4), and higher 236 than the values observed in systems B and C (32.7 km/year, 95% HPD= 29.1-43.3), and (26.4 km/year, 237 95% HPD= 20.1-41.0), respectively. Estimated diffusion coefficients were asymmetric for each system 238 and when all samples were analyzed together. System A showed the highest diffusivity (243.8 km 2 /year); 239 however, its diffusion variation among branches was the lowest registered. The overall results (all 240 sequences) evidenced the highest among-branch variation, while its diffusion coefficient (150 km 2 /year) 241 was lower than system A and substantially higher than the other systems. Systems B and C showed a 242 similar pattern in terms of diffusion coefficient variation among branches; however, B was higher than C 243 (97 km 2 /year) and (51 km 2 /year), respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). 244
Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) identified that the most significant disseminations 246 were highly related to system A, evidencing strong support by a Bayes Factor score > 20. The statistical 247 support or evidence for system A sourcing most PRRSv strains to system B, BF = 102.1 (average relative 248 migration rate "ARMR"= 1.79), followed by dissemination from A to C, BF = 47.8 (ARMR = 0.46); of 249 less importance was from B to A, BF= 27.4 (ARMR = 0.35). All the other disseminations between 250 production systems were also positive, but to a lesser degree than the ones mentioned above (Table 1) . In 251 addition, a sensitivity analysis aimed to evaluate the bias related to oversampling showed that while 252 numerically it was a difference the interpretation remains the same, but we noticed that in the subsample 253 there was even more support for the dissemination from company B to C and company C to A ( see 254
Supplementary Table S5 for more details). Our analysis reveals that when comparing PRRSv 255 dissemination between types of farms, the most frequent routes were linked with sow farms, especially 256 when the direction of spread was from sow to nursery (BF > 42). The highest support for this route 257 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034181 doi: bioRxiv preprint occurred when we analyzed all systems combined (BF = 109). The second most well-supported 258 dissemination occurred from sow to finisher farms (BF > 17.9), and as in the previous case, was best 259 supported when we analyzed all systems together. (BF = 80.5). Likewise, the dissemination between 260 nursery and finisher farms (in both directions) also showed positive support (BF > 6). However, all routes 261 of dissemination that involved boar stud farms were rare events (BF < 3) (Table 2) . Furthermore, the 262 sensitivity analysis showed similar trends, where the results of the equal sample sizes these were less 263
sharp than the one using the original dataset. However, the transmissions that involved BoarStud were all 264 negligible (see Supplementary Table S6 for more details). 265
We tracked the origin of the migration events leading to the current PRRSv lineages circulating among 268 the three pig systems, to determine whether detected PRRSv strains originated from within the same that were observed in all pig companies; this tendency was constant during the whole period of study 275 (Fig. 6) . When looking at the difference between local transmission against external introductions, system 276 C showed the largest number of external introductions with 73.8% of all transmission events inferred to 277 be external introductions, while systems A and B exhibited 56.6% and 58.7% respectively (Table 3) . In 278 addition, our results show that overall, the external introduction events tend to increase over time (Table  279 3). We also observed that coinciding with the month of higher incidence of PRRSv (MSHMP, 2020) ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034181 doi: bioRxiv preprint
To quantify the impact of each factor on PRRSv distribution, we calculated the association between 285 lineage duration and each covariate scaled distance through the Q statistic method. We found strong 286 support (Q value was positive) for pig density and distance to main roads treated as conductance factors, 287 while elevation and vegetation presented strong support as resistance factors (see Supplementary Table  288 S8 and Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6 for more details). These results also received statistical support 289 provided by Bayes factors (BF) since we observed that farms located in areas with a high density of pig 290 farms were more exposed to the introduction of PRRSv (BF > 12). Likewise, the distance between the 291 farm and the nearest major road also showed a positive association with PRRSv diffusion (BF > 7). In 292 contrast, the factors identified as negative drivers, variables that act as barriers for the spread of PRRSv, 293
were higher elevation and denser vegetation (BF > 3) (Supplementary Table S8) . 294
This analysis detailed the evolutionary epidemiology of PRRSv among commercially related and 296 unrelated farms through continuous and discrete phylogeographic analyses. Overall, a decline in PRRSv 297 genetic diversity was observed over time. Such findings could have different explanations, one being a 298 rapid and efficient disseminating strain that was introduced into sow farms which consequently was 299 transferred to growing pig sites through regular pig movement. Another potential explanation could be 300 related to the efficacy of current interventions that local production systems have implemented, which 301 reduced the volume and frequency of newly emerging strains, suggesting a more optimistic scenario than 302 The estimated speed in which PRRSv was spreading was 39 km/year which was slightly higher 333 than previous observations in a study that used data from one production system in another U.S. region 334 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034181 doi: bioRxiv preprint spatial distribution of the sampled sequences (Dellicour et al., 2019) . Finally, our samples represent the 412
circulating PRRS viral population, as data comes from 92% of pig farms in one highly dense pig region. 413
Our study revealed significant asymmetries in the phylodynamic patterns among farms of three pig 415 production systems. As a result of interventions that could be related to immunization and on-farm 416 biosecurity, PRRSv genetic diversity has consistently declined in this region, especially in the last two The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034181 doi: bioRxiv preprint .
