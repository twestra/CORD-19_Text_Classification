While social distancing is a key response to viral pandemics, social stress has been implicated in adverse health outcomes. A comprehensive understanding of the direct physiologic effects of social stress on viral pathophysiology is needed. To determine the effect of social stress on HIV pathogenesis during acute viral infection without sociobehavioral confounders inherent in human cohorts, we compared commonly 25 measured parameters of HIV progression between singly and socially housed SIVinfected pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Singly housed macaques demonstrated lower CD4/CD8 ratios, greater CD4 T cell declines and greater T cell activation compared to socially housed macaques during acute SIV infection. Singly housed macaques furthermore had higher viral loads in the plasma and cerebrospinal 30 fluid throughout acute infection. These data demonstrate that social stress directly impacts the pathogenesis of acute lentiviral infection and imply that social stress has a direct effect on the pathogenesis of HIV and potentially other viral infections.
Social stress impacts the pathogenesis of acute HIV infection, leading to immune 35 system dysregulation and higher viral load.
Social stress is an environmental factor that has a measurable impact on general health outcomes (reviewed in 1). Today, social stress has taken on greater societal significance, with social distancing practices vital to slow the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 40 contributing to increased psychological distress in physicians and health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients (2-4). The logical next question of how social stress . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

While data is currently unavailable for analysis in the COVID- 19 pandemic, other viral pandemics, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), may 45 provide insight. HIV infection remains widespread and, while people with HIV (PWH) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) today live relatively normal lives compared to untreated individuals, outcomes for PWH vary greatly and depend upon a number of factors, including social stress. PWH are at higher risk for social stress due to stigma associated with infection and marginalization of people from demographics that are 50 considered at higher risk of infection (5) . Not surprisingly, PWH report decreased physical and mental well-being compared to the general population (6) , and worse mental and physical quality of life than individuals with other chronic illnesses (7).
It has been difficult to determine the direct physiologic effects of social stress on viral pathogenesis and mechanisms through which such stress affects outcomes due to 55 the multifaceted nature of social stress and sociobehavioral confounders that have the potential to limit access to effective care or otherwise compromise health. Animal models have historically been beneficial for parsing out biological mechanisms that can be oversimplified with in vitro studies but may be muddled in studies with human cohorts. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques recapitulates many 60 aspects of HIV pathogenesis, including decline in circulating CD4 T cells following infection and persistence of virus in latent reservoirs despite ART (8 
To examine the effect of social stress on immune system parameters commonly measured while monitoring the progression of HIV infection, we completed a 80 retrospective comparison of numbers of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells and lymphocytes in singly and socially housed pigtailed macaques using linear mixed effects regression models. The CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio was examined first, as a lower ratio is associated with negative outcomes in PWH (10). CD4/CD8 ratio was 18% lower in singly housed animals at day 14 following inoculation compared to socially housed 85 animals (p=0.04), though ratios decreased as expected for both singly and socially housed following infection (Fig.1A, p=0 .0004).

These differential declines originated pre-inoculation, during which CD4 T cell numbers were 27.8% higher (Fig.1B, p=0 .007), CD8 T cells were 25.9% higher (Fig.1C, p=0 .0006) and lymphocytes were 28% higher (Fig.1D, p=0.0004) in singly housed compared to socially housed animals. Greater recovery in CD8 T cell ( Fig.1C ; p=0.0003) and lymphocyte number ( Fig.1D ; p=0.01) at day 14 in 95 singly housed compared to socially housed macaques additionally contributed to lower CD4/CD8 in singly housed animals.
To further determine the effect of social stress on immune dysregulation in response to SIV infection, we examined CD8 and CD4 T cell activation. As expected, all 100 macaques had heightened CD8 T cell activation during acute infection, demonstrated by increased percentage of cells expressing CD69, with peak activation on day 7 ( Fig.2A; p=0 .001). However, singly housed animals had 68% more CD69+ CD8 T cells at peak activation compared to socially housed (p=0.0007). Notably, singly housed macaques had 9.2-fold more CD69+ CD4 T cells at peak activation in acute infection 105 compared to pre-inoculation values ( Fig.2B ; p<0.0001) whereas socially housed animals demonstrated negligible activation.

Singly housed macaques had higher viral loads in plasma than socially housed counterparts throughout acute infection (by 6.1%, 6.5% and 21% on days 7, 10 and 14, respectively) ( Fig.3A ; p<0.0001). In the CSF, singly 115 housed macaques had even higher viral loads than socially housed macaques (13%, 12% and 18%, respectively, at the same timepoints) ( Fig.3B ; p<0.0001). The magnitude of the difference in viral loads between the singly and socially housed macaques compounded over time in the plasma (p=0.0007) but not the CSF.
Reduction of exogenous stress through the introduction of stress-reducing refinements can reduce the variability of data in macaque models (11) . To evaluate if social stress similarly impacts data variability in this SIV-infected pigtailed macaque model, we compared the standard deviations of the post-inoculation data reported 125 herein for socially and singly housed animals. The data from singly housed animals was more variable than the data from socially housed animals ( Fig.4 and S1; p=0.02).
Our data demonstrates that reducing social stress by providing social housing with a compatible conspecific lessens the immune impact of acute SIV infection in a 130 pigtailed macaque model of HIV infection, resulting in a lesser reduction in CD4/CD8 .

This effect is observed while all aspects of infection and care remained consistent between these groups (Table S1 ), effectively removing the sociobehavioral confounders that affect 135 access to care and adherence to treatment inherent in PWH. Thus, this study demonstrates that there is a direct pathophysiologic effect of social stress on pathogenesis of lentiviral infection and that social stress may have implications for pathogenesis of other viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. This analysis has implications beyond primary infection for PWH. The CD4/CD8 140 ratio was lower and CD4 decline greater in singly housed compared to socially housed animals. Lower CD4/CD8 ratio is a predictor of non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality (10) and age-associated disease in PWH (12), while low CD4 counts are a direct prognostic indicator of disease progression throughout infection (13) . Our observation of these negative prognostic indicators in the context of social stress provides additional 145 evidence that social stress directly contributes to negative outcomes. Additionally, latent reservoirs are established during acute infection, remain the major barrier to cure, and are especially difficult to eliminate from sanctuary sites such as the brain (14, 15) . Our findings of higher viral loads in the plasma and CSF in the context of social stress have long-term implications for PWH. These higher viral loads may ultimately originate from 150 the increased CD4 activation that we observed in the singly housed animals, as activated CD4 T cells simultaneously serve as permissive cells for the virus to infect and produce more virus if infected, thus potentiating viral spread and reservoir seeding (16).
Thus, this work provides important evidence that social stress may have a direct PWH have been equivocal, and any impact of social stress on disease progression and health outcomes in PWH is compounded by the fact that social isolation is more .

In sum, social stressors affect immune functioning and thus HIV progression, and robust, controlled studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underpinning these 180 effects on PWH.
Though this study was retrospective, we were able to control for the majority of variables that could have affected our study outcomes (Table S1 ). Variables that were not controlled for in our study design were examined in multivariate post-hoc statistical analyses and found to not influence the conclusions. Importantly to note, there are 185 limitations to the extent that these data can be taken as a representative model for the general population, as only data from juvenile male pigtailed macaques were available.

Macaques are social animals, and housing macaques individually similarly results in physiologic stress.
Otherwise healthy macaques relocated from social to single housing show modulated 205 immune responses for weeks to months thereafter, as demonstrated by lower CD4/CD8 ratios and less robust proinflammatory cytokine responses (36) . Such changes to the immune system driven by social stress have the potential to introduce a confounder into infectious disease studies. Certain psychosocial variables such as social stability lead to an increased risk of mortality from SIV infection (37) . Our data complements the existing 210 literature by demonstrating differences in the immune response and viral loads in singly compared to socially housed SIV-infected macaques. Though we cannot directly demonstrate improvements in translation and reproducibility through this work, the magnitude of the decline in CD4 T cell counts that we observed in socially housed macaques during acute infection (two-fold) is more analogous to that seen in humans 215 during primary HIV infection (38) than the three-fold change observed in singly housed macaques. Further, the decrease in variability of the data generated by our socially housed macaques has implications for study reproducibility. Social housing of macaques is therefore an important refinement that may improve the translational value and reproducibility of data obtained from working with macaque models of HIV infection, 220 and caution must be taken when comparing the data from studies completed in singly and socially housed macaques. Standard deviation for all data sets presented in Figures 1 through 3 were compared in a pairwise fashion between socially and singly housed animals using a Wilcoxon matched pairs 400 signed rank test. *p<0.05.
