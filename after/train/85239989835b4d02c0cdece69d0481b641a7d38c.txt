Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained 23 worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All 24 three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE 25 acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity 26 towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to 27 humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced 28 evolution-population d ynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site 29 mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations 30 selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation 31 of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site 32 substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to 33 optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor 34 usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among 35 CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental 36 to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human 37 and animal pathogens. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae comprises a group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses of 40 clinical and veterinary significance. Adding to the socio-economic impact of coronaviruses (CoVs) 41 already extant in humans and livestock, the emergence of 'new' CoVs through cross species 42 transmission poses an ever-looming threat to public health, animal health, and food production. 43 Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans, but not all of them have become established. The 44 introduction of SARS CoV in 2002 from horseshoe bats with masked palm civets as incidental transient 45 hosts, was rapidly contained through quarantine measures 1 . MERS CoV, natural to dromedary camels, 46 causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human spread 2 . December 2019, a 47 member of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), called 48 SARS-CoV-2 and 79.5% identical to the 2002 SARS CoV variant, emerged in Wuhan, China 3,4 to progress 49
to full scale pandemicity. Chances are, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become established in the human 50 population.
Four other respiratory coronaviruses of zoonotic origin already did succeed in becoming true human 52 viruses with world-wide distribution 5-7 . Among them are HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus, 53 genus Betacoronavirus), related yet distinct viruses that arose from different zoonotic progenitors and 54 entered the human population independently. OC43 is far more related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV), 55 its presumptive ancestor, with early isolates sharing 97% genome identity 8,9 . Together with viruses of 56 swine, canines, equines and lagomorphs, OC43 and BCoV are considered host range variants of the 57 virus species Betacoronavirus-1 (collectively referred to as β1CoVs throughout) 7 . OC43 apparently 58 emerged 70 to 130 years ago from a single cross species transmission event that gave rise to a human-59 only virus [8][9][10] . Like OC43, other β1CoVs also exhibit host specificity 8,11 . While these observations attest 60 to the host promiscuity and zoonotic potential of embecoviruses and β1CoVs in particular, they are 61 also indicative for the existence of host barriers, the breaching of which selects for adaptive mutations 62 that result in host specialization and, ultimately, virus speciation.

Homotrimeric 'peplomers' comprised of spike protein S and extending 20 nm 67 from the viral membrane, mediate virion attachment to entry receptors and membrane fusion 12 . 68 Interspersed are stubby 8-nm homodimeric projections comprised of the hemagglutinin-esterase 69 (HE) 13-15 , a dual function protein typically encompassing a receptor-binding lectin domain specific for 70 O-acetylated sialic acid (O-Ac-Sia) and a receptor destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase domain 16-20 . The 71 HE lectin domain contributes to virion attachment, but at the same time enhances sialate-O-72 acetylesterase activity towards clustered sialoglycotopes 11 . 73 Some embecoviruses, like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and related CoVs in rodents, attach to 4-or 9-74 O-acetylated sialosides (4-or 9-O-Ac-Sias) via HE 21-25 and to a proteinaceous entry receptor via S 26,27 . 75 Others, animal β1CoVs included, bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias via HE 28 but, remarkably, also via S 29,30 or, in the 76 case of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, even exclusively via S 11,31,32 . 77 Structure function analyses of HE and S proteins have yielded a wealth of data on ligand binding, 78 substrate selection and protein-glycan interactions. The receptor binding sites (RBSs) of CoV HE lectin 79 domains and those in related proteins of toro-and influenza C/D viruses 22,33-35 differ in sequence and 80 structure yet conform to a common architectural design with a deep hydrophobic pocket ('P1') to 81 accommodate the crucial sialate-O-acetyl moiety, and an adjacent pocket or depression ('P2') to 82 accept the 5-N-acyl group 17,21,22,33 . Characteristically, P1 and P2 are separated by an aromatic side 83 chain and binding of the ligand is stabilized further through electrostatic protein-glycan interactions 84 typically involving distinctive Sia functions such as the Sia glycerol side chain, the 5-N-Acyl and/or the 85 Sia carboxylate. The RBS for 9-O-Ac-Sia in the S proteins of BCoV and OC43, identified by comparative 86 structural analysis 32 and confirmed by the cryo-EM holostructure of OC43 S 36 , conforms to this 87 blueprint. Moreover, this site is structurally and functionally conserved in HKU1 32 . : bioRxiv preprint 5 Much less is known about the functional relationship between S and HE, and the role of HE in particular 89 remains poorly understood. In MHV, HE expression is dispensable for replication and rapidly lost 90 during cell culture propagation 15 . Conversely, in β1CoVs, HE seems critical for infection. In OC43, loss 91 of HE-associated acetyl esterase activity abrogates the production of infectious virus and virus 92 dissemination in cell culture 37 . Moreover, acetyl-esterase inhibitors impede BCoV replication 19 , and 93 antibodies against HE neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo 38-40 . Still, even among β1CoVs there are 94 differences in HE function apparently correlating with host specificity. Whereas HE lectin activity is 95 strictly maintained in BCoV 28 , OC43 lost this function through progressive accumulation of mutations 96 in the HE RBS, apparently as an adaptation to replication in the human respiratory tract 11 . 97 Nevertheless, isolates of either virus propagate in cultured cells. To better understand the 98 consequences of loss of HE lectin function as it occurred during OC43 and also HKU1 evolution, we 99 took a reverse genetics/forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model. The findings reveal that HE 100 and S are functionally interdependent and that the acquisition of HE by a proto-embecovirus allowed 101 its β1CoV descendants to adopt strategies for reversible virion-sialoglycan attachment, remarkably 102 similar to those of influenza A viruses. RESULTS 104 Disruption of HE lectin function selects for mutations in S. To study the role and importance of HE in 105 β1CoV propagation, we developed a reverse genetics system for BCoV strain Mebus (sFig. 1A) based 106 on targeted RNA recombination 41,42 . Recombinant 'wildtype' BCoVs (rBCoV) with parental type HE and 107 S, but with accessory ORF4a replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (rBCoV-Rluc), were readily 108 generated upon seeding acceptor-virus-infected, donor RNA-transfected mouse LR7 cells onto 109 monolayers of feeder HRT18 cells. rBCoV-Rluc arose and within seven days grew to final titers 110 routinely obtained for wildtype BCoV (~10 8 TCID50/ml). 111 Generating BCoV-Rluc derivatives defective in HE lectin function proved more cumbersome. To 112 abolish the HE RBS, we substituted Phe 211 , which is key to ligand binding 17 (sFig. 1B), by Ala via two 113 nucleotide substitutions to block reversion. Mutant viruses were recovered eventually, but, in 3 out 114 of 4 successful trials, a multistep 160-hr rescue did not suffice and an additional 72-96 hr blind passage 115
was required (Fig. 1A) . 116 Sequence analysis of clonal virus populations, obtained by endpoint dilution, confirmed the presence 117 of the HE Phe 211 Ala substitution in all cases. Surprisingly, the purified viruses all suffered single site 118 mutations in S, clustering in domain S1 A (aa 15-302) in proximity of the RBS (Figs. 1A-C; sFig. 2). Two 119 of the trials yielded multiple S variants and some variants -Thr 83 Ile and Leu 89 Pro-emerged 120 independently in separate experiments (Fig. 1A) . The mutations map to three distinct S RBS elements 121 (Fig. 1C, sFig. 2C ; nomenclature according to 32 ). Ile 26 Ser and Asn 27 Ser locate in the S1 A β1 element 122 within the N-terminal L1-β1-L2 segment (aa 15-33) that walls pocket P1; P1 is crucial for ligand binding 123 as it accommodates the all-important sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety 32,36 . Moreover, in the OC43 S cryo-EM 124 holostructure, the Asn 27 side chain hydrogen bonds with the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl 36 . Leu 89 Pro in S1 A 125 element 3101 is immediately adjacent to Trp 90 . The latter is arguably the most critical residue in the 126 RBS as its indole side chain separates the P1 and P2 pockets, and its replacement precludes receptor-127 binding and virus infectivity 32 . Finally, Gly 82 Glu and Thr 83 Ile substitutions occurred in S1 A element β5 128 that interacts with the sialate carboxylate through hydrogen bonding with Lys 81 and Thr 83 . : bioRxiv preprint 7 As measured by solid phase lectin binding assay (sp-LBA) with S1 A -Fc fusion proteins and bovine 130 submaxillary mucin (BSM) as ligand, all mutations significantly reduced S binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia albeit 131 to widely different extents. S1 A -Fc binding affinities of the mutants were 500-fold (Asn 27 Ser) to more 132 than 10.000-fold (Ile 26 Ser; Gly 82 Glu) lower than that of parental BCoV S1 A -Fc (Fig. 1D) . 133 Loss of the HE lectin RBS would both abolish HE-assisted virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sia receptor 134 determinants as well as reduce virion-associated receptor-destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase activity 135 towards clustered glycotopes 11 . The findings suggest that the HE-Phe 211 Ala substitution creates a 136 fitness defect that can be alleviated not by increasing but by dramatically reducing the affinity of the 137 S RBS. Thus, the defect apparently is caused by loss of virion-associated RDE activity rather than by 138 loss of overall virion avidity.
139
140 downregulation of HE esterase activity consequential to loss of lectin function, could affect virus 141 propagation at two stages of the infectious cycle, namely virus release, which would require depletion 142 of intracellular and cell surface receptor pools, and (pre)attachment. We recently reported that G-143 deficient vesicular stomatitis (VSV) virions pseudotyped with wildtype BCoV S require exogenous HE 144
for efficient infection 32 . S1 A mutations that reduce S affinity inhibit infection, but, as we now show, 145 only when HE is present. VSV virions pseudotyped with low affinity mutant S proteins were less reliant 146 on or even inhibited by exogenous HE with decreasing S RBS affinity (Fig. 1E) . The findings provide 147 direct proof that the S1 A mutations act at the level of virion attachment and support the notion that 148 the S1 A mutations, selected for in HE-defective rBCoVs, restore reversibility of receptor binding by 149 lowering S affinity and thereby protect against inadvertent attachment to decoy receptors. 150 HE lectin-deficient recombinant BCoVs are genetically stable when grown in the presence of 151 exogenous receptor-destroying enzyme. To test whether loss of virion-associated RDE activity in 152
rBCoV-HE-F 211 A/S wt /Rluc might be compensated for by adding exogenous soluble HE to the culture 153 medium, we seeded infected/transfected LR7 cells onto HRT18 cell monolayers, supplemented the 154 author/funder.

Sanger sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons showed that all viruses cloned by endpoint dilution 162 of the 160-hr stock (n=4) coded for mutant HE-Phe 211 Ala in combination with wildtype S1 A . To assess 163 the stability of clonal rBCoV-HE-F 211 A/S wt /Rluc, the virus population resulting from a subsequent 120-164 hr amplification in the presence of exogenous HE-Fc was analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing 165 (NGS), which allows for the detection of low frequency mutants. Sequence variation in HE and S1 A was 166 distributed randomly and did not exceed background levels (<0.15%). More than 99.5% of the viruses 167 coded for HE-Phe 211 Ala, while preserving parental type S1 A (Fig. 2B) .
168
169 among S affinity variants. With a clonal, virtually pure stock of rBCoV-HE-F 211 A/S wt available, we 170 performed controlled forced evolution experiments. The virus was serially passaged involving three 171 consecutive 120-hr multistep propagation rounds in HRT18 cells but now in the absence of exogenous 172 HE-Fc, with the initial infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 (Fig. 2C) . In trial 1, viral titers 173 in passage 1 (p1) increased only slowly to 3 x 10 4 and 2 x 10 4 TCID50/ml (measured with or without 174 exogenous HE-Fc, respectively). The withdrawal of exogenous RDE during viral passage immediately 175 selected for mutations in S1 A . Virus cloning by endpoint dilution of the 120-hr p1 sample yielded S RBS 176 mutants Asn 27 Ser, Thr 83 Ile and Ile 26 Ser (Fig. 2C ) -all three of which had been seen before (Fig. 1A) . 177 NGS analysis revealed the true complexity of the p1 population (Fig. 2C) and identified two additional 178 S1 A variants with substitutions -His 173 Tyr and Arg 197 Cys-more distal from the RBS (sFigs. 2D, 3A, B) . 179 His 173 Tyr also reduced the relative binding affinity of S1 A -Fc albeit less dramatically than the other 180 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint 9 mutations, namely by 30-fold ( Table 1) . The Arg 197 Cys mutation seemingly falls in a separate category 181 as it reduced S1 A -Fc expression levels by more than 90% suggestive of defective folding (sFig. 3C). 182 Apparently, aberrant disulfide-bonding causes most of the fusion protein to be retained in the ER with 183 only a minor, presumably properly folded fraction slipping through to become secreted.
All in all, the p1 population was comprised for virtually 100% of HE-Phe 211 Ala mutants, 40% of which 185 in combination with parental BCoV S, the remaining 60% with second-site mutations in S1 A ( Fig. 2C; 186 Table 1 ). Of the latter, the ultra-low affinity variant S1 A -Ile 26 Ser was the most abundant at 46% and 187 the Asn 27 Ser variant the least at less than 1%. However, upon a subsequent round of 120-hr multistep 188 propagation, the tables were turned with S1 A -Asn 27 Ser now comprising almost 40% of the p2 189 population and the Ile 26 Ser variant reduced to 0.7%. In addition, four other S1 A variants emerged. One 190 of these had a mutation in S1 A RBS loop L1, Val 29 Gly, and a relative binding affinity close to that of the 191 Asn 27 Ser mutant ( Fig. 2C; Table 1 ). We also identified at position 75 a second S1 A Cys-substitution 192 mutant, which like Arg 197 Cys, presumably disrupts the RBS through aberrant disulfide bonding (sFig. 193 3). Remarkably, two other S1 A variants arose with mutations -Arg 88 Thr and Pro 174 Leu-that affected 194 the relative binding affinity only modestly to 0.25 and 0.5 of that of wildtype S1 A -Fc, respectively 195 ( Table 1) . Even more remarkably, upon further passage these mutants increased to dominate the p3 196 population, effectively outcompeting variants with low affinity spikes as well as those with parental 197 spikes (Fig. 2C, D) . However, when the p1, p2 and p3 stocks were cloned by endpoint dilution in the 198 absence of exogenous HE-Fc, only virus variants with low affinity mutations in S1 A were isolated (Fig. 
cell culture supernatant with BCoV HE-Fc 17 to final concentrations of 1 pg to 10 μg/ml, and allowed 155 infection to proceed for 120 hr. While in the absence of HE-Fc there was no sign of virus propagation 156 as detectable by IFA, concentrations of exogenous sialate-O-acetylesterase as low as 1 ng/ml to up to frequency in p3. As a result of this mutation, HE lectin affinity was regained albeit to levels solely 207 detectable by high-sensitivity nanobead hemagglutination assay, while esterase activity towards 208 clustered glycotopes in BSM increased 4-fold as compared to HE-Phe 211 Ala, but still remained 125-fold 209 lower than that of wildtype HE (sFig. 4). Apparently, the increase in HE function, minor as it may be, 210 provides a selective advantage, but apparently one that benefits both low and high affinity S variants, 211 because the mutation was found in cloned viruses of either type. 3.4 x 10 7 TCID50/ml, when measured in the presence or absence of exogenous HE-Fc, respectively.
217 Surprisingly, in stark contrast to trial 1, the trial 2 p1 population was comprised for about 94% of 218 viruses expressing wildtype BCoV S. Less than 6% consisted of variants with mutations in S1 A , four of 219 low receptor binding affinity (Thr 22 Ile, Asn 27 Tyr, Val 29 Gly, His 173 Tyr), one of near-wildtype binding 220 affinity (Pro 174 Leu), and, with the exception of Thr 22 Ile, all at positions seen before (Tables 1, 2) . 221 Consistent with our previous findings, however, virus purification through endpoint dilution in the 222 absence of exogenous HE-Fc yielded low affinity mutants (11/11 tested) exclusively (sFig. 5). If the 223 variants in the trial 2 p1 population were all of equal replicative fitness under the conditions applied, 224 the odds of this result would be less than 1.10 -12 . 225 At first glance, the two trials would seem to differ in their outcomes. We offer, however, that the 226 results are in fact consonant and that the main difference is in the speed with which the virus 227 populations increased and evolved. There is an inherent stochastic element to the experimental 228 approach and whether the developing quasispecies undergoes slow track (experiment 1) or fast track 229 evolution (experiment 2) is likely dependent on the time of advent of the first mutant virus and its 230 properties, for instance whether it is an ultralow (like Ile 26 Ser) or low affinity variant (like Asn 27 Ser).

At least, the uptake of S-Arg 197 Cys into VSV pseudotypes was not 243 noticeably impaired as compared to that of wildtype S (sFig. 3E). Still, the mutation did alter the 244 infectivity of the pseudotyped particles making them less dependent on exogenous HE-Fc (sFig. 3F) 245 presumably by reducing the avidity of S trimers through local S1 A misfolding and consequential 246 disruption of the RBS in one or more monomers. (iv) Perhaps most surprisingly, quasispecies 247 developed in which loss of HE lectin function was compensated at the level of the viral population 248 with minority low affinity variants, constituting less than 6% of the swarm, not only sustaining the 249 replication of high affinity variants but actually allowing the latter to flourish and amplify to become 250 the majority phenotype.
S and HE proteins co-evolve to attain functional balance and optimal virion avidity. Among the first 252 mutations fixed upon zoonotic introduction and early emergence of OC43, was a HE-Thr 114 Asn 253 substitution, which created a glycosylation site at the rim of the lectin domain RBS 11 (Fig. 3A) . Glycans The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.003699 doi: bioRxiv preprint analysis of the virus swarm arising after targeted recombination showed the glycosylation site to be 259 destroyed but only in 10% of the population and exclusively by Ser 116 Phe substitution (Fig. 3D) . This 260 mutation partially restores HE receptor binding and receptor destruction to 0.125 and 0.17 of that of 261 wildtype HE, respectively (Fig. 3B, C) . In the vast majority of viruses, the newly introduced HE 262 glycosylation site was retained and, instead, S1 A mutations that reduced S affinity were selected again, 263 with S-RBS Thr 83 replaced either by Ile (69%) -as seen before (Figs. 1A, 2C; Table 1 )-or by Asn (10%) 264 (Fig. 3D) . The latter mutation reduces S1 A affinity to 0.008 of that of wildtype.
Virus cloning by endpoint dilution yielded, in three out of five isolates, S1 A -Thr 83 Asn variants with the 266 newly introduced N-glycosylation site in HE intact (HE-Thr 114 Asn). Furthermore, a single S1 A -Thr 83 Ile 267 variant was isolated, but this virus in addition had the N-glycosylation site in HE destroyed (HE-
Thr 114 Asn/Ser 116 Phe) (Fig. 3D) . The observations led us to entertain the possibility that the mutations 269 in S1 A and HE did not occur independently and that, even in viruses expressing low affinity spikes, 270 partially restorative mutations in HE would yet provide a selective advantage. To test this, the clonal 271 S1 A -Thr 83 Asn/HE-Thr 114 Asn variants were serially passaged. All three viruses independently lost HE 272 Asn 114 glycosylation over time and, saliently, through Ser 116 Phe substitution exclusively. Even more 273 remarkably, with HE-Ser 116 Phe mutants gaining dominance, variants emerged that had restored S 274 affinity to (near)wildtype through substitution of S1 A -Asn 83 either by Thr or by Ser (Fig. 3E) . 275 For one of the five clonal populations obtained by endpoint dilution, we unfortunately failed to 276 determine its genotype for technical reasons. From the NGS analysis of the p1 population, we deduced 277 that the starting mutant must have been a low affinity S1 A -Leu 89 Pro variant that, like the S1 A -278 Thr 83 Asn/Ile variants described above, quickly lost the HE-Asn 114 glycan through an HE-Ser 116 Phe 279 substitution. Oddly enough, the Leu 89 Pro substitution had not been detected by NGS in the pre-cloning 280 virus stock. Note, however, that this mutation had been selected before twice independently in trials 281 with rBCoV-HE-F 211 A ( Table 2) . Possibly, it arose spontaneously during end point dilution procedure.
Be that as it may, its in vitro evolution proved informative (Fig. 4A) . NGS analysis of a passage p1 283 population, resulting from 120-hr multistep propagation, showed that 100% of the viruses coded for 284 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Apparently, this created an 382 HE-S disbalance that in turn favored the selection of viruses with revertant mutations in S that raised 383 S RBS affinity again to wildtype (Thr 83 → Ile → Thr; Leu 89 → Pro → Leu) or near wildtype levels (Thr 83 → Ile 384 → Ser; Leu 89 → Pro→ Thr/Ser).
