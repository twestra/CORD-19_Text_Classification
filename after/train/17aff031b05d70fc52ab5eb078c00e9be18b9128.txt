Coronavirus disease 2019 has become pandemic, causing more than 1.5 million infections and over ten-thousands of deaths in a short period of time worldwide.
However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and reports on clinical study on specific treatment are few.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in COVID-19 patients.
Coronavirus disease-2019(COVID- 19) is a systemic infectious disease mainly caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while critical COVID-19 is a life-threatening multi-organ dysfunction syndrome dysregulated resulted from host response to SARS-CoV-2 and characterized by refractory hypoxemia caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] . From December 2019 to April 2020, more than 80,000 people in China infected SARS-CoV-2, and in which, over 3,000 people died. Globally, more than 1.5 million people infected SARS-CoV-2 and near 100,000 people died, including a large number of health workers, which has become the most serious problem faced by all medical staff and researchers [2, 3] . According to the reports, the general mortality was about 1%-15% in all COVID-19 cases, and the incidence of critical COVID-19, including both severe and critical types defined by
Infection published by National Health Commission of China (Trial 7th Version), is about 10%-20%, and its mortality was about 30%-60% [4, 5] .
It is currently believed that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infect the lungs, and subsequently cause systemic inflammation and immune response disorder, and ultimately lead to multiple organ injury and even death [6] . However, effective therapeutic method is lacking.
The available clinical treatment strategies to critical COVID-19 are mainly antiviral and oxygen therapy, as well as organ and symptomatic support, including mechanical ventilation, even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) of cardiopulmonary support, and continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) [7] . However, the clinical efficacy of these strategies is still uncertain. Some clinical tests and autopsy results suggested that the .

Targeted intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is one of the main treatment measures [4, 7] . However, due to the lack of clinical trials, the efficacy of IVIG has yet to be determined and clinical application is still controversial.
Human Immunoglobulin (pH4) for intravenous injection is a liquid preparation containing human immunoglobulins made from normal human plasma, containing IgG antibody with broadspectrum antiviral, bacterial or other pathogens. IVIG can rapidly increase the IgG level in the blood, directly neutralize exogenous antigens, and regulate multiple immune functions, including regulating immune media, and improving the immune capacity of natural immune cells and lymphocytes. IVIG has been wildly used in the treatment of severe bacterial and viral infection and sepsis [10, 11] . Some studies demonstrated its clinical efficacy, especially in the case of viral infectious diseases [12] ; whereas, other studies failed to show its therapeutic efficacy, leading to great controversy on its clinical application in acute respiratory virus infection [13] . The latest version of China therapeutic guidelines of COVID-19 suggested IVIG as a selective treatment method. However, due to lacking specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of IVIG remains to be elucidated. It is noticed that use of IVIG is recommendation in the list of selective methods in the COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines of WHO [4, 7, 14, 15] .
In order to confirm the potential therapeutic efficacy of IVIG to COVID-19, we retrospective collected the clinical and outcome data of critical COVID-19 patients, including both severe type and critical type, from 8 government designated treatment centers in three cities (Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) in China, and using IVIG as an exposure factor analyzed the symptoms and outcomes. Up to date, this is the first clinical multicenter cohort study on .

We designed the data collection form, which includes the demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory data and prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records. Detailed clinical data before and after prescription IVIG, and the data at the corresponding time of the same period in non-IVIG group were collected, respectively. Whether and when to use IVIG, dosage and course were decided by the doctors in charge. Comparison was conducted according to whether IVIG was used or not. Primary endpoint was 28-day and 60-day in hospital mortality, and total in-hospital days and the total duration of the disease as the secondary endpoint.
Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation and organ function were measured. The influencing factors were determined by COX regression. Analysis of the outcome and the survival curves were carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage, and timing. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA (HE-2020-08) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission.
"Critical COVID-19" in this article is defined as combined term of "Severe type" and "Critical type" of COVID-19, classified following Chinese Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (SARSCoV2) infection (Trial 7th version) published by National Health Commission of China.

IVIG rapidly increases the level of IgG in the blood of the recipient after intravenous infusion, and enhance the anti-infection ability and immune regulation function of the body.
The categorical data were summarized as numbers and percentages, and inter-group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U, χ 2 tests or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were expressed as the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD) or as the median and interquartile range, depending on whether or not they showed a gaussian distribution.
Continuous data with gaussian distribution were compared with the Student's t test or one-way ANOVA and those with a non-gaussian distribution, with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To compare the white blood cell, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocyte count between IGIV and non-IGIV groups. To determine the independent effect of 60-day mortality in critical COVID-19 patients after accounting for significant confounders, COX proportional hazards model was used with fully adjusted model: OR (odds ratio) and 95% confidence interval levels (95% CI).
Moreover, for analysis of the 28-day and 60-day mortality, Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves and the Log-Rank Test were used. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS Windows version 11.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), P values (two-tailed) below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Clinical data of 338 patients were collected with confirmed critical COVID-19. After excluding 13 patients due to missing key information, 325 patients were included in the final analysis ( Figure 1 ). The detailed demographic and clinical profile data of all critical ill patients with COVID-19 on baseline were summarized in Table 1 . Patient's mean age was 58 ys (IQR 46.0-69.0), mean body temperature was 37.0°C (IQR 36.5-37.8). Nearly half of the patients had comorbidity, mainly hypertension (30%), diabetes (12%) and coronary heart disease (10%). 222 (68%) were severe type and 103 (32%) were critical type. 174 cases used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Comparisons of baseline characteristics between two groups showed that the disease was more severe in the IVIG group, presented by older age, higher APACHII scores and SOFA scores, higher levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, c-reactive protein, IL-6, and lactate, but lower platelets and lymphocyte count (all P<0.05), and decreased PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P=0.011, Table 1 ).

In IVIG group 22 (13%) died within 28-day, total 33 (19%) died in 60-day. In non-IVIG group 20 (13%) died within 28-day, total 21 (14%) died in 60-day. There was no significant difference in 28-day and 60-day mortality between the IVIG group and non- . Compared between the two groups, the in hospital day and total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (both P < 0.001, table 2), and the number of lymphocytes was still lower (P < 0.001), CRP was still higher (P = 0.011, supplementary table 1), which is consistent with the more serious initial condition of IVIG group.
In order to correct the bias of the difference between the two groups' basic conditions on the prognosis, multivariable COX regression analysis was performed with gender, age, comorbidity, APACHE II score, SOFA score, temperature, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, creatinine, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , lactic acid, clinical classification of COVID-19, and IVIG use. It was found that lower lymphocyte count associated with more severe COVID-19 classification and a higher 60-day mortality, while, application of IVIG significantly decreased the 60-day mortality (HR 0.252; 95% CI 0.107-0.591; P=0.002, Table 3 ).

According to the results of multivariate analysis, deep analysis was carried out in different subgroups. The results showed that IVIG could significantly decrease the 28-day mortality of patients in critical type (P=0.009) but had no effects on the 60-day mortality and in-hospital stay (both P>0.05, Table 4 ). In addition, IVIG also significantly decreased the procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid levels in critical type patients (P < 0.05, supplementary Table 2 ), suggesting that IVIG decreases the inflammatory response and may improve microcirculation perfusion.
However, in the severe type patients, there was no difference in mortality between IVIG group and non IVIG group (P> 0.05), and the length of in-hospital stay in IVIG group was not changed (Table 4) . Moreover, there was no difference in the 60-day survival rate between the two groups (supplementary Figure 2 and 3).
Further analyses were performed with APACHII score (> 11 and ≦ 11), PaO 2 / FiO 2 (> 100 and ≦ 100), lymphocyte count (≦0.8×10 9 /L and >0.8×10 9 /L), and SOFA score (≦6 and > 6), and the results showed that there were no differences in 28-day, 60-day mortality between IVIG and non IVIG groups (supplementary Table 3 ). In the comparison of parameters of inflammation response and organ function, IVIG significantly decreases PCT level and improves PaO 2 /FiO 2 (both P< 0.05, supplementary CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Further comparison between the subgroups with different COVID-19 types showed that high dose IVIG of more than 15 g/d could significantly reduce the 28-day and 60-day mortality of the critical type patients (P = 0.002, P < 0.0001, perspective, Table 6 ), and increase the survival time (P < 0.0001, supplementary Table 6 ).
To further confirm the effects of IVIG application timing on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients, subgroup with the time from admission to the beginning of IVIG treatment (>7 d and ≤ 7 d admission ) were compared, and the results showed that early administration of IVIG (≤ 7d) could significantly reduce 60-day mortality (P= 0.008, Table 7 ), total in-hospital stay, and total course of disease (P=0.025 and P=0.005, respectively), and significantly increase survival time (supplementary Figure 7) . Further analysis showed that early use of IVIG could also significantly increase PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P= 0.022) and decrease levels of PCT (P=0.016), IL-6, and CRP (supplementary Table 7 ), suggesting that early use of IVIG is potentially able to improve inflammatory response and some organ functions.

The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading all over the world, resulting in over one hundred thousand global death due to lacking well-established treatment. To our knowledge, this multicenter retrospective cohort study is the first clinical evaluation, with a large number of cases, on the efficiency of IVIG treatment to critical COVID-19 patients. The basic condition of patients in IVIG group was more serious. The results showed that, for the critical COVID-19 patients, IVIG has no effect on the 28-day and 60-day mortality. Notably, multivariable regression showed that both classification of COVID-19 and IVIG using were the factors that related with hazards ratios of death. Subgroup analysis showed that only in the critical type patients IVIG could significantly decrease the inflammatory response, improve some organ functions, reduce the 28-day mortality rate, and prolong the survival time. Furthermore, the study showed that early use of IVIG (admission≤ 7 days) with high dose (>15 g/d) exhibits more significantly curative effect. Noteworthy, the results indicated that early and high dose of author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Previous studies in the treatment of SARS and MERS suggested beneficial role for high dose immunoglobulin administration [16, 17] . Since immunoglobulin was not the specific antibody to any virus and the clinical evidence for its efficacy was limited, some researchers held the oppose view about usage of immunoglobulin in acute virus infection [18, 19] . In COVID-19 treatment guidance of China and WHO, the recommendation on immunoglobulin usage is different. The data from the current study showed that IVIG did not improve the outcome in overall enrolled critical COVID-19 patients. However, the multivariable regression and subgroup analysis showed that IVIG could only improve the prognosis in the critical type patients. One explanation was that severe type cases with lower organ injury and mortality, which is similar with previous study.
The recommended dose of immunoglobulin is 0.5 g/kg·d for 5 days. However, in the present study, the doses used differ among the different centers and physicians, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 g/kg·d. The treatment period ranged from 5 to 15 days. By subgroup analysis, we found that only high dose over 15 g/d (equivalent to 0.2-0.3g/kg.d) shows the curative effect, which is consistent with the usage of immunoglobulin in treating sepsis only effectively in high dose [20] .
High dose of immunoglobulin would be able to rapidly increase its concentration in circulation by 3-to 6-fold and play a role in enhancing immunity and antiviral function.
The current study suggests the importance of early use of immunoglobulin in the COVID-19 patients. Immunoglobulin affects both innate and adapted immune systems, and directly binds to pathogen antigen, which usually appears in the circulation in an early stage following virus infection [21, 22, 23] .

Our data showed that immunoglobulin employed within 7 days after hospital admission could improve the prognosis. And we found that patients in enrolled with IVIG group were in more severe condition, evidenced by higher APACHE II and SOFA scores, higher levels of IL-6 and lactate, as well as decreased lymphocyte count and oxygenation index in this multicenter retrospective study.
Compared to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 demonstrates several exceptionalities, including prolonged course, potential asymptomatic hypoxia, severe lung injury, and unexpected progress induced death [4, 5, 24 ]. These clinical features urgently call for exploratory treatment attempts. IVIG is one of the such attempts. To exclude the influence of the bias on the study, we performed the regression analysis on the potential factors. Univariate survival analysis showed that APACHE II and SOFA sores were the risk factor which related with the outcome. In further analysis, we found APACHE II and SOFA scores were relatively low in most enrolled patients. This is consisted with the characteristics of this disease, i.e., only in the patients with severe lung injury, but few other organs injury. COX regression confirmed that critical type COVID-19 patients showed poor prognosis and IVIG improved their survival rate. Although IVIG does not show therapeutic effect on the whole cohort, it can be beneficial to the critical type patients. In addition, COX regression also showed that lymphopenia was the risk of poor prognosis. This observation is consistent with the previous study reported that 35%-83% COVID-19 patients showed lymphocyte count decreased, and persistent lymphopenia was related with the poor outcome [26]. However, subgroup analysis based on the lymphocyte counts did not show an .

The explanation is uncertain yet. Future study on the role of IVIG in regulating lymphocyte number and function is needed.
There are some limitations in present study. Firstly, the cases from these eight clinical centers may still lack sufficient representativeness. Secondly, the dose and timing of IVIG administration in each center may not be exactly consistent. And thirdly, limited by the clinical workload and situation, the evaluation of immunoglobulin effect is mainly based on the clinical manifestations, rather than direct cellular and molecular assessment, including viral load and lymphocyte activation. With the progression in recognition of COVID-19, large cases randomized control studies and more developed evaluation systems are needed to confirm the efficiency of IVIG on COVID-19 treatment.
In conclusion, the present study is the first clinical research evaluating the efficiency of IVIG treatment to critical COVID-19 patients. The data demonstrate that early application of high dose IVIG can improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with critical type. This study provides important information on clinical application of IVIG in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including patient selection and administration timing and dosage.
