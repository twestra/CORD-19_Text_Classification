11 Background: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health 12 Organization (WHO) on March 11 th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal 13 behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current 14 knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its correlation with 15 different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, 22 seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed 23 in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability 24 and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on 25 the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and 26 thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was 27 graded as low for both outcomes evaluated.

On the other hand, several meteorological factors combined together could describe the epidemic trend much better than single-factor models. Significant impact of daily mean temperature on the daily confirmed new case counts 14 days later. It is supposed that a sufficient time delay between exposure and confirmation is crucial for weather to exhibit its effect. There are relatively narrow temperature and humidity ranges for SARS-CoV-2 spread, there is an optimal temperature for SARS-CoV-2 at 8.07 â„ƒ and most cities with high epidemic transmission of COVID-19 are located in the humidity range of 60% ~ 90%. The results suggest that temperature has a huge effect on how rapidly the SARS-CoV-2 spreads during certain conditions. The author recommends that southern hemisphere countries prepare for increasing caseload, and northern hemisphere countries limit air conditioning. Great heterogeneity was observed in relation to the displayed variables, that included other weather conditions beyond temperature and humidity [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] like wind speed, [20, 32] visibility, [24] precipitation, [25, 27] pressure, [20] rainfall rate, [20] snowfall rate, [20] snow depth, [20] surface downward short-wave irradiation. [20] A heterogeneity was also observed regarding the date of data collection, both in relation to the location studied, and the date of epidemiological data collection of COVID-19 and climatic conditions.
Great homogeneity was observed in the results of the effect of temperature and humidity in the seasonal variability and spread of the virus. Sixteen articles selected for final analysis [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [33] [34] [35] were unanimous in stating that cool and dry conditions were potentiating factors for the spread of COVID-19, with the spread being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wet conditions. Only one article reported no strong effect of temperature and humidity in the spread of the virus. [32] It was also noticed that several meteorological factors combined could better describe the epidemic trend than when a single variable was analyzed. [21, 24] In addition, confounding factors as public health policies on surveillance and containment, social isolation campaigns (home quarantine strategy), including with patients' families, socioeconomic development contributes to controlling the spread of the virus around the world. [9, 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 31, 33, 35] Moreover, controlling population density (less crowded cities) [30] and movement, [24] travel limitations, [26, 28] increasing the number of medical staff and hospitals, isolating all the suspected cases, understanding the method of each patient's infection, combining the medical history of the patients with current diagnosis to extract information about the virus, [20] are important measures to combat the new coronavirus.
It was verified, in countries with virus transmission under control like Korea, that the widespread testing to identify potential COVID-19 positive subjects, including asymptomatic ones, could reduce transmission. [23] Regarding the review process, ten of the selected articles have not yet gone through the peer review process. This must be taken into consideration when making any inference from their conclusion. [9, [20] [21] [22] 24, [26] [27] [28] 31, 35] All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064923 doi: medRxiv preprint After considering all these factors, we can infer that confounding variables play an important role, even more significant than temperature and relative humidity, in the spread of COVID-19.
A meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of the methods, locations, and information provided in the related articles investigating the proposed objectives. Additionally, differing units of measure, variables and statistical methods did not allow meaningful comparisons. Only simple and descriptive comparisons were reported, beyond the risk of bias and narrative grade of evidence of the results.
The risk of bias ranged from high in four papers [9, 22, 27, 32] to moderate in the remaining thirteen (Table 4 ). [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [28] [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] Limitations were observed in the main items evaluated. Inability to satisfy "the criteria for inclusion in the sample" and "the study subjects and the setting described" items resulted in the low grade, since a limitation in the sample selection criteria meant that none of the studies received a positive evaluation. In addition, many "confounding factors" like public health interventions by the government can interfere with the real effect of the variables studied -temperature and humidity -on the spread of the virus. These factors were only identified in five of the thirteen selected articles. [25, 27, 28, 31, 33] In contrast, the items "the exposure measured", "the outcomes measured" and "the objective, the standard criteria used for measurement of the condition" were, in most articles, performed in a valid and reliable way, except for Oliveiros [27] in all of these three items, Bhattacharjee [32] and AraÃºjo [9] in item "the outcomes measured", Al-Rousan [20] and Bannister-Tyrrell [21] regarding item "the objective, the standard criteria used for measurement of the condition".

The evaluation of the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE is described in Table 5 . The level of certainty of outcomes evaluated in this systematic review -"Association between temperature and spread rate of COVID-19" and "Association between humidity and spread rate of COVID-19"were classified as "low". Since the studies are observational and presented a considerable risk of bias, the certainty of the evidence generated received this classification. Moreover, one study did not show a significant effect of the variables under study on the spread of the new coronavirus. [32] All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Of the seventeen articles evaluated, sixteen showed some effect of temperature on the transmission rate. Except for one, which concluded that temperature has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the other sixteen found that warmer climates are less likely to spread the virus. When other variables are included in the analysis, such as migration patterns, public isolation policies, population density, and cultural aspects, the temperature seems to have less impact.
Association between humidity and spread rate of COVID-19
Fourteen manuscripts that investigated the effect of humidity on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated an association between variables. Only one article reported no effect of humidity on the spread of the virus, while the other fourteen showed that wetter climates inhibit the virus spread. As with the temperature, the adjustment for confounding factors decreases the impact of humidity on the transmission of COVID-19.
The studies used secondary data obtained through websites for both the number of infected and the climatic conditions. Therefore, eligibility criteria to control possible confounding factors have not been adopted. Furthermore, several studies did not consider variables such as migration patterns and isolation policies in their results, factors that directly impact on the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.
The results of the articles included in this systematic review indicate that the spread of COVID-19 may be influenced by climatic variables such as temperature and humidity. Apparently, warmer and humid climates may show less transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the level of evidence generated was low, due to the observational design of the studies and the inherent risk of bias, overall great homogeneity of the results was observed among the included studies.
Furthermore, the spread of types of diseases caused by betacoronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-1[11] and MERS-CoV, [36] have already been shown to suffer the impact of climatic conditions. In both these coronoviruses, hot and humid climates demonstrated the ability to decrease the viability of these viruses, while in places with low temperature and humidity there was greater viral stability.
Seventeen articles were included in this systematic review, and methodological issues were identified. Regarding the classification of the articles and their score evaluated by the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist tool, [18] thirteen studies were classified as moderate risk of bias, [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [28] [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] and four as high risk of bias. [9, 22, 27, 32] This was due, among other factors, to limitations in the sample selection criteria, once the main items "the criteria for inclusion in the sample" and "the study subjects and the setting described" received a negative rating in all selected articles. A reasonable explanation for this fact would be that due to the urgency of the world situation with the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide and the need to search for immediate responses to contain the pandemic, secondary data available was used at the moment that the studies were realized, both in relation to the epidemiology of the new coronavirus, and to the climatic conditions, in an attempt to verify a possible association between them.
Because of this, there was a limitation in the sample selection criteria and the confounding factors that could interfere with the analysis of these secondary data were not controlled by the eligibility criteria.
The quality of evidence of clinical outcomes was also graded using the GRADE tool. The evidence was scored as low because of the study designs, classified as observational cross-sectional studies, due to the effect of other confounding variables on temperature and humidity in the spread of the virus, and because one selected article did not find a positive strong association between the spread of the new coronavirus with temperature and humidity.

[32] However, due to homogeneity in the results, which indicate, in summary, that cool and dry conditions were potential factors to the spread of COVID-19, and warmer and wetter climates are less likely to enhance the transmissibility of the virus, the level of evidence could not be rated lower than that.
The analyses of COVID-19 outbreaks in relation to meteorology aspects reveal significant correlations between the incidence of positive cases and climatic conditions. Social factors in combination with meteorological factors play a role in coronavirus outbreaks. [37, 38] In fifteen included studies, [9, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [32] [33] [34] [35] the authors investigate the association between temperature and humidity in the transmission rate of COVID-19.
In the other two articles, [21, 31] the association was made only with temperature.
Luo et al. [26] suggested that sustained transmission and rapid (exponential) growth of cases are possible over a range of humidity and temperature conditions. Bu et al. [22] concluded that a temperature range of 13~19â„ƒ and humidity of 50% ~ 80% are suitable for the survival and transmission of COVID-19. Moreover, Wang et al. [31] have support the role that temperature could have in changing the COVID-19 human-to-human transmission and that there might be an optimal temperature for the viral transmission.
They suggested that colder regions in the world should adopt the strictest social control measures, since low temperatures significantly contribute to the viability, transmission rate and survival of coronaviruses. Finally, Kathabbi et al. [34] stated that by air quality analysis in areas highly contaminated by the virus, the population could be informed and be encouraged to avoid this area, creating a microclimate that helps to eliminate the spread of COVID-19.
AraÃºjo et al. [9] made it clear that it is not possible to characterize the exact local temperature and humidity conditions that minimizing the virus spread. On the contrary, it is reasonable to determine the type of macroclimate conditions in the places where transmission is occurring. For example, in the tropics, where high temperatures and humidity characterize the weather, the climatic suitability for spread of COVID-19 seems to be more difficult. Heat intolerance of the virus is probably related to the breakdown of their lipid bilayer, [39] in a similar model to what occurs with the predecessor of the new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV. [40] Speculative explanation also based on patterns observed for other SARS-CoV justifies the effect of humidity on the less effective spread of the virus on the environment, which reduces the total indirect and secondary transmission.

High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [42, 43] and of SARS coronavirus. [11, 38] The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air. [44] Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts' immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus. [45] Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus. [35] Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection. Some possible reasons are: low temperature provides suitable survival and reproduction conditions for coronavirus; [46] cold air causes vasoconstriction of the respiratory tract which contributes to weakening of the immune system; and dry cold air makes the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, thereby creating opportunities for virus invasion. [47] In contrast, a long period of low or extremely cold temperature played a positive role in reducing the transmission of the coronavirus. [9, 22] In addition, Bukhari et al. [23] discuss another hypothesis for the lower number of COVID-19 cases detected in the tropics. It could be due to less mass testing as many of the underdeveloped countries that presents deficiency in the health care system and may have not done enough testing to detect the actual spread of this virus.
Two of the articles were classified as retrospective and prospective [24, 25] since they suggest implementing future public policies and mass actions that aim to control the spread of COVID-19 around the world. Chen et al. [24] proposed a daily predictive model that in combination with weather observations in the previous 14 days, for five highlatitude cities (New York, Toronto, Italy, Paris and Cologne), is able to predict daily new case counts of COVID-19 for the following 12 days in these places. It is important to notice that a single weather factor alone could not affect the virus transmission too much.
However the combination of different meteorological variables could fit a more complex model, in order to address the systematic influence of different types of weather data on the spread of the virus. Jiwei et al. [25] verified further control with specific medicines and an effective vaccine. Considering the practice of social isolation, the process of this All rights reserved.

According to Oliveiros et al., [27] temperature and humidity contribute to a maximum of 18% of the variation, the remaining 82% being related to other factors such as containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation, and cultural aspects. Population migration is another key factor in the spread process that cannot be ignored, [25] as well as community structure, social dynamics, and global connectivity. [23] In cities with higher levels of population density, the virus is expected to spread faster than that in less crowded cities. [30] Al-Rousan et al. [20] suggested that international governments should adopt rigorous public policies. This can be done by increasing the number of health professionals and hospitals, and socially isolating mainly the suspected cases. Better health care facilities tend to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. [30] The relatively fast outbreak, associated with imperfect daily reporting practices, make a vast underreporting of new cases of COVID-19. Travel limitations and other control interventions need to be implemented consistently. [28] Additionally, Gupta [33] recommended that all citizens be required to wear a face mask whenever they go out, because the primarily viral infection is through airborne or close contact. The Chinese government used this as a key tool in managing the disease, especially with asymptomatic infected people.
Finally, the review process of the selected articles should be evaluated with caution. Ten of the included studies in this systematic review have not yet gone through the peer review process, which must be taken into consideration when making any inference from the authors' conclusion. [9, [20] [21] [22] 24, [26] [27] [28] 31, 35] The results of this systematic review indicate that the confounding variables, together, are even more significant than temperature and relative humidity. The timing, implementation, and magnitude of the likely public interventions from international governments should reduce the adverse consequences of COVID-19 on the public health system. Only with proper planning will unnecessary damage be avoided for individuals and the global economy.
The eligibility criteria adopted in the selection of participants were not clear in all included articles. It was only reported that the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 was obtained through secondary data available on websites.

Furthermore, some studies [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] 26, 29, 30] have not evaluated possible confounding factors that could influence the impact of climatic variables on the spread of COVID-19, such as migration patterns, containment measures, general health policies, population density, herd immunity, transportation, and cultural aspects. The articles that included these variables in their analysis [25, 27, 28, 31] concluded that climate alone does not explain most of the variability in the spread of the disease.
Considering the existing scientific evidence, the spread of COVID-19 seems to be lower in warm and wet climates. However, the certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low. Furthermore, temperature and humidity alone do not explain most of the variability of the COVID-19 outbreak. Public isolation policies, herd immunity, migration patterns, population density, and cultural aspects might directly influence how the spread of this disease occurs.
