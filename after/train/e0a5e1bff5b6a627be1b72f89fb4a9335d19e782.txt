≤ 2.5 μ m (PM 2.5 ) and ≤ 10 μ m (PM 10 ), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM 10 and PM 2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results.
Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 μ g/m 3 increase in concentration of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM 10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM 2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM 2.5 and PM 10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and
1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 μ g/m 3 increase in concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of PM 2.5 on daily confirmed cases were greater than PM 10 in all included lag days.
This nationwide study suggests that airborne PM pollution likely increases the risk of getting COVID-19 in China.
. It is confirmed that influenza is a seasonal-depended respiratory disease, causing great health problems among human every year, particularly during winter and early spring (Huang et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2020 ). COVID-19 was also first confirmed in winter with low temperature and low humidity, which along with small diurnal temperature range were assessed to be the most important environmental factors favoring its transmission ( W a n g e t a l . 2 0 2 0 )
. Dry and cold environment favors SARS-Cov-2 to survive and transmit in droplet or in the form of aerosol (Araujo and Naimi 2020) .
Previous studies show that aerosol particles emitting from coughing by influenza patients contain high level of influenza virus and these particles are within the respirable size range . These aerosols having virus are easy to transmit among individuals. It is reported that aerosols from highly virulent pathogens like severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could travel more than six feet (Kutter et al. 2018) . Also, these aerosols are likely composed of airborne pollution particles and attached virus droplets, which promote the spread of pathogen like influenza viruses (Mori et al. 2017 ). An ecologic analysis found that there were positive relationship between PM 2.5 concentration and influenza-like-illness risk in

. In addition to influenza, the SARS break in 2003 was also found related to air pollution, and the levels of PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μ m (PM 10 ) were positively associated with the SARS mortality (Kan et al. 2005) . Like SARS-CoV and influenza viruses, a recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, including both liquid and solid aerosol ).
Therefore, COVID-19 transmission is likely affected by airborne airborne PM.
Environmental factors were related to the incidence of COVID-19 and SARS, and previous study reported that the population migration was significantly associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases . Thecontrolling of population migration should be critical to study the association between COVID-19 and environmental factors (Chen et al. 2020) . Concerning about that, we collected population migration scale index (MSI) to represent the population migration level and controlled it in the fitted general linear model with binomial negative distribution to examine the associations between air airborne PM pollution and COVID-19 confirmed cases.

We conducted a two-stage analysis to estimate the effects of airborne PM on COVID-19 cases.
In the first stage, we fitted generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution to estimate the associations between airborne PM pollution and daily counts of confirmed case in each city by controlling daily average AT, AH and MSI.
The models were fitted based on R software (version 3.6.0) and the "mgcv" package (version 1.8-31). The model framework was as follows:
In this model, t refers to the day of the observation; Y t is the observed daily confirmed case counts on day t; E(Y t ) is the expected daily confirmed case counts on day t; α is the intercept; β represents the regression coefficient; airborne PM, including PM 10 and PM 2.5 , represents concentrations at day t. We controlled 3-day moving average MSI in the models and used natural smooth functions with 6 df for 3-day moving average AT and 3 df for 3-day moving average AH to control potential nonlinear and lagged confounding effects of weather conditions. Because the latent period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days (Lin and Li 2020), we chose to estimate the single day lag effects (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) and
cumulative lag effects (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The results were expressed as the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the per 10 μ g/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations.
In the second stage, we used random effects meta-analysis to combine all city-specific results. The subgroup analysis was conducted in different scenarios. First, we explored the effects in different case counts groups. Second, we divided the cities into different groups according to the thresholds of particulate matter levels (PM 10 , 50

Third, due to the stricter control measures in Hubei than other cities, we separately analyzed the effects in the cities from Hubei province and the cities outside Hubei.
The meta-analysis was performed based on STATA software (version 11, StataCorp LLC, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided and P-values with less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
In these 72 cities, 43 cities confirmed more than 100 cases and 29 cities confirmed less than 100 cases, among which the 12 Hubei cities (not include Wuhan)
confirmed the most cases (16759, 67.20%). The daily average concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 showed a similar trend, both declined significantly after January 23 (Fig.1) . Chinese cities during January 08 to March 02 2020.
As shown in Fig.2 , we used meta-analysis to pool all the city-specific effects together according to the stratification via total case counts more or less than 100
cases. There were significantly positive associations between the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and PM 10 , PM 2.5 . For PM 10 and PM 2.5 , the single-day overall effects All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In cumulative lag effects, the pooled estimates of 72 cities were all significant and the strongest effects for both PM 10 and PM 2.5 appeared in lag 014 and the RRs of each 10 μ g/m 3 increase were 1.47(95% CIs:1.34, 1.61) and 1.64 (95% CIs:1.47, 1.82), respectively. Those cities with more than 100 confirmed cases showed higher risk of COVID-19 related to PM 10 and PM 2.5 compared with cities with less than 100 cases. Additionally, the overall effect is much higher for PM 2.5 than the PM 10 . author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For PM 10 , there are 37 cities with an average PM 10 concentration greater than 50 μ g/m 3 and 35 cities with the concentrations smaller than 50 μ g/m 3 . Also, significant positive effects were found both in the PM 2.5 and PM 10 at different levels, but stronger effects were found in cities with the concentration of PM 2.5 and PM 10 under national standards. The fitted curves showed that the cities outside Hubei confirmed more COVID-19 cases around 30 μ g/m 3 for PM 2.5 and 60 μ g/m 3 for PM 10 , similar trend were also found for the cities (12 cities) in Hubei cities. Association analysis indicated that both the cities inside Hubei and outside Hubei had the highest RR of COVID-19 in lag 014 for both PM 2.5 and PM 10 .

Meanwhile, because of evidently influence of meteorological factors in COVID-19 transmission (Wang et al. 2020b; Oliveiros et al. 2020 ) we chose to control meteorological factors and MSI in our models to clarify the associations between COVID-19 case counts and airborne PM pollution. After controlling these factors, we found both PM 2.5 and PM 10 were positively related to the COVID-19 confirmed cases, suggesting the airborne PM pollution might affect the COVID-19 transmission. This was similar to other studies focusing on the influenza and SARS. A study conducted in 47 Chinese cities has found that ambient PM 2.5 may increase the risk of exposure to influenza in China especially during days with low temperature ). Croft etc. have found that short-term increases in traffic and other combustion sources-related PM 2.5 might contribute to the increased rates of influenza hospitalizations (Croft et al. 2020 . By conducting an ecologic study, Cui etc. found that case fatality rate of SARS in 5 regions increased with the increment of air pollution index (API) and those patients in regions with higher API suffered greater risks of death(Y e t a l .
.It is speculated that SARS-Cov-2 might also be transmitted by aerosols(van . Therefore, higher level of airborne particulate matters may increase the transmission of COVID-19.
PM pollution is a health hazard which could impair the immune function (Wei and Tang 2018) . Research reported that airborne PM decreased the ability of pulmonary macrophages to effectively mount a defense against infection, which would last at least a week post-exposure via RelB activation (Migliaccio et al. 2013 ).
Since pulmonary macrophages are very important in lung to phagocytize pathogene, the suppressed of that function would increase the invasive ability of SARS-Cov-2. In All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In particular, these severe inflammation in lung after exposure to PM 2.5 were found to be mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which showed significant increase in lung after PM 2.5 exposure(L a n d T S 2 0 2 0 )

Interestingly, it is reported that the receptor binding domain of the SARS-Cov-2 could be recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, which are predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type in subsegmental bronchial branches (Lukassen et al. 2020; Yan et al. 2020 In conclusion, our results indicate that airborne PM likely increase the risk of All rights reserved.
