Lower respiratory viral infections, such as influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome 33 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections, often cause severe viral pneumonia in aged individuals. 34
Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic non-resolving lung pathology 35 and exaggerated accumulation of CD8 + tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the respiratory 36 tract of aged hosts. TRM accumulation relies on elevated TGF-b present in aged tissues. Further, 37
we show that TRM isolated from aged lungs lack a subpopulation characterized by expression of 38 molecules involved in TCR signaling and effector function. Consequently, TRM cells from aged 39 lungs were insufficient to provide heterologous protective immunity. Strikingly, the depletion of 40 CD8 + TRM cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in 41 aged, but not young, animals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that age-associated TRM cell 42 malfunction supports chronic lung inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae following viral pneumonia 43 in aged hosts.
Aged individuals (65 and older) will comprise 20 percent of the population in developed 64 countries in the coming decades. It is well established that the peripheral CD8 + T cell 65 compartment that contributes to cellular immunity shrinks in number, diversity, and quality as 66 we age [1] [2] [3] . As a consequence, memory T cells are enriched and T Cell Receptor (TCR) 67
repertoires are narrowed during homeostasis [4] . Consequently, the magnitude and the quality of 68 primary effector CD8 + T cell response often is compromised in aged hosts following pathogen 69 challenge [5] . Likewise, the development of CD8 + memory T cell responses in the circulation 70 and/or in the lymphoid organs is often impaired during aging [6, 7] . This age-related CD8 + T cell 71 attrition in memory T cell differentiation and/or function has been linked to impaired host 72 responses to pathogens following primary infection or vaccination in aged hosts [8] . 73 74 Tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells (TRM) with potent effector potential are mainly located in 75 peripheral tissue at portals of pathogen entry, whereas circulating central and effector memory T 76 cells survey lymphoid organs and/or peripheral tissues [9, 10] . It has been shown that CD8 + TRM 77 cells can provide nearly sterilizing protection if present in sufficient numbers [11] . Therefore, 78 great enthusiasm has recently centered on enhancing local CD8 + TRM responses as a promising 79 vaccination strategy to control mucosal infections including influenza virus infection [12] . Much 80 progress has been made recently regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating 81 TRM cell development and maintenance [13, 14] . However, relatively less is known regarding the 82 effects of aging in the development and/or function of TRM responses in the mucosal tissues 83 following primary infection. Of note, analysis of spatial and temporal maps of T cell 84 compartmentalization revealed that aged lungs harbor increased levels of CD8 + CD69 + TRM-like 85 cells compared to young lungs [1] . However, it is unclear whether this is caused by a gradual 86 depletion of CD8 + TRM cells resulted in decreased tissue inflammation and lowered lung collagen 123 deposition. Thus, we have discovered an age-associated paradox in CD8 + TRM cell responses. 124 CD8 + TRM cell accumulation in aged hosts was not coupled to enhanced protective immunity, but 125 rather, to chronic lung pathology and fibrotic sequelae following primary viral pneumonia. 
To investigate the short and long-term effects of aging on influenza disease severity, young (2 157 month old) and aged (21-22 month old) C57BL/6 mice were infected with influenza A virus 158 (IAV; A/PR8/34 strain (PR8), Figure 1A ). While 100% of young mice survived from intranasal 159 infection with PR8, ~50% of aged mice succumbed to the infection by day 12 ( Figure 1B) , which 160 are consistent with previous reports that aged mice exhibited enhanced host mortality following 161 primary influenza infection [22] . Aged mice that survived exhibited prolonged weight recovery, 162 although their weight completely recovered by 20 days post infection (d.p.i.) ( Figure 1C ). 163
Interestingly, these differences in acute morbidity and mortality were seen despite similar viral 164 replication at 9 d.p.i. and complete viral clearance in the respiratory tract in both groups by 15 165 d.p.i. ( Figure 1D ) similar to previous reports [23] . 166 167 Recent clinical and experimental evidence suggests that severe acute influenza infection may 168 cause persistent lung pathology, remodeling, and pulmonary dysfunction [20, 24] . To determine 169 whether these acute differences in host morbidity result in differential tissue pathological 170 sequela, we examined the kinetics of histopathology in the lungs following acute PR8 infection 171 in young and aged hosts. While common features of pulmonary aging such as enlarged alveoli 172 were observed prior to infection (0 d.p.i.), leukocytic infiltrates were not prominent in either 173 aged or young naive lungs ( Figure 1E ). At peak of host inflammatory responses and weight-loss 174 (9 d.p.i.) and even several weeks later (30 d.p.i.) , lung histopathology and tissue damage 175 appeared comparable between young and aged mice ( Figure 1E & F). However, at 60 d.p.i., 176 lungs from aged mice showed a higher density of parenchymal disruption compared to lungs 177 from young mice ( Fig. 1E & F) . These data suggest that acute influenza virus infection in aged 178 mice results in persistent non-resolving pathological pulmonary responses. 179 180 To confirm these lung histopathological data, we examined the presence of inflammatory 181 monocytes and neutrophils, two major inflammatory cells that can cause pulmonary 182 inflammation and tissue damage [22, 25] . To discern the anatomical location of the cell 183 infiltrates, we examined the vascular and parenchymal fractions of the lungs through the 184 injection of intravenous CD45 antibody (Ab) 5 min before sacrifice [26] ( Figure 1G ). In this 185 setting, CD45i.v.cells were within lung tissue, while CD45i.v. + cells were in lung blood vessels. 186
Neutrophil counts in the circulation exhibited a slight increase in aging relative to young as has 187 been reported at 9 d.p.i. ( Figure 1H ) [22] . Further, there were more tissue-resident neutrophils 188 and monocytes in the aged group at 9 d.p.i. ( Figure 1H ). By 60 d.p.i., the differences of 189 neutrophil and monocytes numbers in the circulation were lost compared to 9 d.p.i., yet evidence 190 of parenchymal neutrophil and monocytes persisted in aged lungs compared to young mice 191 ( Figure 1H ). Together, the data point to an infection-induced age-related non-resolving 192 inflammatory response following primary influenza virus infection. 193 194 We next measured the expression of 560 immune-related genes in the lungs before (0 d.p.i.) or at 195 60 d.p.i. using Nanostring. The immune gene profiles of the lungs from young or aged 196 uninfected mice were quite similar except a few genes-associated with "inflammaging" [27], 197 which were modestly increased in aged lungs ( Figure 1I ). Further, the expression profile of the 198 immune-related genes in the lungs from infected young mice (60 d.p.i.) was quite similar to 199 those of lungs from uninfected mice, suggesting that lungs from infected young mice largely 200 return to immune homeostasis at 60 d.p.i. However, the expression of most immune response-201 related genes were upregulated in infected aged lungs relative to those of uninfected young or 202 aged lungs, or infected young lungs ( Figure 1I ). The mRNA signal ratios of infected versus non-203 infected lungs in the young or aged groups identified 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 204 shared between young and aged groups; 12 were unique to young and 349 were unique to aged 205 samples ( Figure 1I , top right panel). When comparing gene expression ratios of aged to young 206 lungs, before and after infection, there were only 16 unique age-related DEGs prior to infection, 207
whereas 32 were shared prior to and after infection between young and aged groups. In contrast, 208 348 unique DEGs were observed at day 60 post-infection in aged groups compared to infected 209 young lungs ( Figure 1I , bottom right panel). Among those DEGs, influenza infection led to 210 greatly increased expression of myeloid cell-associated genes, cytokine and chemokine genes, 211 and genes involved in lymphocyte responses in aged lungs (Figure S1A-C). Together, these data 212 indicated that the immune landscape of aged and young lungs is grossly similar prior to 213 infection, but aged lungs exhibit greatly exacerbated inflammatory gene expression and failed to 214 return to immune homeostasis months after primary infection. 215 could be due to increased infiltration of effector T cells in aged mice. We therefore examined 247 effector T cell responses in the lungs and spleens at 10 d.p.i. We found that while D b -PA 248 responses appear to be equivalent in the lungs between young and aged mice, there was a deficit 249 in the generation of D b -NP specific CD8 + T cells in the lungs ( Figure 2K ). Furthermore, there 250 were significantly lower levels of both D b -NP and D b -PA effector T cells in the spleens and 251 circulation ( Figure 2K ) of aged mice compared to controls as previously reported [33] . 252 Therefore, aged mice exhibit enhanced CD8 + TRM numbers despite having lower levels of 253 effector T cell responses. 254 255 Influenza-specific lung memory CD8 + T cells of aged hosts are tissue resident 256
To verify whether the CD8 + CD69 + T cells in the lung that were protected from intravenous 257 labeling where bona fide tissue-resident cells, we infected aged mice with influenza and 258 performed parabiosis surgery to join the circulation of infected aged mice (CD45.2 + ) with a 259 young naive congenic (CD45.1 + ) animal at 5 weeks post infection ( Figure 3A ). Four weeks after 260 parabiosis, we observed equilibration of CD8 + T cells from each parabiont in the blood and 261 spleens ( Figure 3B & C and S3A), confirming the successful exchange of circulating immune 262 cells between parabionts. A vast majority of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages belonged to 263 the host in both animals as would be expected from this population that is maintained mainly 264 through self-renewal [34] ( Figure S3B ). Together, these two observations indicate that shared 265 circulation was achieved and the model is able to distinguish the origin of circulating and 266 residential immune cells in a manner consistent with previously described findings. 267
The parenchymal compartment of the aged infected hosts had a significantly larger number of 269 CD8 + CD69 + T cells than the uninfected parabiont, of which ~95% were from the aged 270 parabiont, despite indistinguishable numbers of CD8 + T cells in both the lung vasculature and 271 spleens between the young and aged parabionts ( Figure 3D & E). Roughly 99% of total 272 parenchymal CD8 + CD69 + D b -NP + cells in the lungs of two parabionts were found in aged lungs 273 (Figure 3 F, G). In contrast, there were comparable CD45-i.v. + CD8 + D b -NP + cells that were 274 found in the lung circulation between young and aged parabionts ( Figure 3G ). Likewise, we 275 observed similar patterns on the distribution of the D b -PA-specific CD8 + T cells in lung 276 parenchyma and circulation (Figure 3H & I & S3E) . Notably, there were no major differences in 277 CD8 + splenic memory T cells between the two parabionts for the same antigen specificities 278 ( Figure S3D & F). Together, these data suggest that aged lung parenchymal CD8 + influenza-279 specific memory T cells are mainly tissue-resident. 280 281
It remains unclear if the excessive accumulation of TRM cells in aged lungs is due to the aged 283 environment or intrinsic T cell differences in the development and/or repertoire between young 284 and aged mice. To examine these possibilities, we adoptively transferred CD8 + Ovalbumin 285 (OVA)-TCR transgenic OT-I T cells of young naive donors to young or aged hosts. We then 286 infected the mice with recombinant influenza virus expressing cognate OVA peptide 287 (SIINFEKL) (PR8-OVA) [35] and evaluated memory T cell responses at 7 weeks after infection 288 ( Figure 4A ). There were increased numbers of OT-I TRM present in aged lung tissue versus 289 young ( Figure 4B ), while equivalent numbers of lung circulating or splenic memory OT-I cells 290
were observed between young and aged mice ( Figure 4C & D) . Together, these data indicated 291 that the aged microenvironment facilitates lung TRM cell accumulation following influenza virus 292 infection even though the responding cells were from the same young donor. 293
To explore the potential mechanisms regulating CD8 + TRM cell accumulation during aging, we 295 performed qRT-PCR analysis on infected lungs to examine the expression of Il15, Tnf and Tgfb1, 296 which are important in TRM cell development and/or maintenance [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . We found that Tgfb1 297 transcript levels were elevated in infected aged lungs compared to those of infected young lungs 298 ( Figure 4E ). Previously, TGF-bR signaling was shown to be critical for the development of both 299 CD69 + CD103 + and CD69 + CD103lung TRM cells [41] . Therefore, we examined whether the 300 excessive accumulation of CD8 + TRM cells in aged lungs is dependent on TGF-bR signaling. To 301 this end, we adoptively transferred young WT or TGFbRII-deficient (TGFbRII KO, dlLck-Cre 302 Tgfbr2 fl/fl ). OT-I cells into young or aged hosts, and then infected the mice with PR8-OVA. 303
TGFbRII deficiency not only diminished OT-I TRM development in young mice, but also 304 abolished the excessive accumulation of OT-I TRM in aged mice ( Figure 4F ). However, TGFbRII 305 deficiency did not significantly affect splenic memory T cell responses in young or aged mice 306 ( Figure 4G ). Thus, these data suggest that excessive accumulation of CD8 + TRM cells in aged 307 lungs is dependent on d TGF-bR signals in aged tissue environment. 308 309 Age-associated dysfunction of TRM cells against a major protective epitope 310 TRM cells are vital for heterologous influenza virus reinfection [43] . Since aged lungs 311 accumulated significant more CD8 + TRM cells, it is plausible that aged mice may exhibit 312 enhanced protective heterologous immunity against viral reinfection. To this end, we employed a 313 heterologous infection and challenge model in which we infected young or aged mice with PR8 314 virus and then re-challenge the mice with a lethal dose of X31 virus in the presence of FTY720, 315 which blocks the contribution of protective circulating memory T cells [12] . PR8 and X31 316 viruses differ in viral surface proteins, but share internal viral proteins such as NP, which are 317 cross-recognized by memory CD8 + T cells [44, 45] . We confirmed that FTY720 treatment 318 abolished T cell migration ( Figure S4A ). We then followed host morbidity and mortality daily 319 following X31 challenge. All naïve young or aged mice succumbed to lethal X31 infection 320 ( Figure S4B ), while PR8-infected young mice were fully protected from lethal X31 infection in 321 the presence of FTY720 ( Figure 5A ). Strikingly, ~75% of PR8-infected aged animals succumbed 322 to secondary X31 re-challenge, which was almost comparable to mortality of primary X31 323 infection in those mice ( Figure 5A and S4B). Thus, the enhanced presence of CD8 + TRM cells in 324 aged lungs failed to provide heterologous protection against influenza reinfection. 325 326 Among influenza-specific CD8 + T cells, D b -NP-specific T cells appear to be particularly critical 327 for the protection against secondary heterologous viruses [46] . To examine the mechanisms 328 underlying the impaired protective function of TRM cells in aged lungs, we sorted polyclonal D b -329 NP-specific TRM from infected young or aged lungs, and performed scRNAseq at 60 d.p.i. 330 ( Figure S4C ). Compared to D b -NP TRM cells from aged mice, D b -NP TRM from the young mice 331 were enriched in genesets associated with NF-kB signaling and inflammatory immune responses 332 ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, D b -NP TRM from aged mice had decreased expression of effector 333 molecules such as Ifng and Tnf, and molecules involved with TCR signaling such as Lck and 334
Junb ( Figure 5C ). Additionally, Bhlhe40, a key transcription factor necessary for the expression 335 of effector molecules in TRM cells [13] , was diminished in TRM from aged lungs ( Figure 5C ). We 336 performed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and found that D b -NP TRM 337 from young and aged mice can be divided into 4 clusters ( Figure 5D and S4D). Cluster 0 cells 338 were mainly comprised of TRM cells from young mice, and clusters 2 and 3 cells consisted 339 mainly of TRM cells from aged mice, while cluster 1 cells were equally divided by TRM cells from 340 young and aged mice ( Figure 5D & E). Compared to the rest of cluster cells, cells in cluster 0 341 express high levels of genes associated with classical TRM signature (such as Bhleh40, Cd69 and 342 Jun), molecules associated with better TCR signaling (such as Lck, Cd3e and Cd28) and genes 343 associated with CD8 + T cell effector function (such as Ccl4 and Tnf) ( Figure 5F ). Thus, age-344 associated lung TRM cells lose a functional subpopulation that is characterized with robust 345 expression of CD8 + T cell effector and functional molecules, which likely explain the lack of 346 protection against secondary viral re-challenge. 347
To further test the capacity of TRM to elicit a protective response, we stimulated lung cells from 349 young or aged mice with NP 366-374 peptide and then measured IFN-g and TNF production by 350 CD8 + TRM cells through intracellular staining. Consistent with the scRNAseq data, D b -NP-351 specific TRM cells from aged mice exhibited diminished production of IFN-g compared to young 352 mice, particularly on the IFN-g levels were evaluated on a per cell basis ( Figure 5 G-I). 353
Moreover, CD8 + TRM cells from aged lungs were defective in simultaneously producing both 354 IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation ( Figure 5J ). Of note, splenic CD8 + memory T 355 cells were also impaired in producing both IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation 356 during aging ( Figure S5A ), suggesting that the impaired production of functional effector 357 molecules following peptide re-stimulation was not restricted to TRM cells. In contrast to their 358 diminished cytokine production following peptide stimulation (TCR signaling), total CD8 + or 359 D b -NP-specific TRM cells were capable of producing IFN-g and TNF following PMA/Ionomycin 360 restimulation ( Figure S5B , C). These data suggest that D b -NP TRM cells exhibit impaired 361 production of effector molecules specifically following TCR stimulation. Interestingly, following 362 ex vivo stimulation of D b -PA specific TRM cells by PA 224-233 peptide, we found that D b -PA 363 TRM cells from aged and young hosts had similar ability to produce IFN-g and TNF ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.040196 doi: bioRxiv preprint T cells drive chronic lung pathology at the memory phase. Consistent with the histology data, 388 high dose, but not low dose, of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of Ly6C + 389 monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in aged, but not young lung tissues ( Figure 6F ). Thus, 390 resident CD8 + T cells are responsible for the constant recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils 391 to the tissue at the memory phase. To further explore the roles of resident CD8 T cells in 392 promoting tissue inflammation at the memory stage, we measured immune-associated genes in 393 the lungs by Nanostring. There was a marked decrease in the expression of multiple cytokines 394 and particular chemokines in the lungs of mice that received high CD8 Ab treatment, compared 395 to those of lungs of mice received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab at 60 d.p.i. ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.040196 doi: bioRxiv preprint affect lung fibrosis at the memory stage. CD8 + T cell depletion did not affect lung collagen 402 content in infected young mice revealed by both Mason's trichrome staining and hydroxyproline 403 assay ( Figure 6H and I), which measures total collagen protein [49] . These data suggest that 404 normal CD8 + TRM cell responses in young mice contribute minimally to lung fibrotic responses 405 following acute influenza virus infection, which is in contrast to the excessive CD8 + TRM cell-406 induced fibrotic sequelae following PD-L1 blockade [41] . In contrast to young mice, aged mice 407 exhibited increased lung collagen deposition, particularly in the lung parenchyma ( Figure 6H & 408 J). Strikingly, mice received high CD8 Ab treatment had markedly reduced lung fibrosis as 409 revealed by Trichome staining and hydroxyproline assay, compared to lungs of mice that 410 received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab ( Figure 6J & K). These data suggest that resident but 411 not circulating CD8 + T cells are important in promoting chronic lung collagen deposition 412 following the resolution of primary influenza infection. In summary, our data indicate that 413 excessive accumulation of lung resident CD8 + T cells does not lead to enhanced protective 414 immunity in aged mice, but rather drive age-associated persistent lung inflammation and chronic 415 fibrosis following viral pneumonia.

In this report, we demonstrate that acute influenza infection leads to persistent chronic 434 pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are largely propagated by an exaggerated CD8 + TRM 435 response in aged hosts. Somewhat counterintuitively, elevated CD8 + TRM cells in the aged lung, 436 fail to provide the protective heterologous immunity to that observed in young mice, likely due 437 to a selective dysfunction in a protective CD8 + TRM cell population ( Notably, despite a numeric increase in TRM cells, protective heterologous immunity is impaired 450 in aged hosts due to a qualitative defect in TRM cells not present in young mice. The protective 451 function of TRM cells is usually associated with their effector activities at the site of pathogen re-452 entry [56] . For instance, it has been shown that IFN-g is important for TRM cell protective 453 immunity against secondary heterologous influenza virus infection [43] . Consistent with the 454 notion, scRNAseq analysis found that TRM cells against a major protective CD8 + T cell epitope 455 (D b -NP) from aged mice lose a functional TRM subset observed in young hosts; this subset was 456 characterized with robust expression of molecules associated with TCR signaling and effector 457 molecules. As a result, D b -NP specific TRM cells are less sensitive to TCR stimulation for the 458 simultaneous production of IFN-g and TNF. Thus, defective TCR-mediated effector cytokine 459 production could underlie the impaired protection against secondary influenza virus infection.

However, aging is associated with the impaired capability of tissue repair [27] . It is possible that 496 epithelial injury caused by persistent low level release of cytopathic molecules by TRM cells 497 surpasses the limited recovery capability of the aged tissue. To this end, even though D b -NP TRM 498 cells have diminished TCR signaling for IFN-g and TNF production, their responses to PMA and 499
Ionomycin are intact. Therefore, they may remain capable of producing low levels of effector 500 molecules in response to environmental inflammatory factors that are constitutively observed in 501 aged tissues [22, 27] The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.040196 doi: bioRxiv preprint
In summary, we have unveiled an age-associated paradox in CD8 + TRM cell responses. The 527 excessive accumulation of TRM cells is not protective but rather drives inflammatory and fibrotic 528 sequalae following primary respiratory viral infection. Moving forward, it is crucial to better 529 understand the mechanisms of age-associated TRM malfunction so that we can selectively restore 530 TRM protective function while minimizing their pathogenic potential in the elderly.

Mice, infections, and adoptive transfers. 558 C57BL/6 were originally purchased from Jackson (Harbor, ME) Laboratory and mostly bred in 559 house. Aged mice were received at 20-21 months of age from the National Institutes of Aging 560 and maintained in same specific-pathogen-free conditions for at least one month prior to 561 infection. In most of cases, aged and young subject bedding was cross-contaminated weekly to To examine tissue residency of lung CD69 + parenchymal CD8 + T cells, parabiotic surgery was 582 performed. CD45.1 + young naive mice were paired with infected aged CD45.2 + congenic mice at 583 35 d.p.i. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. After disinfection, 584 incisions were made in the shaved skin area then the olecranon of the knee joints of each mouse 585 was joined. Opposing incisions were closed with a continuous suture on the dorsal and ventral 586 sides. Parabionts were then allowed to rest for 4 weeks before sacrifice and examining the lung 587 .
