Systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing in order to minimize the likelyhood of resurgence in contagion. Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2. Nevertheless, this procedure may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. We evaluated the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR targeting SARS CoV-2 E and RdRp genes in a single reaction. A total of 20 minipools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) nasopharyngeal exudates collected in universal transport medium were made, each of which including a unique positive NP specimen. Positive specimens yielding C T <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for the RdRP gene (7 out of 10) were detected in mini-pools of both sizes. In contrast, most NP samples displaying C Ts > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively.

To this end, systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing thereby minimizing the likelyhood of resurgence in contagion. 1 This approach faces a variety of obstacles, most notably the limited availability of reagents resources. Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used for screening of blood donors for Human immunodeficiency virus-1 and Hepatitis C virus in low-prevalence setttings. 2 This strategy has also been applied to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2 in the United States early in the pandemic, when virus circulation was low. 3 Nevertheless, sample pooling may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. Here, the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 was evaluated using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR (REALQUALITY RQ-2019-nCoV from AB ANALITICA; Padua, Italy, performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument), and low-size mini-pools. This RT-PCR assay targets the E (envelope) and
RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) genes of SARS Cov-2 in a single reaction, with LODs of 125 and 150 copies/ml, respectively (according to the manufacturer). The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínico Universitario
Nasopharyngeal specimens (NP) collected with flocked swabs in 3 ml of universal transport medium (Beckton Dickinson, Sparks, MD,USA), which had been stored at -80ºC, were retrieved for analysis. A total of 30 leftover specimens testing negative for SARS CoV-2 were mixed and used for pooling. In turn, 10 RT-PCR positive NP specimens yielding cycle threshold values (C T ) ranging from 23.4 to 38.8 for the E gene, and 21.8 to 35.8 for the RdRP gene were selected for the experiments.

These latter specimens had been collected from adult patients (median age, 61.5 years; range, 30-85) presenting with mild disease and not requiring hospitalization, at a median of 5 days (range, 1-7 days) following appearance of symptoms. Pertinent to this study is the fact that SARS CoV-2 load in upper respiratory tract specimens from symptomatic patients peaks within the first week after infection. 4, 5 As shown in Table 1 , positive NP specimens were detected in mini-pools of both sizes, as long undiluted samples yielded RT-PCR C Ts <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for the RdRp gene (7 out of 10). As expected C Ts were reached later in pooled samples. In contrast, most NP samples displaying RT-PCR C Ts > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively).
Comprehensive testing policies in the community are primarily aimed at identifying SARS CoV-2-infected asymptomathic or paucisymptomatic individuals, who are known to represent a major source of transmission. 1 Pooling strategies of RT-PCR testing may be advantageous when compared to assaying individuals samples separately if the proportion of positive specimens in the set of samples is low enough (~1%) 6 . Previously reported data suggested that a single positive specimen could be detected in pools of up to 32 samples 5 , with a false negative rate of around 10%. In this work, pure RNA instead of original specimens were pooled for RT-PCR reactions. 6 Likewise, identification of cases was achieved in pools of 48 samples including 1-5 RT-PCR positive samples. Our experience was less satisfactory, yet, positive specimens that went undetected when tested in pools presumably had very low viral loads, as inferred by RT-PCR CT values, most likely <6 log 10 RNA copies/swab, which was shown to .
