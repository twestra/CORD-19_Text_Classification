ABSTRACT 23 In social species where offspring are reared together in communal burrows or similar 24 structures, young animals typically do not engage in between-group contact during their 25 developmenta behavioural trait we call 'offspring with restricted between-group contact' 26 (ORC). The impact of this trait on the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate 27 lifelong immunity in their hosts is currently unclear. We hypothesize that in populations with 28 ORC, the formation, in groups, of a 'protective barrier' of only recovered adults, prevents the 29 transmission of this type of pathogens to the new susceptible hosts (i.e. young animals), 30 thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out. We implement a spatially implicit 31 individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of host and 32 pathogen traits and show that the epidemic fade-out probability is consistently higher in 33 populations with ORC, especially when disease spread is fast (high basic reproduction 34 number R0). We also show that ORC can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of 35 disease risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits. We discuss our findings in INTRODUCTION 42 Pathogens of infectious diseases that spread through direct contact or physical proximity can 43 imperil species that live in dense populations or large social groups, including humans, 44 livestock or wildlife (Altizer et al. 2003 . 53 A social network can further be characterized by its modularity, that is, its degree of division 54 into modules such as social groups (e.g. clans, prides or troops) or subgroups (e.g. age classes 55 in the case of eusocial insects, Stroeymeyt et al. 2018 , also see Griffin and Nunn 2012, Sah et 56 al. 2017). Generally, a social network is considered to be highly modular, or to have a high 57 'community structure' (White et al. 2017 ) when individuals within one module are more 58 connected to each other than they are to individuals in other modules (Newman 2006 ). It has 59 been hypothesized that a highly modular social network can generally reduce disease risk in 60 group-living animals (Griffin and Nunn 2012, Nunn et al. 2015 ). Yet this view has been 61 recently challenged by a study which found that the beneficial effects of modularity on 62 disease fade-out are restricted to extreme cases of exceptionally high modularity, which are 63 rarely observed in natural systems (Sah et al. 2017) . 64 Here we investigate how highly modular social networks characterized by age-dependent networks where young animals have no contact with members of other groups, and term this 67 life history trait 'offspring with restricted between-group contact' (ORC). 68 In contrast to most ungulate species for instance, in which precocial young follow their 69 mother shortly after birth (Lent 1974) , several group-living species rear their offspring in 70 communal burrows, nurseries, crèches or family groups within group territories or home 71 ranges for extended periods of time, during which time young rarely if ever contact 72 individuals of other groups. This includes for instance spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta 73 (Kruuk 1972), African lions Panthera leo (Schaller 1972) or European rabbits Oryctolagus 74 cuniculus (Daly 1981). 75 Restricting contact of young animals with individuals of other groups may specifically limit 76 the persistence of pathogens that induce lifelong immunity following infection. Such Here we used an individual-based model to investigate for the first time this second 96 mechanism and test the prediction that the probability of epidemic fade-out increases in 97 populations (i.e. networks) of social species with an ORC trait. For this purpose, we 98 developed an SIR model to describe pathogen transmission and host population dynamics. In 99 order to assess how consistently the probability of epidemic fade-out increased due to ORC, 100 we systematically varied parameters likely to influence pathogen transmission dynamics: (1) 101 host birth rate, (2) host death rate (which occurs independently of infection), (3) contact rates 102 between members of different groups, (4) infection rate at contact, (5) individual infection 103 length, (6) virulence (i.e. the increase in host death rate due to infection), and (7) whether 104 transmission is frequency or density-dependent. For each specific combination of parameters, 105 we investigated two scenarios. First, we set up a baseline scenario in which rates of between-106 group contact were identical for individuals of all ages. Second, we investigated an ORC 107 scenario in which individuals below a given age-threshold could not contact members of 108 other groups, i.e. their rates of between-group contact were set to zero. This is simulating the 109 legal requirements of confinement put into action by authorities to limit the spread of 110 pandemics, e.g. during the COVID-19 pandemic; the closure of schools and prevention of 111 contact between young and elderly people, including within households (e.g. Anderson et al. 112 2020, Kelvin and Halperin 2020). Because ORC decreases R0, we adjusted the infection rate 113 in the baseline scenario such that the value of R0 was always identical in both scenarios to 114 insure that the emergence of a more efficient immunity barrier are directly related to the ORC 115 trait, and not to its mediated effect on R0. We discuss our results in relation to behavioural mechanisms yielding herd immunity as well as the likely outcomes of altering social network 117 modularity through management measures.
Model description 120 The model description followed the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol for 121 describing individual-and agent-based models (Grimm et al. 2006 , Grimm et al. 2010 ). The The purpose of our model was to study how disease dynamics in group-living species are 130 affected by an 'offspring with restricted between-group contact' (ORC) trait, which occurs 131 when offspring are kept in subunits or 'modules' such as communal dens and burrows, 132 crèches or family groups within their social groups, until they reach the age at which they can 133 start engaging in between-group interactions. We were particularly interested in whether, and 134 to what extent, such age-dependent patterns of between-group interactions consistently The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.036806 doi: bioRxiv preprint then start roaming more widely within the clan territory, and to accompany their mothers on 142 regular long-distance foraging trips outside the clan territory to areas containing large 143 aggregations of migratory herds East 1993, Hofer et al. 2016 social groups, which consisted of a certain number of individuals, which could change over 159 time due to processes such as mortality and dispersal. 160 Processing and scheduling 161 The model included two main processes: host population dynamics and disease dynamics.

Individuals who survived over the maximum infection length (IL) gained 190 immunity for the rest of their lives. 191 The third process (reproduction) was regulated by the carrying capacity of the host K. Births 192 occurred only in groups that were below a local breeding capacity, which was defined by the 193 maximum group size. The probability that an individual at a reproductive age of 2 years and 194 more (Age-repro ≥ 104 weeks) gave birth to one offspring was given by fage. and 195 corresponded to approximately 1 -3 offspring per year. 196 The fourth process (dispersal) described individuals which left their natal group as they 197 became reproductively mature. 198 In the last process (ageing), we updated the individual's state variable age as well as the time-199 span-infected counter. The initialization of the age of individuals was determined by a random exponential 202 distribution with a mean set at the age at first reproduction (Age-repro = 104 weeks, Table   203 1). All groups were set with a certain size and all individuals were set as susceptible, except 204 one who was set as infected. Pathogen invasion started stochastically with this one infected 205 individual chosen randomly in the initial population. The total population was at a carrying 206 capacity of 1000 individuals at the beginning of the simulations to make simulation runs 207 comparable, but the number of groups was given depending on the initialized number of 208 individuals per group (see also Table 1 ).

(3) Reproduction 257 We assumed density-dependent reproduction. Reproduction only occurred if the group size 258 was below the carrying capacity of groups, i.e. the Group.size threshold (Table 1) . If 259 reproduction occurred, then every week, each adult which was older than Age-repro gave birth 260 to a single offspring with a probability fage. All individuals were born as susceptible, 261 independently of the infection status of their parent; hence, we did not consider vertical 262 transmission or immunity due to the transmission of (maternal) antibodies to offspring 263 (through e.g. milk) for a short period after birth.

When looking at a single epidemic event in a 330 host population with ORC, we found that a new pool of susceptible juveniles (free from the 331 disease) emerged in the population a few weeks after initialization to form a peak, followed 332 by an increase in the number of susceptible adults ( figure 4 (a) ). The epidemic faded out from 333 the host population approximately 50 weeks after the initialization, both in terms of the 334 number of infected juveniles and infected adults ( figure 4(b) ). This corresponds 335 approximately to the age at which juveniles in the first cohort became adults and thus started 336 contacting (potentially infected) members of other groups (as Age-contact = 52 weeks, see 337 Table 1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.036806 doi: bioRxiv preprint
In the host population with ORC, during the first 200 weeks after pathogen invasion, the 354 proportion of groups that did not contribute to the between-group transmission increased over 355 time ( figure 5 (a), (b) ). These groups were 'sealed' because they were composed of adults 356 who were all recovered and juveniles (susceptible, infected or recovered) who did not contact The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.036806 doi: bioRxiv preprint
The complete predominance of such sealed groups in the host population with ORC after 379 several weeks was associated with epidemic fade-out ( figure 5 (b), figure 4 (b) ). We found 380 that ORC had a particularly positive effect for the host population in terms of epidemic fade-381 out when R0 was elevated (e.g. equivalent to measles infection in humans, where R0 ~ 18), 382 and to hosts with high fertility rates and small group sizes ( figure 3 ). This may be because the 383 high production of offspring in small groups may further accelerate the formation of sealed 384 groups and hence pathogen fade-out. 385 We investigated a specific form of network modularity, also called 'community structure' The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.036806 doi: bioRxiv preprint social network metrics during the epidemic ─ as modularity or centrality can only represent a 404 snapshot of the community structure at one point in time. 405 In a disease management context, individuals with high contact rates to their group members 406 are often targeted for vaccination to control the spread of infectious diseases (Carne et al. Table 2 for other examples). Our 427 results might also be applicable to cases where offspring are not stationary yet potentially 428 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
