1 Background: Despite a paucity of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and 2 azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected 3 COVID-19. Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT 4 interval prolongation. 5 Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted 6
between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine 7 or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett's) 8 using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc ≥500 ms 9 (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc ≥550 (if QRS ≥120 ms) and b) increased QTc of ≥60 ms. Tisdale 10 score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated.
Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both 12 drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62±17 yrs, 13 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 14 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36ms (p=0.005) with 15 medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms vs -0.2±28 ms 16 in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable 17 logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not 18 associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the 19 combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the 20 combination vs. azithromycin alone (17±39 vs. 0.5±40 ms, p=0.07). No patients 21 manifested torsades de pointes.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health challenge at a 2 global level. 1 As of April 9, 2020, ≥395,000 Americans have tested positive and over 3 ≥12,700 of those patients 2 have succumbed to this illness. In the absence of a vaccine 4 or any proven therapeutic agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ), 5 often used in combination, have emerged as a potential therapy based on extremely HCQ is an anti-malarial drug which has also been used to treat arthritis and systemic 10 lupus erythematosus. AZ is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of 11 bacterial infections. Both drugs prolong the QT interval by blocking the KCNH2-encoded 12 hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of torsades des 13 pointes. [5] [6] [7] In general, HCQ is reasonably well-tolerated and used chronically in arthritis 14 and SLE patients without heart rhythm monitoring. 8 In 2013, the FDA issued a black 15 warning for AZ following multiple reported cases of QTc prolongation followed by 16 torsades des pointes. 9 Since the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients is so recent 17 and based largely on in vitro studies 10 and anecdotal observations 11 , community 18 prescribing practices are as-yet unclear. More importantly, there is no information 19 available regarding the extent of QTc prolongation with a combination of HCQ and AZ. 20 From first principles, simultaneous block of the hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium 21 channel with both agents may cause critical QTc prolongation and an elevated risk of 22 torsades des pointes. We therefore evaluated prescribing practices and monitored the 23 .

This study was approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board. We identified 5 all patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection as well as patients under investigation 6 (PUI) admitted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California between 7 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who received either AZ and/or HCQ as part of their medical 8 treatment. A detailed, retrospective chart review was then performed via the electronic 9 health record (Epic, Verona, WI) at our institution. Of the PUI and confirmed COVID-19 10 cases, we only included patients who had at least two 12-lead electrocardiograms 11 (ECGs) performed in our MUSE system between 1/1/2020 and 4/5/2020. Patients with 12 paced ventricular rhythms, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, or 13 ECGs otherwise unsuitable for accurate QT interval measurement were excluded. 14 Additionally, patients without ECGs performed on day 2 of medication administration or CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 25, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 /2020 We compared obtained standard 12-lead ECG parameters, including the corrected QT 1 interval (QTc, Bazett's formula) from the baseline ECG closest to and prior to 2 medication administration, to the longest QTc observed post-medication administration 3 up to 24 hours after the last medication dose. Given variability in heart rates, QTc 4 prolongation was also evaluated using the Fridericia formula for correction of the QT 5 interval. QT measurements were independently reviewed and validated by a 6 cardiologist to ensure accuracy of the automatic measurement and manually re-7 measured if needed. Patients were assigned into to one of 3 three groups depending on 8 which medication they received -AZ, HCQ, or AZ + HCQ. Patient demographics, 9 clinical history, labs, and medications were obtained from detailed chart review, 10 including risk factors to calculate the Tisdale score 12 and the Elixhauser comorbidity 11 index 13 for each patient. The Tisdale score consists of age ≥ 68 yrs, female sex, use of 12 loop diuretics, potassium level ≤ 3.5 mEq/L, baseline QTc ≥ 450 ms, acute MI, number 13 of QT prolonging medications, sepsis, and heart failure and has been developed as a 14 risk score for QTc interval prolongation. The Elixhauser comorbidity index incorporates 15 21 different variables, including obesity, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, chronic 16 kidney disease, HIV, and cancer and is used to predict in-hospital mortality.
Outcomes of interest were baseline QTc ≥470 ms 14 , and post-medication critical QTc 19 prolongation defined as follows: a) maximum post-medication QTc ≥500 ms (if QRS 20 <120 ms) or QTc ≥550 (if QRS ≥120 ms) and b) mean increase from baseline QTc to 21 maximum post-medication QTc of ≥60 ms. 14, 15

We also evaluated the 3 frequency of critical ECG changes overall, by medication type, and by patient 4 characteristics using chi-square analyses. Given the relatively low number of patients 5 who received HCQ alone, the decision was made to only compare AZ to the 6 combination of AZ + HCQ. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate 7 whether age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were associated 8 with critical QTc prolongation.
A total of 490 patients were admitted to our medical center with a verified or suspected 11 diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study time period, and 314 (64%) were treated with 12 AZ, HCQ, or the combination. Of these, 192 patients had a 12-lead ECG performed 13 during treatment, and a subgroup of 98 confirmed COVID infection or PUI (age 62±17 14 yrs, 61% male) met criteria for inclusion in the study (Table 1) CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The mean change in QTc values was greatest in the combined HCQ and AZ group, and 5 when compared to the AZ group, QTc prolongation due to the combination was 6 observed to be several-fold higher than due to AZ alone (17.2±39.0 ms vs 0.5±40.3 ms, (Table 3 ).There were no significant differences in regards to age, sex, sepsis, Table 4 ). 75% of patients with critical QTc prolongation had a 15 high Tisdale score whereas 60.5% of patients without critical QTc changes had a high 16 Tisdale score (p=0.33). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the Elixhauser 17 comorbidity indices of the two groups (p=0.86). In a multivariable logistic regression, 18 none of the following predictors were significantly associated with critical QTc 19 prolongation: age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc (p>0.14). No 20 patients had syncope, torsades de pointes, or other lethal arrhythmias during or after 21 drug administration.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 25, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 At a single large community medical center, we studied 98 COVID-19 positive or 1 suspected patients with HCQ and AZ, administered either individually or in combination.
Although lethal arrhythmias were not observed during the limited period of observation, 3 12% of patients attained critical QTc prolongation, and that QTc prolongation was 4 many-fold higher when HCQ and AZ were administered in combination compared with 5 AZ alone. Moreover, patients who achieved critical QTc prolongation were not 6 distinguished by significantly higher Tisdale scores, nor by higher Elixhauser 7 comorbidity indices.
Our finding of greatest QTc prolongation in the combined HCQ + AZ group is important.
In our study, patients with lower values of QTc at baseline were more likely to be started 10 on the combination of the two medications. In contrast, patients with a higher baseline 11 QTc were more likely to receive either HCQ or AZ rather than the combination. This 12 suggests that prescription practice may have been driven by a concern regarding 13 excessive QTc prolongation with the use of both medications in combination. Further 14 review of our data showed that some practitioners decided on a staggered dosing 15 regimen of one drug followed by the other drug later in the hospital stay. However, given 16 the prolonged half-lives of these medications, such practice still results in a combined 17 drug effect on the QTc.
Another interesting finding in our study was that men had significantly higher rates of 19 QTc prolongation than women. The incidence of torsade de pointes is known to be 20 higher in women, and female sex is a risk factor in the Tisdale score for QT 21 prolongation. The reasons for this discrepancy still need to be explained, but could be 22 related to the majority of patients in our population being men. Since rates of high 23 .

Overall, our findings support the need to monitor the QTc during the period that these 4 two medications are administered, especially when used in combination. We were not 5 able to distinguish patients more likely to have critical QTc prolongation by the Tisdale 6 score or Elixhauser index, making monitoring during medication administration likely to 7 be a safer approach. 14 In addition to QTc prolongation as a result of KCNH2-encoded The variation in dosing patterns and duration of treatment for each medication are 18 important to note as this can potentially influence when the ECG with the longest QTc 19 may be observed. Due to inconsistency in obtaining daily ECGs during medication 20 administration, we believe that the 12% of patients who experienced critical QTc 21 prolongation was likely an under-estimation. Furthermore, variability in heart rates,

We reported the 1 QTc using Bazett's correction, which is consistent with the majority of the published 2 literature as well as ECG recording machines in typical use. The relatively small sample 3 size does not allow for assessment of torsades des pointes risk with these agents.
