Background: Some have claimed that the number of COVID-19 deaths is not much greater than would be experienced in the usual course of events. We sought to estimate
COVID-19 deaths are increasing rapidly. At 5 PM GMT on April 7, 2020 the worldwide COVID-19 death toll was reported to be 79,055 with 11,907 of these deaths occurring in the United States (US). 1 One aspect of this grim situation that has received less attention is the extent to which some of these deaths would have occurred without the viral insult. Noted British statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter was quoted as saying "Many people who die of Covid would have died anyway within a short period." 2 Triggle asserted that "Knowing exactly how many [would have died anyway within a short period] is impossible to tell at this stage." 2 To estimate excess COVID-19 deaths compared to deaths projected for the same period of time in the absence of COVID-19, Bannerjee, et al, used life table methods to estimate excess one-year mortality from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK). 3 They found that if 10% of the UK population were infected, the number of excess deaths would be 13,791 if COVID-19 confers a 20% increase in mortality risk and 34,479 deaths with a 50% increase in risk.
On April 5, 2020 Murray and colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicted that 67,212 COVID-19 deaths will occur in the US during April 2020 with a total of 81,766 (95% UI: 49,431 -136,401) deaths by June 22, 2020, the estimated date of the last death in the US at the end of the first wave of the pandemic. 4, 5 The projections assume continuation of full social distancing through the end of May 2020. The IHME death total has received national recognition recently. 6 The goals of our study were to estimate the number of excess deaths during April 2020 based on published infection fatality rates (IFRs). Excess deaths are those that would not have occurred when they did or as soon as they did in the absence of SARS-CoV-2.
We also estimated the number of months it would take for the excess deaths to occur under normal conditions. Finally, we calculated the cumulative infection rate (CIR) needed to produce the IHME predicted number of deaths.

We used Microsoft Excel Solver to find the average CIR that would produce the projected number of COVID-19 deaths during April 2020. Similarly, Solver was used to determine the number of months needed to generate the excess deaths.
In our model the CIR is a fixed value for the entire month. To estimate the actual increasing CIR we modeled the cumulative density of the IHME deaths using a Gaussian distribution. That model was used as a template to produce dynamic percentages of cumulative infection by day whose average equaled the average CIR .

The dynamic CIR for the Spiegelhalter IFRs is 3.61% corresponding to 11.9 million infected. Figure 1 illustrates the CIRs from March 12,2020 through April 10, 2020. The IHME predicts that deaths will not increase after the end of June. The asymptotic CIRs at that time are 3.78%% using the Verity IFRs and 3.12% with Spiegelhalter's IFRs.
Our findings corroborate those of Spiegelhalter who suggested that if the virus went completely unchallenged in the United Kingdom, then contracting COVID-19 would be like packing a year of risk into two weeks or less. 8 We found that with full social distancing a year of mortality would be concentrated into one month.

It is reasonable to ask if 12 to 14 million of the US population could be infected by April 16 Other countries' experiences also inform whether a CIR of 4.2% could be reached in the US. Iceland has a robust nationwide testing program and 5.7% of over 27,000 tests (representing 7.5% of the nation's population) were positive through April 6, 2020. 17 Notably, approximately 50% of those with positive results were asymptomatic and there were only 4 deaths recorded. 18 European countries. This means that 1.88% to 11.43% of the population was infected with an average IR of 4.9%. 19 Data on the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or history thereof would help to obtain more accurate estimates of deaths and the parameters used to model .

Accurate death reporting is crucial in understanding this pandemic. Lee has suggested that COVID-19 deaths are coded differently than, say, influenza deaths on death certificates. 21 Specifically, in the United Kingdom COVID-19 is a notifiable disease. As a result, any patient who is positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be coded as a COVID-19 death.
Conversely, influenza is not a notifiable disease and a person dying with influenza would not necessarily be recorded as an influenza death. In the US there are concerns that COVID-19 deaths are underreported. 22, 23 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting analyses to better understand COVID-19 death reporting. 24 Although business closures and social distancing measures have apparently slowed the spread of the virus, economies across the world are also receding. 25, 26 In addition, medical resources are being diverted to care for COVID-19 patients. While excess deaths from these changes have yet to be quantified, they do occur. Thomas suggests that a temporary decrease in per capita Gross Domestic Product of not more than 6.4% will balance COVID-19 deaths and those due to economic slowdown. 27 A limitation of our estimates is that the IFRs are not gender-specific. Although males may have higher fatality rates, the data are not yet conclusive. 28 Moreover, we have no data on possible differences in infection rates by age or gender. Another concern is that the IHME predictions assume that social distancing (SD) measures will be maintained through the end of May 2020. Given the difficulties of implementing SD in some localities, the IHME predictions could be conservative (note that the upper 95% UI for .

Under normal conditions it would take 11 to 13 months for these excess deaths to occur. The CIRs needed to generate these deaths, 3.6% to 4.3%, means that 12 to 14 million will be infected in the US by mid-April 2020. It is plausible to expect this extent of infection although the majority would still be undetected.
