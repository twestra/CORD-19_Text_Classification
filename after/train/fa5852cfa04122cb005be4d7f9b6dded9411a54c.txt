To screen for COVID-19 patients in immigration using minimal nucleic acid testing (NAT). Methods: In the first phase, nasopharyngeal swab samples from the inbound population were numbered and grouped. The samples in the group were mixed together, and a NAT test was performed. When the test result is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the screening of the group is complete. When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT.
The advantages and considerations of the method are discussed. Prevalence in the incoming population was a determinant of the sample size within the group. The lower the incidence, the larger the sample size within the group, the higher the savings in NAT and testing costs.
This method has significant efficiency and cost advantages in COVID-19 screening. It can also be used to screen other populations, such as community populations and people at high risk of infection, etc.
Since the WHO declared COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, [1] the number of Chinese arrivals has reached 600,000 by March 15, 2020, [2] and 44 new confirmed cases have been detected from the arriving population. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Starting from March 19, 2020, cities such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing have implemented the policy of nucleic acid testing (NAT) for all inbound persons. [8] [9] [10] [11] 
The formula used is as follows:
R software (Version 3.6.3) code to calculate y is as follows:
1 p<-#input value of incidence rate 2 x<-c(2:(1/p))
where p is the incidence of the incoming population, d is the number of confirmed cases in the incoming population, t is the number of concurrent incoming population, q is the number of the same detection effect with the lowest number of NATs, a staged, batch screening approach is .

In the same group, a double nasopharyngeal swab was taken from each person, called sample A and sample B, and all sample A in the same group was mixed together for a single NAT test. When this test is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the test for that group is over. When a test result is positive, it means that at least one person in the group has a positive sample, and this group is called the "positive group", and all samples in the positive group go on to the second stage of testing.
In the second stage, NAT was performed on all samples B in the positive group one by one to find out which sample caused the positive result and to screen the corresponding patients.
After two stages of bulk screening in groups, only y NAT is required, q-y NAT is saved. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For example, assuming p was 0.733/100,000, then q was 13,637, according to formulas (1), (2), (3) and code of R software 3.63, when x was 117, the minimum value of y was 234; that was, 13 On average, each person entering the country pays only 2.8 RMB instead of 160 RMB for NAT, which equates to a savings of 2.14 million RMB in testing costs, a 98.3 per cent savings. The savings rate was higher if two or more patients were found in the same group, or if the method was repeated in the positive group. The cost of NAT was at least 960,000 RMB, based on the average of more than 6,000 test visits per day in Beijing. Using this method, Beijing can save 940,000 RMB per day in testing costs and 28.2 million RMB in 30 days. Based on the daily average of 120,000 passengers entering China through land ports, seaports and airports, the cost of testing can be saved by 18.83 million RMB in 30 days, which was RMB 565 million.
The method is not limited to screening of inbound populations, but can also be used to screen community populations and at-risk populations. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] It should be noted that p is the determinant of the number of people in each group x. The lower the p, the greater the value of x, the greater the value of q-y and vice versa (Table 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 ).

Figure 3 Scatterplot of incidence rates in the incoming population versus sample size per group. It can be seen that the incidence in the inbound population is related to the sample size per group, the lower the incidence, the larger the sample size per group, the more NATs can be saved.
There are many factors that affect p, such as international situation, country, city, observation period, customs policy, and the characteristics of the population entering the country. Sometimes these factors cause large fluctuations in p and require timely monitoring of p and adjustment of x according to Equation (2). when p fluctuates within a certain range, x should be adjusted according to the maximum value of p.
