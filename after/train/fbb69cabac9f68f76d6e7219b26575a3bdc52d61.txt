Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, with the potential to infect nearly 60% of the population. 1 The disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality and current estimates are that nearly 20% of patients require hospitalization, 5% critical care. 2, 3 Over the past 2 months, multiple countries have witnessed their healthcare systems being overwhelmed by patients infected by COVID-19. The first case was diagnosed in the United States on January 21, 2020, but it has spread rapidly across the US. 4, 5 The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity.
We There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota ( Figure   1 ). There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging
