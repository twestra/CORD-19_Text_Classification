SARS-COV-2 and all other coronaviruses express its 3 prime genes by forming sub-genomic RNA. As 13 the genome of these virus exist in RNA form, only by profiling the relative abundance of these sgRNAs, can 14 the viral transcriptome be revealed. Utilizing publically available meta-transcriptomic data generated from 15 patient samples, we were able to infer the viral transcriptome in vivo, which is distinct from the in vitro one 16 derived from cell culture. Inter-sample diversity was also observed and a sample specific transcript was 17 identified. By doing the same analysis to MERS and SARS data, we were able to compare the three in terms 18 of transcription. Among the differences, SARS-COV-2 has significantly elevated expression of the Spike gene, 19 which may contribute to its high transmissibility. 20 21 Highlights 22 1) The in vivo transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by sgRNA profiling, for 25 patient samples around 23 the globe. 24
2) The Spike protein expression is an order of magnitude higher in SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV or SARS-25
CoV, possibly contributing to the virus' elevated transmissibility. 26
3) The in vivo SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes, as inferred from human patient data was distinct from the in 27 vitro one derived from cell line culture, all the accessory genes were up-regulated in vivo, suggesting 28 intricate expression regulation mechanism for the small viral genome.
The transcriptome of the virus is a fundamental aspect of its biology. For We developed an informatics pipeline to infer sgRNA profiles from these short reads samples. In short, 73 reads were first aligned to a combined reference of human (hg38) and either SARS-CoV-2 (GeneBank ID 74 It's followed by ORF7a, M, ORF3a and S, all just above 10%. E is the lowest of the eight at about 1%. All of 84 them also have TRS except E. The break point for these ORFs were situated between 9 to 146 nt upstream 85 of the ORF start, and have no start codon (ATG) in-between. ORF7b and ORF10 are two ORFs that were 86 supported in a recent proteomics study on SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not see supporting break 87 points/sgRNA in our first scan-through. We then looked extra hard by lowing our threshold. The few extra 88 break points emerged were still very far away from those ORF start or has out-of-frame start codon between 89 the break point and the ORF start. Thus ORF7b and ORF10 were not supported by our data, this could be 90 1.6% and 1.25% respectively. We notice this difference is in accordance with the three's capability to spread 122 among hosts: MERS being the most deadly, has a R0 of 0.69, SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest fatality rate, 123 spread very rapidly and SARS comes in between in terms of both transmissibility and fatality rate [10-12]. 124 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use ACE2 as the receptor for celluar invasion. Cryo-EM study suggested 125 that the SARS-CoV-2 has higher binding affinity to ACE2 [13]. Our study suggest yet another possibility. The 126 elevated S expression, may make an average SARS-COV-2 having more Spikes on surface or just assemble 127 more efficiently. 128
We also compared the recent in vitro transcriptome with our in vivo one, Fig 2B, 
An interesting observation is that all accessory genes were down-regulated in vitro. This could make 130 biological sense as in defenseless cultured cells, viruses devote more resource into reproduction, while to 131 cope with more host defense in vivo, accessory genes have to more important roles to play. This also 132 suggested there was intricate expression regulation mechanism at work here, even for this small 30 Kb 133 genome. 134 Finally, there are more than just viral information within this type of meta-transcriptomic data. Host 164 RNA and RNA from other microbes were also there, though not optimally captured. In a time of urgent 165 need, these valuable information should not be wasted, and could be made more useful if more 166 accompanying clinical information could be shared. Most GISAID entries for SARS-CoV-2 has a meta-167 transcriptomic dataset behind it and currently GISAID entries far out-numbered the raw reads entries in say 168 SRA. Sharing these information will greatly help researchers study this virus and ultimately curb it. 169 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
