13 India reported its first COVID19 case on 30 January 2020. Since then the 14 epidemic has taken different trajectories across different geographical locations 15 in the country. This study explores the population aggregated trajectories of 16 COVID19 susceptible, infected and recovered or dead cases in the south Indian 17 state of Telangana with a population of approximately 40 million. Information 18 on cases reported from March 2 to April 4 was collated from government 19 records. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for the spread of an 20 infectious disease was used. Transmission parameters were extracted from 21 existing literature that has emerged over past weeks from other regions with 22 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

similar population densities as Telangana. Optimisation algorithms were used to 23 get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical 24 interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards 25 end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the 26 population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The 27 number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: 28 (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined 29 with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 30 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. 31 Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are 32 population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of 33 susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will 34 need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full 35 complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models. The announcement of the novel corona Virus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic was 51 made on January 30 th 2020 [1] . The first case of COVID-19 was detected in India on January 52 30 th , 2020. As of 30 th March 2020, more than 1250 cases had been identified in India, with 32 53 deaths and 102 cases have been discharged after treatment [2] . Many key aspects about the 54 disease dynamics are not known. To improve the understanding about the virus many 55 researchers continue to contribute through peer review journals, blogs, reports and social media 56 platforms [3]. One of the key endeavours among these knowledge products is the quest to 57 quantify the burden of disease through the use of mathematical modelling [4,5,6] so that public 58 health systems can prepare for emergency response. 59
India is a geographically, climatically and culturally diverse country with nearly 1.3 billion 60 population [7] . The population density not only differs from urban to rural areas but also from 61 state to state with Delhi having more than 11,000 people per square kilometre, while Arunachal 62
Pradesh has only 17 people per square kilometre. The country has 53 cities which have more 63 than a million population with a minimum density of 400 persons per square kilometre, 64
according to the census of 2011. The country has 137 airports, including 23 international 65 airports handing more than 6 million international and 20 million domestic passengers every 66 month. The above information indicates the diversity of population distribution that can 67
influence the spread of an infectious disease like COVID-19 and the possibility of import via 68 international passenger influx [8] . China or elsewhere. Thus, we assumed that all those who are infected will be "removed" from 92 the pool of susceptible either due to recovery or death. Because of the short nature of the 93 epidemic elsewhere we assumed that the epidemic is not affected by larger population-level 94 vital dynamics i.e. births, migration etc. 95

The epidemic curve presented in the different scenarios give a range of the burden of the 209 disease and the scenario of optimisation with the state level data gives a very optimistic 210 scenario. Although the range of scenarios with and without interventions gives us a spread of 211 projections, we however feel that the no interventions scenario may be close to the actual 212 scenario till the second week of April as accumulated cases will reflect undiagnosed 213
infections and unreported deaths in the community. This model considers data till ten days 214 after the shutdown announcement by Government of India on 25 March 2020, which is closer 215
to the incubation period of the disease, indicating that the infections detected in last ten days 216
are not influenced by the shutdown. However, there are other measures like a ban on 217 international travel, campaign on handwashing etc. that was ongoing for almost four weeks, 218 thus the influence of the same on the epidemic progression must be factored in. After the 219 peak around 120 days from the first detected case, the epidemic is expected to show a decline 220 in numbers and be on the downward slope of the curve. In a national COVID model [24] , the authors suggest two types of containment strategy i.e. 233
(i) Port of entry and, (ii) mitigationwithin-country connectivity. One of the arguments for 234 the epidemic response was to have a robust screening at ports of entry and contact tracing 235
program. Our preliminary model for Telangana state does not incorporate strategy (i). The 236 capital city of Hyderabad has one international airport with total traffic of more than 20 237 million in the year 2018-19, including 4 million international travellers.

implemented locally by the authorities, thus its influence over the trajectory of the epidemic 267 cannot be overlooked. As policymakers walk the tightrope of initiating public health 268 interventions to contain the COVID19 epidemic, more granular analyses will be needed, 269 especially in a country as socially and geographically diverse as India. 270
