Low monocytic (m)HLA-DR expression is the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients. We recently showed that, in bacterial septic shock patients, low mHLA-DR expression is prevalent and associated with the development of secondary infections [1] . At the end of March 2020, there were in excess of 800.000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, of whom more than 12.000 from the Netherlands. Several reports suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 may suffer from a hyperinflammatory "cytokine storm" [2, 3] . However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-10 and IL-4) have also been reported in COVID-19 [3] .
Although there are few indications that secondary infections are common in COVID-19 patients, one study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infections [4] , which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. Herein, we explored mHLA-DR expression kinetics in a cohort of 24 critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Between March 18 th -27 th , all COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included in this prospective observational study. COVID-19 was confirmed by two positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs and by CT-scan findings. Fourteen patients were transferred from other ICUs. The median ICU length of stay at the time of study inclusion was 3 days. The study was carried out in accordance with the applicable rules concerning the review of research ethics committees and informed consent in the Netherlands.
The ethics committee (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen) board waived the need for informed consent because of the observational nature of the study and the non-invasiveness of blood withdrawal (all patients had an arterial canula in place, so no venapunctures were performed). All patients or legal representatives were informed about the study details and allowed to abstain from participation. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood was stored at 4-8 o C until mHLA-DR expression analysis (performed within 2 hours after withdrawal). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In line with previous observations [3] , the majority of patients was male and many had comorbidities. The median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to ICU admission was 11 days. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited increases in inflammatory parameters ( Table 1) . As of March 27 th 2020, two patients died (at 3 and 4 days post-ICU admission, data of only one timepoint of these patients was recorded), and 22 patients were still in the ICU.
Although mHLA-DR expression levels in COVID-19 patients were lower than those observed in healthy subjects (15000-45000 mAb/cell [5] ), the extent of suppression was less pronounced than observed in bacterial septic shock patients ( Figure 1A , sepsis data from [1] ). mHLA-DR expression kinetics revealed no change over time ( Figure 1B ). Circulating Creactive protein concentrations declined over time ( Figure 1C ), whereas no significant changes in circulating procalcitonin, leukocytes, or ferritin levels were observed ( Figure 1D -F). None of the patients developed a secondary infection.
In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, our preliminary results indicate more moderate innate immune suppression compared with bacterial septic shock patients. These findings are in accordance with a low incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced inflammation appears less pronounced in COVID-19.
