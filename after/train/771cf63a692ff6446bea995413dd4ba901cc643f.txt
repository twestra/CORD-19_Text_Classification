A. Why was this study conducted? 47 Pregnant women and newborns are exposed to COVID-19 and at risk for adverse 48 outcomes. The review of evidence is essential to guide preventive action and therapy. 49 B. What are the key findings? 50 Fetal distress and preterm delivery seem to be more frequent among women. Also, evidence on vertical transmission is emerging but the clinical relevance of 52 the fetal infection remains unclear. No evidence links the SARS-CoV-2 virus to 53 transmission via breast milk. 54 C. What does this study add to what is already known? 55 The comprehensive review of 212 pregnant women with COVID-19, summarizes the 56 evidence on vertical transmission, as well as adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
57 Additionally, it adds the characteristics of the first eight cases of COVID-19 positive 58 women delivered in Portugal.
Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential 62 adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of 63 COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant 64 women diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the characteristics of COVID-19 positive 65 women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. 66 Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMedÂ® up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA 67 standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any 68 gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the 69 search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. 70 Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based 71 on the information provided by their health professionals. 72 Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with 73 COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. 74 The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women 75 with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of 76 maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 77 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, 78 placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four 79 newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM 80 antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk 81 samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-82 CoV-2. : medRxiv preprint 5 Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still 84 limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable 85 populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies. 86 87 Keywords: 88 361

All identified original studies reporting cases of pregnant women at any gestational age 142 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included irrespective of study quality. Cases reported in 143 more than one study, and for which it was possible to identify duplicates, were described 144 only once, presenting the more detailed data. We identified duplicates based on author 145 names and hospital location, publication date, participant admission date, maternal and 146 neonatal characteristics and outcomes.
Doubts on possible duplicates and/or differences in the data extraction were discussed 148 and resolved by consensus, involving a third researcher (CR) whenever necessary.

Cesarean section was the most common type of delivery: 88.0% of 158 cases with 216 available information. This was also observed in Portuguese cases in which 6 (75%) were 217 born by cesarean. Most studies did not specify the indication for the cesarean section. There is no evidence that the risk of infection with COVID-19 in pregnant women is 237 greater than in the general population. 7, 37 However, the incidence of infection in pregnant 238 women is unknown, as screening tests were not generally used, except in the presence of 239 symptoms.

There is not enough scientific evidence to unequivocally 305 state that there is no possibility that mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus 306 through breast milk. 55 Therefore, recommendations should be based on the available data 307 5, 15, 16, [20] [21] [22] 28 and the analogy with past circumstances and predictable costs and benefits.

Limitations of this systematic review should be acknowledged. Considerable 319 heterogeneity was observed across the studies, which did not allow us to conduct a meta-320 analysis.
