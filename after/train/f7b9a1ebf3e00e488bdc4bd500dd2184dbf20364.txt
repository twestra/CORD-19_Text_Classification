The global pandemic of COVID-19 cases caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, with no approved antiviral intervention. We describe here the effects of treatment with interferon-α2b in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China.
In this retrospective study, 77 adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were treated with either nebulized IFN-α2b (5mU b.i.d.), arbidol (200mg t.i.d.) or a combination of IFN-α2b plus arbidol. Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing along with hematological measurements, including cell counts and blood biochemistry, serum cytokine levels, temperature and blood oxygen saturation levels were recorded for each patient during their hospital stay.
Treatment with IFN-α2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP.
These findings suggest that IFN-α2b should be further investigated as a therapy in COVID-19 cases.

In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, resulting from infection with a novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel, enveloped betacoronavirus with phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV. 1 Unlike the coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU, that are pathogenic in humans and are associated with mild clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 resembles both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with the potential to cause more severe disease. A critical distinction is that CoVs that infect the upper respiratory tract tend to cause a mild disease, whereas CoVs that infect both upper and lower respiratory tracts (such as SARS-CoV-2 appears to be) may cause more severe disease. Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has since spread around the globe as a pandemic.
In the absence of a SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine or an approved antiviral, a number of antivirals are currently being evaluated for their therapeutic effectiveness. Type I IFNsα/β are broad spectrum antivirals, exhibiting both direct inhibitory effects on viral replication and supporting an immune response to clear virus infection. 2 indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate), a broad spectrum direct-acting antiviral, induces IFN production and phagocyte activation. ARB displays antiviral activity against respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. 4 All rights reserved.

Individuals with suspected COVID-19 were admitted to Union Hospital, Tongii Medical College, Wuhan, China, during the period January 16 -February 20, 2020, based on initial symptoms that included fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache, nasal discharge, myalgia, fatigue, shortness of breath and/or diarrhea. We retrospectively examined the outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who received antiviral treatment with either IFN-α2b (Tianjin Sinobloway Biology, 5mIU/ml), arbidol (ARB) (arbidol hydrochloride; Jiangsu Simcere Pharm. Co.,100mg dispersible tablets), or a combination of IFN-α2b plus ARB, at the discretion of the treating physician, in accordance with the current practice guidelines. 5mIU IFN-α2b (1ml) were added to 2ml of sterile water and introduced as an aerosol by use of a nebulizer and mask. IFN-α2b treatment was bid, i.e. 10mIU/day. ARB treatment was 200mg (2 tablets) tid, i.e. 600mg/day. Additional COVID-19 confirmed cases from Wuhan Temporary Shelter Hospital (February 2-17, 2020), who were transferred to Union Hospital and treated with only ARB, were also included in this retrospective study. Ethics approval for analysis of all data collected was waived by hospital Institutional Review Boards, since all patient data collected conformed with the policies for a public health outbreak investigation of emerging infectious diseases issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.

More specifically, whereas circulating levels of IL-6 remained low for all patients who received IFN, those who received ARB alone (i.e. with no IFN) exhibited a significant spike in circulating IL-6 levels ( Figure 2A , Figure 7) . We also noted elevated levels of CRP over approximately the same time that IL-6 was elevated (Supplementary Appendix, Figure   7 ). Similar to IL-6, CRP also returned to within normal range as disease resolved. These data suggested that treatment with IFN, whether alone or in combination with ARB, limited the circulating CRP level ( Figure 2B ).
Sex and co-morbidities had no effect on the effects of ARB and IFN treatment on time to viral clearance, or IL-6 and CRP levels. Cognizant that the ARB-only treatment group consisted generally of older patients, we adjusted for age in the statistical analyses.
Regardless of whether age was considered as a continuous variable or a categorical variable (<50 yrs vs >50 yrs; <60 yrs vs >60 yrs), the effects of IFN treatment on IL-6, CRP, and time to viral clearance remained statistically significant. For those cases treated with ARB alone, IL-6 levels were significantly higher than for those treated with IFN from day 12-47 (p=2.2 x 10 -9 ). Similarly, for the ARB alone treatment group, CRP levels were significantly higher than for those cases treated with IFN from day 0-20 (p=0.0033).
Time to viral clearance was significantly shorter for those cases treated with IFN-α2b compared to those treated only with ARB (p=0.003).

This retrospective study provides several important and novel insights into COVID-19 disease. Most importantly, IFN-α2b therapy appears to shorten duration of viral shedding. Notably, reduction of markers of acute inflammation such as CRP and IL6 correlated with this shortened viral shedding, suggesting IFN-α2b acted along a functional cause-effect chain where virally induced inflammation represents a pathophysiological driver. Taken together, these findings elevate the biological plausibility of IFN-α2b representing a therapy for COVID-19 disease.
As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic takes an ever-increasing toll, the urgent search for effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions is rapidly accelerating. This includes lopinavir/ritonavir, 7,8 chloroquine, 9 remdesivir ,10 as well as interferon (IFN)-α 2 and arbidol (ARB) 4 and combinations of these. Most of these antivirals only have in vitro data to support consideration for coronavirus targets prior to clinical testing; as such, while unfortunate, it is not surprising that there is a high chance of failure. 11 However, we had shown during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Canada that IFN-α treatment could hasten resolution of coronavirus-mediated human disease. 3 This prompted us to evaluate IFN-α therapy that was administered for COVID-19 disease in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Indeed, our analysis suggests that inhaled IFN-α2b accelerated viral clearance from the respiratory tract and hastened resolution of systemic inflammatory processes when compared to ARB treatment alone. While we recognize that these data are at best suggestive, given the urgency, the findings indicate that a follow-up randomized placebo controlled clinical trial (RCT) is now warranted.

The reduction of the inflammatory biomarker IL-6 following inhaled IFN-α2b therapy not only supported a clinically relevant impact of this approach, but also hinted at likely functional connections between viral infection and host end organ damage. IL-6 has been shown to provide prognostic value in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the most severe form of COVID-19 disease. 12 If this were indeed the case, then targeting interventions such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors (e.g. toclizumab or sarilumab) towards this axis may prove a useful therapeutic adjunct, at least in those most severely ill. This form of therapy has recently been approved by China's National Health Commission 13 and is currently under consideration by the Italian Medical Agency. 14 The advantage of IFN-α2b over blocking IL-6 rests in IFN targeting the cause (SARS-CoV-2), not only the symptoms (IL-6).
This retrospective study has several significant limitations. Most obvious is the fact that the study cohort was small, non-randomized, with unbalanced demographics between treatment arms that were of unequal size. However, we considered this an exploratory study only, with the objective of determining in as rapid a manner as possible if a full trial should be considered. The results indicate that an IFN-α RCT is now warranted.
Furthermore, since the entire cohort consisted only of moderate cases of COVID-19 disease, our findings may not be indicative of what occurs in more severely ill patients; All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Furthermore, beyond clinical benefit to the individual patient, treatment with IFN-α2b may also benefit public health measures aimed at slowing the tide of this pandemic, in that duration of viral shedding appears shortened.
