The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in the city of Wuhan, Hubei 18 province, China, causing an outbreak of pneumonia in January 2020. As of April 10, 2020, the virus has 19 rapidly disseminated to over 200 countries and territories, causing more than 1.6 million confirmed cases 20 of COVID-19 and 97,000 deaths worldwide. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, 21 and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the 22 population. Further, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or 23 are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection 24 control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-25 19 positive patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical 26 performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by 27 the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients. This information is crucial for both 28 laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made. 29 30
RNA internal control (Q670 probe) is used to detect RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition. The results 115 interpretation algorithm for reporting a positive specimen requires only one of the two targets to be 116 detected (S or ORF1ab gene). 117
118 GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 EUA panel. Testing with the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 panel was performed 119
according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. Briefly, after vortexing for 3-5 seconds, 200 μl of the 120 primary NPS sample was aspirated into the sample delivery device (SDD) provided with the ePlex SARS-121
CoV-2 panel kit and vortexed once again for 10 seconds. The entire volume of the SDD was dispensed into 122 the sample loading port of the SARS-CoV-2 test cartridge, followed by firmly pushing down on the cap to 123 securely seal the sample delivery port. Each cartridge was bar-coded and scanned with the ePlex 124 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). Hybridized nucleic acid was then separated from the specimen in a magnetic 133 field. After wash steps, the elution step occurs and outputs 50µL of purified RNA. Then 5µL of eluted 134 nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted 135 mastermix. The Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay amplifies and detects two conserved regions of the 136
ORF1ab gene in the same fluorescence channel. The two regions are not differentiated and amplification 137 of either or both regions leads to a fluorescent ROX signal. The results interpretation algorithm for 138 reporting a positive specimen requires only one of the two targets to be detected (ORF1a or ORF1b gene). 139

A serial dilution panel of SARS-CoV-2 control was tested to determine the LoD, 170 defined as the minimum concentration with detection of 100% by positive rate and 95% by Probit analysis. 171
The LoD established by percent positive rate ranged from 1,000 copies/mL by both the GenMark and the 172 modified CDC assays to 50 copies/mL by the DiaSorin Molecular assay ( Table 2) . The LoD results were 173 further subjected to Probit analysis. The 95% detection limit of the CDC assay was 779 ± 27 copies/mL for 174 the N1 gene and 356 ± 20 copies/mL for the N2 gene. For the DiaSorin Molecular assay, the 95% detection 175 limit was 39 ± 23 copies/mL for the S gene and 602 ± 28 copies/mL for ORF1ab. For the Hologic assay, the 176 95% detection limit was 83 ± 36 copies/mL for ORF1ab. Probit analysis could not be performed for the 177 GenMark assay ( Table 2) . The final LoD, according to the assay results interpretation algorithm from each 178 manufacturer, ranged from 1,000 copies/mL by the GenMark assay to 39 ± 23 copies/mL by the DiaSorin 179 Molecular assay ( Table 2) . 180 All rights reserved.

A total of five discordant samples were found 203 among three out of the four platforms. One false positive sample (NW-104) had Ct values of 38.9 and 39.6 204 for N1 and N2 genes, respectively, on initial testing by the modified CDC assay. After repeating extraction 205 and retesting, the sample was determined to be negative. Two samples (NW-97 & NW-99) were 206 considered false negative by GenMark but positive by the other three methods. After reprocessing and 207 retesting, the GenMark assay was able to detect both samples as positive. Two additional false positive 208 samples (NW-83 & NW-85) were found by the Hologic assay; original samples were retested and were 209 found to be positive and negative, respectively. Following retesting of the five discordant samples, the 210 GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 EUA panel showed an improvement of sensitivity to 100% (51/51). 211
Additionally, a 100% specificity (53/53) was obtained for the CDC assay, while Hologic improved to 98% 212 (52/53) ( Table 4) . 213

The longest hands-219 on time was the Hologic assay at ~2 hours followed by the modified CDC assay with ~1 hour and 30 220 minutes. Very comparable HOT was found for DiaSorin Molecular and GenMark with a range of 16 221 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively. The run time averaged 90 minutes for modified CDC, DiaSorin 222 Molecular, and GenMark. Hologic was the exception with 4 hours with 35 mins of run time ( Table 5) . 223
Overall turn-around time assessment, from sample to results, showed DiaSorin Molecular with the least 224 overall turn-around time to results, followed by GenMark, modified CDC assay and Hologic with the 225 greatest overall time ( Table 5) . 226 All rights reserved.

Our data suggest that all four PCR methods yielded comparable results (κ ≥ 0.96); however, we 250 did observe a notable difference in the sensitivity of the methods during this large-scale evaluation of EUA 251 in vitro diagnostic assays.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069864 doi: medRxiv preprint performed both the modified CDC and GenMark assays when it came to overall LoD, with GenMark having 253 the overall highest LoD of all four platforms evaluated. DiaSorin Molecular had the lowest LoD (39 ± 23 254 copies/mL), closely followed by Hologic (83 ± 36 copies/mL). The modified CDC assay showed a final LoD, 255 of 779 ± 27 copies/mL based on the results interpretation algorithm. It is worth mentioning that this assay 256 requires both targets to be fully detected, thus clinical samples falling in this concentration range would 257 be identified and repeated, potentially generating additional turnaround time and laboratory labor. In 258 contrast, GenMark could only detect 100% of replicates at 1,000 copies/mL, and was not able to reliably 259 detect replicates below 1,000 copies/mL, thus patient specimens below this concentration range could 260 potentially be missed. One important limitation to mention is that sensitivity using Probit analysis could 261 not be calculated for GenMark since Ct values are not available as part of the ePlex system result 262
interpretation. 263
The clinical correlation was also consistent with LoD findings, where both the DiaSorin Molecular 265 and Hologic assays had 100% sensitivity and detected all specimens deemed positive by the consensus 266 standard (interpretation of three of four evaluated assays as "gold standard"), whereas GenMark missed 267 two positive specimens (which were subsequently detected by GenMark upon repeat). DiaSorin 268 Molecular and GenMark showed 100% specificity, while Hologic and the CDC assay initially had two and 269 one discordant results, respectively. Repeat testing of these three specimens showed that for Hologic, 270 NW-83 repeated as positive a second time and was therefore potentially a false positive and NW-85 was 271 negative upon repeat, meaning this result could have previously been a false positive as well. The 272 continued discordant result from NW-83 could potentially be attributed to specificity issues, since the 273 assay did not prove to be the most sensitive assay among those used in the study, with DiaSorin Molecular 274
showing a slightly lower LoD. Repeat testing of NW-104 on the modified CDC assay was negative. 275

When it comes to the hands-on and turnaround time of the four assays in this study, the 281 throughput and workflow evaluation are clearly shown in Table 5 and are based on lab technologist 282 experience in our laboratory. As a routine real-time RT-PCR assay, the modified CDC requires nucleic acid 283 extraction, master mix preparation and PCR setup, standard PCR amplification, as well as interpretation to purchase additional instruments to allow for testing of more samples at a time in order to satisfy patient 289 testing volume requirements. The Hologic Panther Fusion platform has more of an automated workflow, 290 with five samples processed at a time after loading. The sample to answer time for the first five samples 291 is 2 hours and 40 min, followed by 5 results every 5 minutes after loading 120 samples; the total assay run 292 time for 120 specimens is approximately 4 hours and 35 min. It is also important to note that the Hologic 293 platform has longer hands-on time, since the technologist has to load the primers, probes, and other 294 consumables and the fact that 120 clinical samples have to be manually transferred to Sample Lysis Buffer 295 tubes. These steps, especially the pipetting of the specimen into the lysis tube, can be somewhat labor 296 intensive and time consuming, bumping the overall turnaround time for 120 specimens closer to the 7 297 hour mark. It is important to emphasize that each platform has their advantages. For workflow, TAT, and 298 ease of use, the three sample-to-answer platforms (DiaSorin Molecular, Hologic, GenMark) out-299 performed the modified CDC assay, which is a manual assay requiring many steps, specialized personnel, 300
