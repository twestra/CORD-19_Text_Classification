Generating new ideas and scientific hypotheses is often the result of extensive literature and 13 database reviews, overlaid with scientists' own novel data and a creative process of making 14 connections that were not made before. We have developed a comprehensive approach to guide 15 this technically challenging data integration task and to make knowledge discovery and 16 hypotheses generation easier for plant and crop researchers. KnetMiner can digest large volumes 17 of scientific literature and biological research to find and visualise links between the genetic and 18 biological properties of complex traits and diseases. Here we report the main design principles 19 behind KnetMiner and provide use cases for mining public datasets to identify unknown links 20 between traits such grain colour and pre-harvest sprouting in Triticum aestivum, as well as, an 21 evidence-based approach to identify candidate genes under an Arabidopsis thaliana petal size 22 QTL. We have developed KnetMiner knowledge graphs and applications for a range of species 23 including plants, crops and pathogens. KnetMiner is the first open-source gene discovery platform 24 that can leverage genome-scale knowledge graphs, generate evidence-based biological networks 25 and be deployed for any species with a sequenced genome. KnetMiner is available at 26 KEYWORDS 28 knowledge graph, interactive knowledge discovery, exploratory data mining, omics data 29 integration, candidate gene prioritization, information visualisation, systems biology 30 31 governing eight agronomic traits using a GBS-GWAS approach and validation by QTL
which is prone to information being overlooked and subjective biases being introduced. Even when 38 the task of gathering information is complete, it is demanding to assemble a coherent view of how 39 each piece of evidence might come together to "tell a story" about the biology that can explain how 40 multiple genes might be implicated in a complex trait or disease. New tools are needed to provide 41 scientists with a more fine-grained and connected view of the scientific literature and databases, 42 rather than the conventional information retrieval tools currently at their disposal. 43
Scientists are not alone with these challenges. Search systems form a core part of the duties of 44 many professions. Studies have highlighted the need for search systems that give confidence to 45 the professional searcher and therefore trust, explainability, and accountability remain a significant 46 challenge when developing such systems (Russell-Rose et al., 2018). The amount of time spent 47 on a task also influences human choice about whether to continue the task (Sweis et al., 2018). 48
When implemented well, search systems can give a head start to researchers by cutting the time 49 and cost to review genes, traits or molecules of interest before initiating expensive experiments. 50
Additionally, they offer a framework for the prioritization of future research, which can highlight 51 gaps in knowledge. 52
Knowledge graphs (KG) are increasingly used to make search and information discovery more 53 efficient (Fensel et al., 2020).

KGs model heterogeneous knowledge domains by 56 integrating information into advanced unified data schemas (i.e. ontologies) and leverage that to 57 apply formal and statistical inference methods to derive new knowledge (Ehrlinger & Wöß, 2016) . 58
Compared to more traditional data models, knowledge graphs are very flexible at integrating and 59 searching connected heterogeneous data, where data schemas are not established a-priori (Yoon 60 et al., 2017), and often subject to frequent changes. KGs in various forms have been widely 61 adopted in many disciplines, ranging from social sciences to engineering, physics, computer 62 (Singh et al., 2018) . Our data integration approach to build KGs is based on an intelligent data 92 model with just enough semantics to capture complex biological relationships between genes, 93 traits, diseases and many more information types derived from curated or predicted information 94 sources ( Figure 1 ). In this paper, we describe the KnetMiner knowledge discovery platform 95 (knetminer.org) for searching large genome-scale KGs and visualising interesting subgraphs of 96 connected information about the biology of traits and diseases. KnetMiner is customizable and 97 portable and therefore provides a cost-effective delivery platform for application to new species. 98
We provide use-cases to demonstrate how KnetMiner has helped scientists to tell the story of 99 complex traits and diseases in Arabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). The 100 methods section describes the algorithms behind core discovery features of KnetMiner, i.e. 101 identifying interesting subgraphs and using these to rank candidate genes. 102 .

However, after decades of research, it 137 still remains unclear whether there is a potential link between the grain color gene R (Myb) and 138 other phenotypes such as PHS. 139 140 We used KnetMiner to search for TRAESCS3D02G468400 -the wheat R gene (the orthologue of 141
Arabidopsis TT2) on chromosome 3D, and to explore its knowledge network generated by 142
KnetMiner. The TT2 network has a total of 823 connected nodes of 11 different types (see Supp 143 Table 1) Network View which provides interactive features to hide or add specific evidence types from the 156 network. Nodes are displayed in a defined set of shapes, colors and sizes to distinguish different 157 types of evidence. A shadow effect on nodes indicates that more information is available but has 158 been hidden. The auto-generated network, however, is not yet telling a story that is specific to our 159 traits of interest and is limited to evidence that is phenotypic in nature. 160
To further refine and extend the search for evidence that links TT2 to grain color and PHS, we can 162 provide additional keywords relevant to the traits of interest.

The colour of the grain is known to be determined through accumulation of 165 proanthocyanidin, an intermediate in the flavonoid pathway, found in the seed coat. These terms 166 and phrases can be combined using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and used in conjunction 167 with a list of genes. Thus, we search for TRAESCS3D02G468400 (TT2) and the keywords: "seed 168 germination" OR "seed dormancy" OR color OR flavonoid OR proanthocyanidin. This time, 169
KnetMiner filters the extracted TT2 knowledge network (823 nodes) down to a smaller subgraph of 170 68 nodes and 87 relations in which every path from TT2 to another node corresponds to a line of 171 evidence to phenotype or molecular characteristics based on our keywords of interest ( Figure 3B) . Table 2 ). The subgraph indicates that TT2 in wheat is predicted to regulate the 181 transcriptional activation of MFT. It indicates that MFT has been linked in a recent publication to 182 grain germination and seed dormancy in wheat (Nakamura S, n.d.; Zong Y, n.d.). It also reveals 183 that the MFT ortholog in Arabidopsis is linked to decreased germination rate in the presence of 184 .

Searching 255 a KG for such patterns is akin to searching for relevant sentences containing evidence that 256 supports a particular point of view within a book. Such evidence paths can be short e.g. Gene A 257 was knocked out and phenotype X was observed; or alternatively the evidence path can be longer, 258 e.g. Gene A in species X has an ortholog in species Y, which was shown to regulate the 259 expression of a disease related gene (with a link to the paper). In the first example, the relationship 260 between gene and disease is directly evident and experimentally proven, while in the second 261 .

There are 262 many evidence types that should be considered for evaluating the relevance of a gene to a trait. In 263 a KG context, a gene is considered to be, for example, related to 'early flowering' if any of its 264 biologically plausible graph patterns contain nodes related to 'early flowering'. In this context, the 265 word 'related' doesn't necessarily mean that the gene in question will have an effect on 'flowering shown to a user; let alone if combining GCSs for tens to hundreds of genes. There is therefore a 293 need to filter and visualise the subset of information in the GCSs that is most interesting to a 294 specific user. However, the interestingness of information is subjective and will depend on the 295 biological question or the hypothesis that needs to be tested. A scientist with an interest in disease 296 biology is likely to be interested in links to publications, pathways, and annotations related to 297 diseases, while someone studying the biological process of grain filling is likely more interested in 298 links to physiological or anatomical traits. To reduce information overload and visualise the most 299 interesting pieces of information, we have devised two strategies. 1) In the case of a combined 300 gene and keyword search, we use the keywords as a filter to show only paths in the GCS that 301 connect genes with keyword related nodes, i.e. nodes that contain the given keywords in one of 302 their node properties. In the special case where too many publications remain even after keyword 303 filtering, we select the most recent N publications (default N=20). Nodes not matching the keyword 304 are hidden but not removed from the GCS. 2) In the case of a simple gene query (without 305 additional keywords), we initially show all paths between the gene and nodes of type 306 phenotype/trait, i.e. any semantic motif that ends with a trait/phenotype, as this is considered the 307 most important relationship to many KnetMiner users. 308
We have developed a simple and fast algorithm to rank genes and their GCS for their importance. 310
We give every node in the KG a weight composed of three components, referred to as SDR, 311 standing for the Specificity to the gene, Distance to the gene and Relevance to the search terms. 312
Specificity reflects how specific a node is to a gene in question. For example, a publication that is 313 cited (linked) by hundreds of genes receives a smaller weight than a publication which is linked to 314 one or two genes only. We define the specificity of a node x as:
where n is the 315 frequency of the node occurring in all N GCS. D i s t a n c e assumes information which is associated 316 more closely to a gene can generally be considered more certain, versus one that's further away, 317 e.g. inferred through homology and other interactions increases the uncertainty of annotation 318 .

A short semantic motif is therefore given a stronger weight, whereas a long motif 319 receives a weaker weight. Thus, we define the second weight as the inverse shortest path distance 320 of a gene g and a node x:
Both weights S and D are not influenced by the 321 search terms and can therefore be pre-computed for every node in the KG. Relevance reflects the 322 relevance or importance of a node to user-provided search terms using the well-established 323 measure of inverse document frequency (IDF) and term frequency (TF) (Salton & Yang, 1973 
The sum considers only GCS nodes that contain the search terms. In the absence of search terms, 331
we sum over all nodes of the GCS with R=1 for each node.

In a second step, to 373 enable the stories and their evidence to be investigated in full detail, the Network View visualises 374 highly complex information in a concise and connected format, helping facilitate biologically 375 meaningful conclusions. Consistent graphical symbols are used for representing evidence types 376 throughout the different views, so that users develop a certain level of familiarity, before being 377 exposed to networks with complex interactions and rich content.
