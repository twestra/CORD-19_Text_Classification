200 22 Main (MAX): 2,584 23 24 15 Abstract 25 Background: In Korea, a total of 8,799 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 102 deaths have been 26 recorded as of Mar 21, 2020. The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be 27 estimated. 28 29 Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21, 30 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the 31 city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. 32 33 Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic 34 except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of 35 the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in 36 Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death 37 was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. 38 39 Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health 40 interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea. 41 Geographic differences in CFR are likely influenced by clusters of nosocomial transmission. 42 43
Introduction specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employ the delay from hospitalization to 100 death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) -H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) is a cumulative density 101 function of the delay from hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days 102 and SD 5.4 days, according to a recent study that estimated the CFR in China [18] . We let Ï€a,ti be the time- All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 120 Austria) using the 'rstan' package. 121
As of March 21, 2020, a total of 8,799 cases and 102 deaths of COVID- 19 In this paper we have derived estimates of the CFR for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, 151 a country that has relies on intensive social distancing and mass testing of suspected COVID-19 cases to 152 mitigate incidence levels of the disease and deliver early medical care to the most vulnerable, potentially 153 lowering the risk of death. Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea. These 158 findings suggest that the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do is more severe compared with the other affected 159 areas in Korea. 160
One can note a considerable increase in fatality risks with older age by multiple folds, with the 161 oldest age group exhibiting the highest case fatality. It was also reported that the risk of symptomatic 162 infection also increases with age, although this may be partially affected by preferential ascertainment of 163 In addition, our estimates on CFR are relatively lower than the CFR obtained from affected areas in China 174 (ranging from 1.41%-5.25%), based on the cases and deaths observed to date [18, 29] . In general, the CFR 175 of the same disease might vary greatly in different countries or even different regions of the same country, 176 partially due to differences in health control policies, availability of healthcare, medical standards, and 177 detection efficiency. In Korea, an extensive COVID-19 testing regime has been instituted, and authorities 178 launched a massive contact tracing as case numbers grew. As a result, the country has tested more people In conclusion, our estimates of the risk for death from COVID-19 in Korea as of March 21, 2020, 221 were as high as 2.4% in Gyeongsangbuk-do and as low as 0.7% in the less severely affected areas in Korea, 222 and this difference in CFR is likely influenced by nosocomial transmission of the disease. In the absence 223 of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., vaccination and antiviral drugs), the control of COVID-19 is highly 224 dependent on public health interventions including social distancing measures, isolation of the infected, 225 delayed school openings, and extensive testing of potential contacts of confirmed cases. The estimates of 226 CFR associated with COVID-19 is thus critical to help inform the assessments of health impacts and to 227 determine both the intensity and appropriateness of mitigation strategies as the epidemic unfolds. 228
