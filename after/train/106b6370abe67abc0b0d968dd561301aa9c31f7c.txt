COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an influenza-like disease with a respiratory route of transmission, yet clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids, enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by confocal-and electron-microscopy. Consequently, significant titers of infectious viral particles were measured. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program. We conclude that intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Infected cells invariably displayed proliferative enterocyte progenitor-phenotypes (EXP, Fig.  3B , top) or ApoA1+ enterocyte-phenotypes (DIF, Fig. 3B , bottom). Of note, SARS-CoV also readily infected enterocyte precursors (Fig. S3A -B) as shown previously (26, 27) . Some infected enterocyte progenitors were in mitosis (Fig. S3C) . While EEC-organoids produced appreciable titers, we never observed infection of Chromogranin-A+ EECs (Fig. S3D-E) . We also did not notice infection of Goblet cells across culture conditions. At 60 hours, apoptosis became prominent in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected enterocytes (Fig. S5 ). ACE2 protein was readily revealed as a bright and ubiquitous brush border marker in hSIOs in DIF medium (Fig. 3C ). In hSIOs in EXP medium, ACE2 staining was much lower -yet still apical-in occasional cells in a subset of organoids that displayed a more mature morphology (Fig. 3C ). In immature (cystic) organoids within the same cultures, the ACE2 signal was below the detection threshold. Percentage of infected organoids under EXP and DIF conditions are given in Fig S4. Fig. S5 gives images and quantification of apoptotic cells upon infection.
Unsupervised transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (26) was performed on selected highly infected samples. Figure (27) are visualized in Figure 4E and 4P. The nuclei in both organoids differed from nuclei in mock-infected organoids by a slightly rounder shape. The nuclear contour index (28) was 4.0+/-0.5 vs 4.3+/-0.5 for control set. There was more heterochromatin (4N), and one or two dense nucleoli in the center (4O).
We then performed mRNA sequence analysis to determine gene expression changes induced by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infection of hSIOs cultured continuously in EXP medium and hSIOs cultured in DIF medium. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited a broad signature of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) attributed to type I and III interferon responses ( (29) , rotavirus (30) and enteroviruses (31, 32) . A recent study (33) describes an antiviral signature induced in human cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the ISG response is broader in intestinal organoids, the induced gene sets are in close agreement between the two datasets ( Fig.  S8 ). One striking similarity was the low expression of Type I and III interferons: we only noticed a small induction of the Type III interferon IFNL1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected organoids. In SARS-CoV-infected organoids, we did not observe any type I or type III interferon induction. We confirmed these findings by ELISA on culture supernatant and qRT-PCR, which in addition to IFNL1 picked up low levels of type I interferon IFNB1 in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV infected organoids (Fig. S9) . The specific induction of IP-10/CXCL10 and ISG15 by SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively (Fig. S10 ). As in (33) , a short list of cytokine genes was induced by both viruses . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

For a comparison with (33) , see Fig S11. Altogether these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a stronger interferon response than SARS-CoV in HIOs.
Finally, the infection was repeated in a second experiment in the same ileal HIO line and analyzed after 72 hours. Analysis involved viral titration (Fig S12) , confocal imaging ( Fig  S13) and RNA sequencing (Fig S14) . This experiment essentially confirmed the observations presented above. A limited, qualitative experiment applying confocal analysis demonstrated infectability of two other lines available in the lab (one ileal, one duodenal) from independent donors (Fig S13) .
This study shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infect enterocyte lineage cells in a human intestinal organoid model. It appears of interest that we see at least equal infection rates of enterocyte-precursors and enterocytes whereas ACE2 expression increases ~1000fold upon differentiation at the mRNA level (Fig. S2 ). This suggests that low levels of ACE2 may be sufficient for viral entry. The scale of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests that this virus may continue to circulate in humans, causing yearly seasonal outbreaks. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) to jump to humans within less than 20 years suggests that novel zoonotic coronavirus spillovers are likely to occur in the future. Despite this, limited information is available on coronavirus pathogenesis and transmission. This is in part due to the lack of in vitro cell models that accurately model host tissues. Very recently, it was already shown that human iPS cells differentiated towards a kidney fate support replication of SARS-CoV-2 (13). Our data imply that human organoids represent faithful experimental models to study the biology of coronaviruses.

All patients were males that were operated for resection of an intestinal tumor. A sample from non-transformed, normal mucosa was taken for this study. The study was approved by the UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands) ethical committee and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch law. This study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants. Human small intestinal cells were isolated, processed and cultured as described previously (23, 25) . Instead of Wnt conditioned media, the medium was supplemented with Wnt surrogate (0,15 nM, U-Protein Express). This was termed expansion (EXP) medium. For differentiation towards EECs, organoids were treated with 1 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) in 'ENR' medium (Beumer et al., in press). General differentiation (termed DIF) was achieved in 'ENR'. BMP activation was achieved by withdrawing Noggin from 'ENR' and addition of BMP-2 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) and BMP-4 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) (termed DIF+BMP).
Human airway organoid culture and differentiation Adult human lung stem cells were derived from non-tumour lung tissue obtained from patients undergoing lung resection. Lung tissue was obtained from residual, tumor-free, material obtained at lung resection surgery for lung cancer. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam granted permission for this study (METC 2012-512). Isolation of human bronchial airway stem cells was performed using a protocol adapted from Sachs and colleagues (2019). Bronchial tissues of adult lungs were cut into ~4mm sections, washed in Advanced DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher), HEPES, penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) (AdDF+++), and incubated with dispase (Corning) mixed with airway organoid (AO) medium (34) at a 1:1 ratio for 1 hour at 37°C. The digested tissue suspension was sequentially sheared using 10-and 5-ml plastic and flamed glass Pasteur pipettes. After shearing and filtering, lung cell pellets were then resuspended in 200 μL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) and plated in ~30 μL droplets in a 48 well tissue culture plate. Plates were placed at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2 for 20 min to solidify the Matrigel droplets upon which 250uL of media was added to each well. Plates were incubated under standard tissue culture c To obtain differentiated organoid-derived cultures, organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE express. Cells were seeded on Transwell membranes (Corning) coated with rat tail collagen type I (Fisher Scientific). Single cells were seeded in AO growth medium: complete base medium (CBM; Stemcell Pneumacult-ALI) at a 1:1 ratio. After 2-4 days, confluent monolayers were cultured at air-liquid interphase in CBM. Medium was changed every 5 days.
After 4 weeks of differentiation, cultures were used for infection experiments.
Organoids were harvested in cold AdDF+++, washed once to remove BME, and sheared using a flamed Pasteur pipette in AdDF+++ or TrypLE express, for undifferentiated and differentiated organoids, respectively. After shearing, organoids were washed once in AdDF+++ before infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in expansion or differentiation medium. After 2 hours of virus adsorption at 37°C 5% CO2, cultures were washed twice with excess AdDF+++ to remove unbound virus. Organoids were re-embedded into 30 μL BME in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured in 500 μL expansion or differentiation medium at 37°C with 5% CO2. Each well contained ~100,000 cells per well. Samples were taken at indicated timepoints by harvesting the medium in the well (supernantant) and the cells by resuspending the BME droplet containing organoids into 500 μL AdDF+++. Samples were stored at -80°C, a process which lysed the organoids, releasing their contents into the medium. Immunostaining of hSIOs Organoids were stained as described before (25 . Organoids were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa488-, 568-and 647-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer containing 4ʹ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; 1;1,000, Invitrogen) and Phalloidin-Alexa488 (Thermofisher). Sections were embedded in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and imaged using a Sp8 confocal microscope (Leica). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software.
Quantitative PCR Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using biological and technical duplicates as described before (36) . Primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool, tested using a standard curve, and include: ACE2_fw CGAAGCCGAAGACCTGTTCTA ACE2_rev GGGCAAGTGTGGACTGTTCC GAPDH_fw GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT GAPDH_rev GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG For qPCR analysis of IFNB1, IFNL1 and ISG15 we used RNA extracted from lysed organoids as described above. We used the following ThermoFisher TaqMan primer-probe mixes: IFNB1: Hs00277188-s1 IFNL1: Hs00601677-g1 ISG15: Hs01921425-s1 Beta actin was amplified using the following primer set: Bact_fw GGCATCCACGAAACTACCTT, Bact_rev AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG Bact_probe FAM-ATCATGAAGTGTGACGTGGACATCCG-BHQ1.
Bulk RNA sequencing Library preparation was performed at Single Cell Discoveries (Utrecht, The Netherlands), using an adapted version of the CEL-seq protocol. In brief: Total RNA was extracted using the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol and used for library preparation and sequencing. mRNA was processed as described previously, following an adapted version of the single-cell mRNA seq protocol of CEL-Seq (37, 38) . In brief, samples were barcoded with CEL-seq primers during a reverse transcription and pooled after second strand synthesis. The resulting cDNA was amplified with an overnight In vitro transcription reaction. From this amplified RNA, sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina Truseq small RNA primers. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nextseq500 platform using barcoded 1 x 75 nt read setup. Read 1 was used to identify the Illumina library index and CEL-Seq sample barcode. Read 2 was aligned to the CRCh38 human RefSeq transcriptome, with the addition of SARS-CoV1 (HKU-39849) and SARS-CoV-2 (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) genomes, using BWA using standard settings (39) . Reads that mapped equally well to multiple locations were discarded. Mapping and generation of count tables was done using the MapAndGo script. Samples were normalized using RPM normalization. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (40). SARSmapping reads were removed before analyzing the different datasets. After filtering for an adjusted p-value < 0.05, the row z-score for the 25 genes with the highest upregulation after 60 hours of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was calculated. Data will be deposited in GEO.
The 50 genes which were most strongly induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 (padj < 0.05, ranked by fold change) were subjected to functional enrichment analysis for a biological process using ToppFun on the ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp) as described before (41). The 5 biological processes with highest enrichment (after FDR correction and a pvalue cutoff of 0.05) for each virus are displayed with the corresponding GO term and corrected p value.
Transmission electron microscopy Organoids were chemically fixed for 3 hours at room temperature with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.067 M cacodylate buffered to pH 7.4 and 1 % sucrose. Samples were washed once with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4), 1 % sucrose and 3x with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4), followed by incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 hour at 4 ᵒC. After rinsing with MQ, organoids were dehydrated at RT in a graded ethanol series (70, 90, up to 100%) and embedded in epon. Epon was polymerized for 48h at 60 ᵒC. 60nm Ultrathin sections were cut using a diamond knife (Diatome) on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome, and transferred onto 50 Mesh copper grids covered with a formvar and carbon film. Sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All TEM data were collected autonomously as virtual nanoscopy slides (26) on FEI Tecnai T12 microscopes at 120kV using an Eagle camera. Data were stitched, uploaded, shared and annotated using Omero (42) and PathViewer. Data was deposited to the Image Data Resource (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession number idr0083."
Multiplex cytokine ELISA Organoid supernatant samples, stored at -80ᵒC, were thawed and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min. The Anti-virus response panel multiplex ELISA kit (BioLegend) was used to determine cytokine concentrations in the samples using a FACSLyric (BD biosciences) flow cytometer. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition that capture beads were inactivated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and washed once in wash buffer after completion of the staining protocol in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with the GraphPad Prism 8 software. We compared differences in cytokine levels and log10 transformed viral titers by a two-way ANOVA followed by a Sidak multiple-comparison test.
