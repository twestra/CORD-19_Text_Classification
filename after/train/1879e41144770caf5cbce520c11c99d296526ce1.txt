In recent years nidoviruses have emerged as an important respiratory pathogen of reptiles, 29 affecting especially captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an 30 inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and 31 often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions 32 in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 33 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain.

The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with 35 previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation 36 of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. 37 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein 38 demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and 39 alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular 40 monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we 41 obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of 42 viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or 43 systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python 44 nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection 45 could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a 46 consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. 47 48 author/funder.

Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and 51 can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from 52 previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the 53 entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a 54 variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise 55 important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently 56 emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned 57 human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal 58 tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better 59 understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.

INTRODUCTION 63 respiratory epithelium. These findings and the fact that nidovirus infections affect several python 88 species led us to the hypothesis that python nidoviruses are not restricted to a certain species and 89 have a broad disease potential. Therefore, we undertook a larger study, making use of diagnostic (Table 1 ) as described (6). 168 Library preparation, data analysis, and genome assembly was done as described (6). 169 To study the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within samples, the NGS 170 reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic and the reads with Q-score over 30 were 171 assembled against the consensus sequence of a given sample using the BWA-MEM algorithm 172 (15) followed by removal of potential PCR duplicates using SAMTools version 1.8 (16).

Gross presentation of nidovirus-associated disease in pythons. 197 Full post mortem examinations were performed on all cases. Most snakes that had died 198 spontaneously exhibited the typical, previously described respiratory changes, represented by a 199 varying amount of mucoid material in the airways and particularly in the lungs (Fig. 1A) . In 200 some animals, the oral cavity, the trachea, the lung and the air sacs were filled with mucoid 201 material and the lung parenchyma appeared thickened (nidovirus-associated proliferative 202 disease; Fig.1A) ; also, the mucoid material was occasionally mixed with purulent exudate. Two 203 euthanized carpet pythons with clinically reported respiratory distress (CH-B1 and -B2, Table 1) 204 did not exhibit any gross pulmonary changes, but showed mild mucus accumulation in the oral 205 cavity. In others, granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotic lesions were observed in the oral, Table 1 . Oral cavity and respiratory tract. The respiratory tract was found to be affected in all animals and degenerated oral and nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D ). In two euthanized carpet pythons (CH-221 B1 and -B2, Table 1 ), these were the only pathological changes, suggesting that they represented 222 early (initial) lesions. The latter is further supported by the fact that in one of the two individuals disease. In all snakes with the above-described intestinal changes (CH-A7 and -A8, CH-B6, CH-244 F1), the mucosal lesions were found to overlie focal inflammatory processes in the intestinal 245 author/funder.

These were represented by multifocal (pyo)granulomatous perivascular infiltrates of 246 macrophages and fewer heterophils and lymphocytes which were predominantly seen in the 247 submucosa in close proximity to the gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) but occasionally 248 extended into the tunica muscularis (Fig. 2C, E) . These lesions contained abundant nidovirus NP The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640 doi: bioRxiv preprint to the inflammatory foci (e.g. pancreatic ducts, renal tubules etc.) without any evidence of (Fig. 3D ). In two cases (CH-B6 and -F1) ependymal cells were also 283 found to be infected, without evidence of correlating brain lesions (Fig 5D) . Table 1 ) and three positive liver specimens (CH-A7, -A8 and CH-B6, viruses had less than 5 % nucleotide and less than 2.4 % amino acid differences with recently 299 described Morelia viridis nidovirus isolates BH128 14-12 and BH171 14-7 and Serpentovirinae 300 sp isolates L3, L4 and H0-1, but more than 13 % nucleotide and 8.5 % amino acid differences to 301 all other nidovirus strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORF1b suggested that these virus 302 forms a sister clade to the previously known python-associated nidovirus species; BPNV and 303 MVNV (Fig 6) . CDSs of the same virus species were obtained from 11 cell culture supernatants, 304 including the isolation attempts from the liver samples included in the NGS analysis. One of the 305 cell culture supernatants analyzed by NGS yielded CDS of MVNV (animal E-C1, Table 1 ), and 306 for four cell culture supernatants NGS failed due to severe bacterial contamination.
For three snakes (CH-A7-8, CH-C3, Table 1 ) the analysis included cell culture isolated virus 308 (lung homogenate as inoculum) and virus sequenced directly from tissue (liver). The consensus 309 sequences obtained from liver tissue and the respective cell culture isolate were identical for 310 each of these three snakes indicating that isolation did not induce a marked bias in the sequence The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640 doi: bioRxiv preprint
In addition to the above snakes, we studied choanal and/or cloacal swabs from seven additional 369 animals from different collections for the presence of nidovirus RNA by RT-PCR. All of the 370 tested animals were found positive for nidovirus infection (Table 1) Table 1 ), and a necrotzing splenitis (CH-A1 and CH-C4, Table 1 ) and fibrinonecrotic enteritis 380 with intralesional coccoid bacterial colonies (E-B1, Table 1 ). Both conditions are likely a 381 consequence of debilation/dehydration due to chronic pulmonary disease. 382 383 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The present study aimed to further elucidate the characteristics 387 and relevance of python nidoviruses. Particular emphasis was laid on the potential species 388 specificity of and/or susceptibility to the viruses, their phylogeny and geographic divergence as 389 well as viral shedding and transmission, host cell tropism and type of associated disease. 390 Experimental infection has been shown to reproduce the naturally occurring respiratory disease 391 (7), so our study focused on natural cases from different geographic regions, from breeding 392 colonies that often kept several python species, and from colonies that at least partly worked 393 closely together, exchanging animals. In our study, no differences were noted between the python species in the degree and distribution The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640 doi: bioRxiv preprint suggest increased susceptibility of snakes from this genus to nidovirus infection and/or disease, a 409 finding also supported by recent epidemiologic studies (14). In support, the analysis of the viral 410 genomes by NGS did not show differences in the viral genome that would explain the 411 differences in the disease manifestation. One could speculate that each python species has its 412 own nidovirus, and that cross-species transmission of the viruses results in morbidity.
