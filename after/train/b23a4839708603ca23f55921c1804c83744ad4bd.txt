18 The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused huge 19 number of human deaths. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for 20 this virus. The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. However, the structure of 21 COVID-19 virus polymerase is yet unknown. Here, we describe the near-atomic 22 resolution structure of its core polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit 23 and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV 24 with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and suggests the 25 mechanism for activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies revealed reduced activity of 26 the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of COVID-27
virus as compared to that of SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into 28
virus towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts.
In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of pulmonary disease 33 in China (Zhu et al., 2020) , which was later officially named "severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 shows a much higher transmission rate and a lower mortality (Huang et al., 2020; 53 .

However, these mutations did not result in obvious structural changes of the polymerase 121 complex. During the review process of this manuscript, two other research groups also reported 122 the high-resolution structure of SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase complex at atomic resolutions, 
The catalytic domain of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 subunit is arranged following the typical right-139 hand configuration shared by all viral RdRps, which includes seven critical catalytic motifs (A-140 G) (Figure 3 ). Among them, motifs A-F are highly conserved for all viral RdRps, and the motif 141 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The motif C contains 143 the critical 759-SDD-761 catalytic residues which reside in a β-turn loop connecting two 144 adjacent strands. The motif F forms a finger-tip that protrudes into the catalytic chamber and 145 interacts with the finger extension loops and the thumb subdomain ( Figure 3B ). It has been 146 shown that some sNSV polymerases, e.g. influenza virus and bunyavirus polymerases, require 147 the binding of a conserved 5'-RNA hook to activate the activity for RNA synthesis by The nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer binds above the thumb subdomain of RdRp and sandwiches 159 the finger extension loops in between to stabilize its conformation ( Figure 1B ). This interaction 160 is mainly mediated by the nsp7 within the heterodimer while the nsp8 (nsp8.1) contributes few 161 contacts with the nsp12 polymerase subunit ( Figures 1B and 3D ). The other nsp8 (nsp8.2) 162 subunit clamps the top region of the finger subdomain and forms additional interactions with 163 .

The two nsp8 subunits display significantly different 164 conformations with substantial refolding of the N-terminal extension helix region, which 165 mutually preclude the binding at the other molecular context ( Figure 3C ). The importance of 166 both cofactor-binding sites has been validated by previous biochemical studies on polymerase, which revealed their essential roles for stimulating the activity of nsp12 168 polymerase subunit (Subissi et al., 2014) .

Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed 186 a much lower efficiency (~35%) for RNA synthesis as compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart 187 ( Figure 4A ). As all three nsp subunits harbor some residue substitutions between the two 188 viruses, we further conducted cross-combination analysis to evaluate the effects of each subunit 189 on the efficiencies of RNA production. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase 190 subunit, replacement of the nsp7 cofactor subunit with that of SARS-CoV did not result in 191 obvious effect on polymerase activity, whereas the introduction of SARS-CoV nsp8 subunit 192 greatly boosted the activity to ~2.1 times of the homologous combination. Simultaneous 193 replacement of the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors further enhanced the efficiency for RNA synthesis 194 to ~2.2 times of that for the SARS-CoV-2 homologous complex ( Figure 4B ). Consistent with 195 this observation, the combination of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8 subunits with the SARS-CoV 196 nsp12 polymerase subunit compromised its activity as compared to the native cognate cofactors, 197 among which the nsp8 subunit exhibited a more obvious effect than that for nsp7 ( Figure 4C ). 198 These evidences suggested that the variations in nsp8 subunit rendered a significantly negative 199 impact on the polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12. The non-significant effect of nsp7 200 on polymerase activity was quite conceivable as only one residue substitution occurred between 201 the two viruses ( Figure 2B ). In addition, we also compared the polymerase activity of different 202 nsp12 subunits in the same context of nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. Combined with either cofactor sets, 203 the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase showed a lower efficiency (~50%) for RNA synthesis as 204 compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart ( Figure 4D ). This observation demonstrated that the 205 residue substitutions in nsp12 also contributed to the reduction of its polymerase activity, with 206 similar impact to the variations in the nsp8 cofactor. 207 .

Despite that there are amino acid substitutions in all three subunits of the core polymerase 210 complex between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, none of these residues is located at the 211 polymerase active site or the contacting interfaces between adjacent subunits ( Figure 2B) , 212 suggesting these substitutions do not affect the inter-subunit interactions for assembly of the 213 polymerase complex. To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding kinetics between 214 different subunits of the two viruses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Each 215 interaction pair exhibited similar kinetic features for the two viruses, all with sub-micromolar 216 range affinities ( Figure 5A and B). We also tested the cross-binding between subunits of the 217 two viruses, which revealed similar affinities for heterologous pairs as compared to the native 218 homologous interactions ( Figure 5C and D) .

The codon-optimized sequences of nsp7 and nsp8 were synthesized with N-terminal 392 6×histidine tag and inserted into pET-21a vector for expression in E. coli (Synbio Tec, Suzhou, 393 China). For the nsp7L8 fusion protein, the sequence was also codon-optimized for E. Coli 394 expression system and a 6×histidine linker was introduced between the nsp7 and nsp8 subunits 395 (Genewiz Tec, Suzhou, China). Protein production was induced with 1 mM isopropylthio-396 galactoside (IPTG) and incubated for 14-16 hours at 16 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested by 397 centrifugations (12,000 rpm, 10 min), resuspended in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 398 2 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. Cell debris 399 were removed via centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 1h) and filtration with a 0.22 μm cut-off filter. .
