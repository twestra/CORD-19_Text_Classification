Abstract 50 19. The kits are also suitable for epidemiological studies and vaccine validations.
The diagnostic kits based on the RBD antigen outperformed those based on the NP. RBD-specific IgA, 70 IgM, and IgG detection kits showed sensitivities of 98· 6%, 96· 8%, and 96· 8%, and specificities of 98· 1%, 71 92· 3%, and 99· 8%, respectively.

A 127 serological test of virus-induced antibody production has unique advantages in clinical diagnostics, 128 especially for identifying people who acquired immunity against pathogens without noticeable 129 symptoms. 14 When the virus invades host, the body produces large amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) by 130 the immune system and released into blood, among them, IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes. 15 It has been 131 widely believed that IgM is the first antibody to be transiently synthesized in response to the virus 132 invasion. 15 IgG is a major class of immunoglobulins found in the blood, comprising 75% of total serum 133 immunoglobulins and has long-term immunity and immunological memory. 15, 16 Therefore, a 134 combination of IgM and IgG has been used in various serological tests for detecting infection of SARS-
CoV-2 as previously used for SARS and other coronaviruses. 10, 11, 14, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] In contrast, IgA, which is mainly 136 produced in mucosal tissues to hinder virus invasion and replication but also detected in blood (~15% of 137 total immunoglobulins in blood), 22 has not been widely used in serological tests for detecting coronavirus 138 infection. IgA's production kinetics and roles in anti-viral immunity of IgA are even less known.
Currently, only a few published studies reported diagnosis of COVID-19 by using ELISA or "flow 140 immunoassay" for detection of serum IgM and IgG with limited accuracy, 10, 11, 17-20 although SARS-CoV-141 2 specific IgA in serum was also detected in recent papers or a preprint. 12, 23, 24 The kinetics of antibody 142 responses in COVID-19 remains undefined, specifically for IgA production.
In this study, we designed and evaluated a set of sensitive and quantitative kits to measure serum IgA, CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A total 216 168 serum samples were taken from the 87 COVID-19 patients.
Negative controls and potentially interfering non-COVID-19 patient serum samples were collected in 170 order to evaluate the reliability of the kits. This cohort contains 330 sera from obviously healthy people, 171 fifteen sera from once suspected cases (RT-qPCR negative but had typical manifestation of pneumonia) 172 and 138 sera from other patients with different underlying diseases.

The specificity and sensitivity of the antibody kits were calculated according to the following formulas: 
In order to analyze the correlation of serum antibody levels and age with disease severity, we first used 215 the Kruskal Wallis test 26 to test if there is any significant difference of IgA among the three groups (Mild,
Moderate, Severe). Then Dunn's test 27 was used to perform a pair-wise test between each group, and 217 Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 28 was used to adjust p-values. All the above analyses use R software 218 version 3.6.1 29 . A p value less than 0· 05 was judged statistically significant.
Results 221
Highly purified SARS-CoV-2 NP and RBD proteins (supplementary figure 1) were employed to 222 develop a series of serological test kits, to detect the presence of NP-and RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and 223 IgG, respectively (hereinafter referred to as "NP kit" and "RBD kit"). A cohort of 216 sera from 87 224 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was tested with both NP and RBD kits, together with 20 sera from 20 225 non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients as negative controls initially. The NP kits for IgA, IgM, and IgG 226 showed diagnostic sensitivities of 89· 8%, 78· 2%, and 95· 8%, and specificities of 85· 0%, 95· 0%, and 227 100% respectively (supplementary figure 2A-C). However, the RBD kits for detecting IgA, IgM, and 228 IgG showed higher diagnostic sensitivities of 97· 2%, 93· 1%, and 96· 8%, and specificities of 100%, 229 90· 0%, and 100%, respectively (supplementary figure 2D-F). We conclude that the RBD based kits IgG kits, the sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement elevate to 99· 1%, 100%, and 99· 7%, 243 respectively. This is much better than when IgM and IgG were combined. When IgA, IgM, or IgG 244 individual kit was used, we observed a total of 9 (0.61% to 6.67%), 37 (5.54% to 40.0%), and 1 (0 to CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Taken together, our detection systems are highly specific to SARS-CoV-2 252 RBD.
We attempted to analyze the kinetics of all the three isotypes of antibodies when multiple serum were significantly older (median age of 62· 5) than those patients with moderate (median age of 46) and 287 mild symptoms (median age of 30). Remarkably, we found that IgA concentrations in severe cases were 288 significantly higher than mild or moderate cases (figure 3A). IgG levels in moderate and severe COVID-289 19 patients were also higher than mild cases (p < 0· 0001) ( figure 3C ). The observation that serum IgG 290 levels were higher in severe and moderate than mild COVID-19 patients have been previously reported 291 .

We also provided here a novel observation that serum IgA levels correlate with COVID-19 severity 292 (figure 3A), how the levels and roles of different types of antibodies as related to COVID-19 severity 293 remain to be determined.
Discussion 296
Compared to sampling of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, blood extraction is more convenient and 297 reliable. Furthermore, serum antibody test is more convenient, fast and accurate, and with other 298 advantages over the detection of viral RNA. 9, 17 We report here an improved serological kit that can 299 sensitively and quantitatively detect serum levels of IgA as well as IgM and IgG. Together with recent 300 reports by others 9-12, 17-20, 23, 24 , the serological data that we obtained from 216 serum samples of 87 
The nucleocapsid protein (NP) is the most abundant protein in coronaviruses, which was reported to 307 be highly immunogenic and often used as a diagnostic marker for coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV 31 .
The RBD of the spike protein on viral surface is the ligand binding to the major host receptor ACE2; 309 therefore RBD could be a main target for neutralization antibodies. 32, 33 In this study, we explored the 310 possibility of using either NP or RBD as an immobilized antigen in for developing a clinical COVID-19 311 diagnostic kit. Our data (supplementary figure 2) showed RBD-based diagnostic kits were better 312 performed than that of NP in detecting all the three types of antibodies. A few previous studies reported 313 that RBD-based IgM and IgG detection is better than NP once a comparison was made 19, 23 , and the 314 measurement is agreeable with the titers measured by virus neutralization assays 23, 24 . We provided here 315 the evidence that RBD as an immobilized antigen is also better than NP in detection serum IgA from 316 COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of difference between the use of two types of viral antigens 317 remain to be resolved. It could be that the NP as a highly basic protein interacts with acidic residues in 318 complementarity determining region in antibodies is less specific. It could also be due to the fact that the 319 NP antigen is expressed in bacteria as most investigators do, and the RBD protein we used is expressed 320 in a human cell line enabling critical glycosylation and high-affinity binding to antibodies raised in 321 COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, we showed that our serological kits based on SARS-CoV-2 spike 322 protein RBD as an immobilized antigen provide a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting IgA, IgM, 323 and IgG in a quantitative manner.
Our serological kits have overall good performance 326 Our kits have much higher accuracy than RT-qPCR (sensitivity less than 70%) for detecting viral 327 RNA 9-13 , and published immune-assays such as " flow immunoassay" and ELISA in earlier studies 10-12, 328 17-21, 23, 24 . When we combined RBD-specific IgA and IgG kits together, the sensitivity, specificity and 329 overall agreement elevate to 99· 1%, 100%, and 99· 7%, respectively (table 1). In addition, this RBD-330 based detection kit may also help to screen and detect neutralization antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 331 RBD, because this peptide domain is exposed on viral surface and functions as a ligand binding to the 332 host cell surface receptor ACE2.

Although one serum collected at the 4th day after illness onset was diagnosed as positive by our IgM 336 kit (not IgA or IgG kits in this study), the IgM kit overall showed a lower diagnostic specificity of 92· 3% 337 compared to that of IgG and IgA (figure 1). IgM is known to have relatively lower affinity toward 338 antigens compared with that of IgG or IgA. In addition, IgM often causes false positive signals as we 339 also observed (supplemental table 2), due to its pentameric structure 34 . To the contrary, IgA or IgG 340 antibody does not have this problem. Our RBD-specific IgG kit showed high specificity of 99· 8% (figure 341 1) but relatively low sensitivity of 96· 8%. This is expected, because that most (6/7) false negative cases 342 were samples collected at 4-10 days after illness onset when IgG production is likely very low.
Our RBD-based IgA kit showed high sensitivity and specificity of 98· 6% and 98· 1%, except two sera 344 collected at the 4th day after illness onset. All other sera (2 at the 6th day, 3 at the 7th day, 1 at the 8th

However, recent reports also demonstrated that serum IgA is involved in the formation of immune 376 complexes to amplify inflammatory responses. 38 Serum IgA induced proinflammatory cytokine 377 production by macrophages, monocytes and Kupffer cells in non-mucosal tissues including liver, skin 378 and peripheral blood. 39 In this study, we observed that IgA was present in COVID-19 patients' serum, 379 and its levels positively correlated with COVID-19 severity ( figure 3A) . In our cohort, we also observed 380 that IgG levels were associated with worse clinical outcomes (figure 3C), as previously described 10, 21 .
The latter phenomena has been suggestive of possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of 
These observations suggest that gut may be an important place for anti-viral response to coronaviruses, 394 and large amounts of secretory IgA could be detected in these mucosal tissues in addition to that in blood.
Weakness of this study
The current study at the present form has several limitations. We used 216 serum samples from 87 398 confirmed COVID-19 patients in this study, and serum samples were not available every day for each 399 patient. The earliest collected serum is at the 4th day after self-reported illness onset, and the last one 
There were 17 severe and five critical cases, respectively, accounting for 19· 5% and 5· 75% respectively.
There were also few cases of COVID-19 patients whose symptoms remained mild and serum samples 407 were collected during hospitalization. Therefore, this study of the correlation between antibody levels 408 and disease severity needs further verification.
In summary, this study reports a novel sensitive and quantitative serological testing kit of detecting 410 IgA as well as IgM and IgG, for the diagnostics of COVID-19. Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, 411 this kit could sensitively and quantitatively measure levels of IgA in blood and other tissues. The
serological study also provides valuable information for monitoring and understanding of COVID-19.
