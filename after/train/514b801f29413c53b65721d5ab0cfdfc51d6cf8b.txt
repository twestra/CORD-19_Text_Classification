Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to global health. Rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. Scientists are working on estimating or predicting infection trajectory for the COVID-19 confirmed cases, which will be useful for future planning and policymaking to effectively cope with the disease. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19 (on April 13, 2020): information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data to estimate COVID-19 infection trajectories. Due to information borrowing across multiple countries, the proposed growth curve models provide a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. They outperform the existing individual country-based models. Additionally, we use countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify the possible countrylevel risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been numerous research works to better understand the pandemic in different aspects Jia et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qiang Li, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020; Sheng Zhang, 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Some of the recent works from statistics community are as follows. Sheng Zhang (2020) focused on a serial interval (the time between successive cases in a chain of transmissions) and used the gamma distribution to study the transmission on Diamond Princess cruise ship. Peng et al. (2020) proposed the generalized susceptible exposed infectious removed model to predict the inflection point for the growth curve, while Yang et al. (2020) modified the proposed model and considered the public health interventions in predicting the trend of COVID-19 in China. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a differential equation prediction model to identify the influence of public policies on the number of patients. Qiang Li (2020) used a symmetrical function and a long tail asymmetric function to analyze the daily infections and deaths in Hubei and other places in China. Remuzzi and Remuzzi (2020) used an exponential model to study the number of infected patients and patients who need intensive care in Italy. One of the major limitations of these works is that the researches are confined by analyzing data from a single country, thereby neglecting the global nature of the pandemic.
2 One of the major challenges in estimating or predicting an infection trajectory is the heterogeneity of the country populations. It is known that there are four stages of a pandemic: visit economictimes.indiatimes.com/-. The first stage of the pandemic contains data from people with travel history to an already affected country. In stage two, we start to see data from local transmission, people who have brought the virus into the country transmit it to other people. In the third stage, the source of the infection is untraceable. In stage four the spread is practically uncontrollable. In most of the current literature, estimation or prediction of the infection trajectory is based on a single country data where the status of the country falls into one of these four stages.
Hence, such estimation or prediction may fail to capture some crucial changes in the shape of the infection trajectory due to a lack of knowledge about the other stages. This motivates the use of data integration (Huttenhower and Troyanskaya, 2006; Lenzerini, 2002) which combines data from different countries and elicits a solution with a unified view of them. This will be particularly useful in the current context of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Recently, there are serious discussions all over the world to answer the crucial question: "even though the current pandemic takes place globally due to the same virus, why infection trajectories of different countries are so diverse?" For example, as seen from Figure 1 , the US, Italy, and Spain have accumulated infected cases within a short period of time, while China took a much longer time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to different shapes of infection trajectories. It will be interesting to find a common structure in these infection trajectories for multiple countries, and to see how these trajectories are changing around this common structure. Finally, it is significant to identify the major countrywide covariates which make infection trajectories of the countries behave differently in terms of the spread of the disease.
The rapid spread of coronavirus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. Scientists are working on estimating the infection trajectory for future prediction of cases, which will be useful for future planning and policymaking.
We propose a hierarchical model that integrates worldwide data to estimate COVID-19 infection trajectories. Due to information borrowing across multiple countries, the proposed growth curve 3 model will be a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we use countrywide covariates to adjust curve fitting for the infection trajectory. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the modeling scheme, which will identify the possible reasons for diversity among the country-specific infection curves.
There are three major classes of infectious disease prediction models: (i) differential equation models, (ii) time series models, and (iii) the statistical models. The differential equation models describe the dynamic behavior of the disease through differential equations allowing the laws of transmission within the population. The popular models include the SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR models (Hethcote, 2000; Korobeinikov, 2004; Tiberiu Harko, 2014) . These models are based on assumptions related to S (susceptible), E (exposed), I (infected), and R (remove) categories of the population. Time series based prediction models such as ARIMA, Grey Model, Markov Chain models have been used to describe dependence structure over of the disease spread over time (Hu et al., 2006; Reza Yaesoubi, 2011; Rushton et al., 2006; Shen X, 2013; Zhirui He, 2018) . On the other hand, statistical models which follow the laws of epidemiology (Clayton and Hills, 2013; Thompson et al., 2006) are also popular, and can be easily extended in the framework of hierarchical models (multilevel model) to analyze data within a nested hierarchy, eventually harnessing the data integration (Browne et al., 2006; Hill, 1965; Stone and Springer, 1965; Tiao and Tan, 1965) . In this paper, we use Bayesian hierarchical models so that data integration and uncertainty analysis (Malinverno and Briggs, 2004) are possible in a unified way.
Specifically, we use the Gompertz growth curve model (Gompertz, 1825) . The novelties of our method are as follows: we (i) use a flexible hierarchical growth curve model to global COVID-19 data, (ii) integrate information from multiple countries for estimation and prediction purposes, (iii) adjust for country-specific covariates, and (iv) perform covariate selection to identify the important reasons to explain the differences among the country-wise infection trajectories. We demonstrate that our proposed models perform better than the individual country-based modes. 4
The Gompertz growth curve model (Gompertz, 1825) is widely used to describe a growth curve for population studies in situations where growth is not symmetrical about the point of inflection (Anton and Herr, 1988; Seber and Wild, 2003) . Examples include trend of mobile phone uptake, bacterial growth in a confined space, and growth of cancer stem cell tumor (Caravelli et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2002; Sottoriva et al., 2010; Zwietering et al., 1990) . There are variant versions of the curve in the literature (Tjørve and Tjørve, 2017) , and we use the following form in this research
where θ 1 , θ 2 , and θ 3 are real numbers. It is easy to derive that the Gompertz curve (1) has its unique inflation point at θ 3 (Goshu and Koya, 2013) . Figure 3 shows different shapes of the Gompertz growth curve obtained by varying each of the three parameters, θ 1 , θ 2 , and θ 3 , while fixing others. The followings are summary of the role of the the parameters: first, θ 1 represents an asymptote for the curve (1); second, θ 2 is related to a growth rate (slope) at the inflection point θ 3 ; third, θ 3 sets the displacement along the x-axis. 
Shape of Gompertz curve with fixed θ 1 =1 and θ 2 =1 Figure 3 : Change of shape of Gompertz curve with varying each of the curve parameters while fixing other two parameters: varying θ 1 (left); θ 2 (middle); θ 3 (right).
We use the Gompertz growth curve (1) to model the infection trajectory. In this context, each of the curve parameters can be interpreted as follows: θ 1 is the maximum cumulative number of infected cases across the times; θ 2 is the growth rate of the trajectory at the inflection time point;
and θ 3 is the inflection time point of the trajectory. More detailed interpretations will be revisited in Subsection 4.5. 5 4 Results
We investigate the predictive performance of three Bayesian models based on the Gompertz growth curve. We start with the individual country-based model (here we use only the single country data) which has been widely used in the literature (M 1 ). Next, we extend the previous model For evaluation criteria, we calculate the mean squared error (MSE) (Fomby, 2006 ) associated with the extrapolated infection trajectory for each of the 50 countries. Training and the test data are selected as follows: given that y k = (y k,1 , · · · , y k,T ) is an infection trajectory of the k-th country spanning for T days since January 22nd, and d is the chosen test-day, then (i) the trajectory spanning for T − d days since January 22nd, that is, (y k,1 , · · · , y k,T −d ), is selected as the training data, and (ii) the d recent observations, (y k,T −d+1 , · · · , y k,T ), is selected as the test data.
For the two models M 2 and M 3 , the MSE is averaged over the 50 countries, given by
where y k,r is the actual value for the cumulative confirmed cases of the k-th country at the r-th time point, and y * k,r is the forecast value. More concretely, y * k,r is the posterior predictive mean given the information from 50 countries. For the model M 1 , the MSE d is acquired by using the predicted values based on a single country.
We evaluate the MSE d from 20 replicates, for each of the short-term test-days (d = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and long-term test-days (d = 22, 24, 26, 28, 30) , and then report the median of the MSE d 's. The 6 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

From the panel, we see that (1) the predictive performances of two hierarchical models, M 2 and M 3 , are universally better than that of M 1 across the number of test-days; and (2) the gap of MSE d between M 1 and the other two models increases as the number of test days d increases. Based on the outcomes, we conclude that information borrowing has improved the accuracy of the forecasting in terms of MSE. Hence, we present all the results in the consequent subsections based on the model M 3 . A similar result is found in the Clemente problem from (Efron, 2010) where the James-Stein estimator (James and Stein, 1992) better predicts then an individual hitter-based estimator in terms of the total squared prediction error. We categorize the 50 countries into the three levels by estimating the the total number of infected cases (that is, θ 1 of the Gompertz growth curve (1)), for the 50 countries. Grouping criteria are as follows: (1) Level 1 (estimated total number is no more than 10,000 cases); (2) Level 2 (estimated 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To that end, we approximate a time point where an infection trajectory levels off its value, showing a flattening pattern after that time point. The following is the definition of the flat time point which we use in this paper:
Definition 4.1. Given the Gompertz growth curve g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) (1), the flat time point t flat, is defined as the solution of the equation θ 1 − = g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) for some small > 0, given by All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

It is important to emphasize that these estimates are based on 'observations tracked until April 9th'. Certainly, incorporation of new information such as compliance with social distancing or advances in medical and biological sciences for this disease may change the inference.

The model M 3 involves three separated linear regressions whose response, and coefficient vector are given by θ l and its corresponding regression parameters β l , respectively (l = 1, 2, 3). (See the equation (3)) The sparse horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al., 2009 (Carvalho et al., , 2010 is imposed for each of the coefficient vectors which makes the model equipped with covariates analysis.

• In the second column of the Table 1 , the parameter θ 1 represents the total number of infected cases across the times. A larger number of θ 1 implies that a country has (can have) more COVID-19 infected patients. A covariate with plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor associated with an increase (or decrease) of the total infected cases.
• In the third column of the Table 1 , the parameter θ 2 represents the a growth rate of the infection trajectory at the time point t = θ 3 . A larger number of θ 2 implies a faster spread of the virus around the country. A covariate with plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor associated with a rapid (or slow) spread of the virus.
• On the fourth column of the Table 1 , the parameter θ 3 is related to the a time-delaying factor of the infection trajectory. The larger the value of θ 3 the later the trajectory begins to accumulate infected cases, leading to a later onset of the accumulation. A covariate with plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor associated with accelerating (or decelerating) the onset of the accumulation. Now, based on the aforementioned guideline, we shall interpret the Finally, moving to the parameter θ 3 , having larger numbers of doctors and COVID-19 testings conducted are helpful in earlier detection of the infected patients, which leads to an earlier onset 14 All rights reserved.

It is important to emphasize that, while medical and biological sciences are on the front lines of beating back COVID-19, the true victory relies on advance and coalition of almost every academic field. However, information about COVID-19 is limited: there are currently no vaccines or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19 (on April 13, 2020). Although numerous research works are progressed by different academic field, the information about COVID-19 is scattered around different disciplines, which truly requires interdisciplinary research to hold off the spread of the disease.
Proper integration of data from multiple sources is a key to understand the COVID-19 disease, and this can be accomplished by borrowing information. The motivation of using the borrowing information is to make use of the indirect evidence (Efron, 2010) to enhance the predictive performance: for example, to extrapolate the infection trajectory for the US, the information is not only from the US (direct evidence) but also from other countries (indirect evidence) which has been utilized to improve the predictive accuracy of the trajectory for the US. To harness the borrowing information endowed with uncertainty quantification, Bayesian argument is useful, which induces sensible inferences and decisions for the users (Lindley, 1972) .
The results demonstrated the superiority of our approach compared to the existing individual country-based models. Our research outcomes can be thought even more insightful given that we have not employed information about disease-specific covariates. That being said, using more detailed information such as social mixing data, precise hospital records, or patient-specific information will further improve the performance of our model. Moreover, integration of epidemiological models with these statistical models will be our future topic of research.

In this research, we analyze global COVID-19 data {y i , x i } N i=1 , obtained from N = 50 countries.
(Meanings for the vector notations, y i and x i , will be explained shortly later.) These countries are most severely affected by the COVID-19 in terms of the confirmed cases on April 9th, and listed on Table 2 : each country is contained in the table with format "country name (identifier)", and this identifier also indicates a severity rank, where a lower value indicates a severer status. The order of the ranks thus coincides with the order of the countries named on the y-axis of the Figure 2 . (3), France (4), Germany (5), China (6), Iran (7), United Kingdom (8) (50) NOTE: Countries are listed with the form "country name (identifier)". This identifier also represents a severity rank. The rank is measured based on the accumulated number of the confirmed cases on April 9th.
For each country i (i = 1, · · · , N ), let y it denotes the number of accumulated confirmed cases for COVID-19 at the t-th time point (t = 1, · · · , T ). Here, the time indices t = 1 and t = T correspond to the initial and end time points, January 22nd and April 9th, respectively, spanning for T = 79 (days). The time series data y i = (y i1 , · · · , y it , · · · , y iT ) is referred to as an infection trajectory For each country i, we collected 74 covariates, denoted by x i = (x i1 , · · · , x ij , · · · , x ip ) (p = 74).
The 74 predictors can be further grouped by 6 categories: the 1st category: general country and 16 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The data sources are the World Bank Data (https://data.worldbank.org/-), World
Health Organization Data (https://apps.who.int/-), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (https://www.noaa.gov/-). Detailed explanations for the covariates are described in SI Appendix.
We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model based on the Gompertz curve (1), which is referred to as Bayesian hierarchical Gompertz model (BHGM), to accommodate the COVID-19 data
(Although the model is based on the Gompertz curve, the idea can be generalized to any choice for growth curves.) Ultimately, a principal goal of the BHGM is to establish two functionalities:
(a) [Extrapolation] uncover a hidden pattern from the infection trajectory for each country i, that is, y i = (y i1 , · · · , y iT ) , through the Gompertz growth curve g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) (1), and then extrapolate the curve.
(b) [Covariates analysis] identify important predictors among the p predictors x = (x 1 , · · · , x p ) that largely affect on the shape the curve g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) in terms of the three curve parameters.
A hierarchical formulation of the BHGM is given as follows. First, we introduce an additive independently identical Gaussian error to each observation {y it } N,T i=1,t=1 , leading to a likelihood part:
where g(t; θ 1i , θ 2i , θ 3i ) is the Gompertz growth curve (1) which describes a growth pattern of infection trajectory for the i-th country. Because each of the curve parameters has its own interpretations in characterizing the infection trajectory, we construct three separate linear regressions:
θ li = α l + x i β l + ε li , ε li ∼ N (0, σ 2 l ), (i = 1, · · · , N, l = 1, 2, 3),

To impose a continuous shrinkage effect (Bhadra et al., 2019) on each of the coefficient vectors, we adopt to use the horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al., 2009 (Carvalho et al., , 2010 :
β lj |λ lj , τ lj , σ 2 l ∼ N (0, σ 2 l τ 2 l λ 2 lj ), λ lj , τ lj ∼ C + (0, 1), (l = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, · · · , p).
Finally, improper priors (Gelman et al., 2004) are used for the intercept terms and error variances terms in the model:
See SI Appendix for a posterior computation for the BHGM (2) -(5).
6.3 Technical expressions for three models M 1 , M 2 , and M 3
Technical expressions for the three models, M 1 , M 2 , and M 3 , compared in Subsection 4.1 are given as follows:
M 1 is an individual country-based model (nonhierarchical model) that uses infection trajectory for a single country y = (y 1 , · · · , y T ) . The model is given by y t = g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) + t , t ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), θ l ∼ N (α l , σ 2 l ), (t = 1, · · · , T, l = 1, 2, 3), where g(t; θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) is the Gompertz growth curve (1), and improper priors (Gelman et al., 2004) are used for error variances and intercept terms as (5).
M 2 is a Bayesian hierarchical model without using covariates, which uses infection trajectories
. This model is equivalent to BHGM (2) -(5) with removed covariates terms in (3).
M 3 is the BHGM (2) -(5).

(47) Scores that show whether general obligations at point of entry are fulfilled (including for coordination and communication) to prevent the spread of diseases through international traffic in 2018. Chemical Events (48) Scores that show whether mechanisms are established and functioning for detection, alert and response to chemical emergencies that may constitute a public health event of international concern in 2018. Radiation Emergencies (49) Scores that show whether mechanisms are established and functioning for detecting and responding to radiological and nuclear emergencies that may constitute a public health event of international concern in 2018.
NOTE 1: The International health regulations, or IHR (2005), represent an agreement between 196 countries including all WHO Member States to work together for global health security. Through IHR, countries have agreed to build their capacities to detect, assess and report public health events. WHO plays the coordinating role in IHR and, together with its partners, helps countries to build capacities. (https://www.who.int/ihr/about/-) NOTE 2: IHR monitoring framework was developed, which represents a consensus among technical experts from WHO Member States, technical institutions, partners and WHO.

respectively, where T -dimensional vector g(θ i1 , θ i2 , θ i3 ) (i = 1, · · · , N ) is obtained by g(θ i1 , θ i2 , θ i3 ) = (g(1; θ 1i , θ 2i , θ 3i ), . . . , g(T ; θ 1i , θ 2i , θ 3i )) .
Here, · 2 indicates the l 2 -norm. Note that the two conditional densities are not known in closed forms because two parameters, θ 2i and θ 3i , participate to the function g(θ 1i , θ 2i , θ 3i ) in nonlinear way. We use the Metropolis algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2003) with Gaussian proposal densities within this Gibbs sampler algorithm.
Step 3. Sample σ 2 from its full conditional distribution
Step 4. Sample α l , l = 1, 2, 3, independently from their full conditional distributions π(α l |−) ∼ N 1 (1 (θ l − Xβ l )/N, σ 2 l /N ).
Step 5. Sample β l , l = 1, 2, 3, independently from conditionally independent posteriors π(β l |−) ∼ N p (Σ β l X (θ l − 1α l ), σ 2 l Σ β l ),
where Σ β l = [X X + Λ −1 * l ] −1 ∈ R p×p , Λ l = diag(λ 2 l1 , · · · , λ 2 lp ) ∈ R p×p , and Λ * l = τ 2 Λ l .
Step 6. Sample λ lj , l = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, · · · , p, independently from conditionally independent posteriors π(λ lj |−) ∼ N (β lj |0, σ 2 l τ 2 l λ 2 lj ) · {1/(1 + λ 2 lj )}.
Note that the densities π(λ lj |−) (l = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, · · · , p) are not expressed in closed forms:
we use the slice sampler (Neal, 2003) .
