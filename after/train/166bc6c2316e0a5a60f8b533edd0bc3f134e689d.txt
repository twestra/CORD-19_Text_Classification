1 Importance: Our study helps fill the knowledge gap related to work-related 2 transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic. 3 Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus 4 disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. 5
Introduction workers (HCWs). Work-related transmission among HCWs constituted a large 23 proportion in previous coronavirus outbreaks. HCWs comprised 37-63% of 24 suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in highly affected 25 .

Study population selection 16 We extracted and included all locally transmitted Covid-19 confirmed cases 17 from the publicized government investigation reports from six Asian 18 countries/areas, including Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, 19 and Vietnam. These countries/areas were selected since they shared some 20 common temporo-spatial characteristics. First, they are proximal to Mainland 21 China, where the first outbreak of Covid-19 was reported. Second, the first 22 cases of these countries/areas were imported cases from Mainland China in 23 mid-January. Third, the first locally transmitted cases in these countries/areas 24 were identified around late January to early February. We followed each 25 .

We also conducted sensitivity analysis comparing the results between the six 21 countries/areas and five countries/areas excluding Japan. We excluded Japan 22 due to its different case reporting system from other countries/areas. Unlike 23 other countries/areas that have central reporting systems, Japan had cases 24 reported from each prefecture separately. Differences in reporting 25 .

The descriptive analysis was performed by R software (version 2 3.6.2). The figures were plotted by Microsoft® EXCEL™. and so on. In terms of occupation grouping, the groups with the most cases 20 were HCWs, drivers and transport workers, services and sales workers, 21 cleaning and domestic workers, and public safety workers.
