Objectives: As of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States and in Europe.
Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database.
We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model.
We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.
Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global emergency situation [1] , for which the development of drugs and vaccines has been intensively investigated worldwide. In April 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [2] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [3] have approved the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for an emergency treatment of COVID-19, based on their potential effectiveness in this setting [4, 5] .
While chloroquine has a long history in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, its safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 remain unknown [5] . In the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, chloroquine can cause numerous side effects such as nausea, headache, pruritus, worsening of psoriasis, retinopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. While neuropsychiatric symptoms such as seizure, coma, and psychosis, were also reported in patients who received chloroquine [6, 7] , it is still unknown which neuropsychiatric symptoms are directly associated with the use of chloroquine, partly because of their relatively low frequency [8] . Understanding in advance the types of neuropsychiatric symptoms that may occur in patients treated with chloroquine, may be useful, particularly in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units, where rapid clinical judgement is required.
In the current study, we investigated the link between the use of chloroquine and the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database that is provided by the FDA [9] .

This was a retrospective pharmacovigilance study that used the FAERS database. This database contains more than 9 million global case reports of potential adverse events of drugs. On April 1, 2020, we downloaded from the FDA's website (https://www.fda.gov) patient data that were reported between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. The FAERS database contains data tables named 'DEMO', 'DRUG', 'REAC', 'OUTC', 'RPSR', 'THER', and 'INDI', of which we mainly used the following 3 tables: 1) 'DEMO', which provides the case ID, sex, age, year of event occurrence, country of event occurrence, and the reporter's type of occupation (e.g., medical doctor, pharmacist, lawyer, consumer); 2) 'REAC', which contains all adverse events that are potentially caused by the drug used by each patient, and 3) 'DRUG', which includes the name, dose, indication, and date of administration and discontinuation of each drug that is possibly associated with that AE. In the 'DRUG' table, the causality assessment of the relationship between each drug and its reported AE is classified by the reporter as 'primary suspected', 'secondary suspected', 'concomitant', or 'interacting'. In our analysis, we included only reports that were classified as 'primary suspected' and 'secondary suspected', to reduce the risk of false positive association in deriving our conclusions. In addition, we included only reports that were reported from medical doctor, pharmacist, or other medical staffs, and not from lawyers or consumers.

In the FAERS database, the AEs are mainly identified by their Preferred Terms (PTs), as determined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). To search for cases that were associated with chloroquine (including hydroxychloroquine) or mefloquine treatment and presented with any of the AEs of interest, we used the following neurological or psychiatric AE terms, as summarized in Supplemental Table 1 We included mefloquine as one of our drugs of interest because it is an antimalarial drug that is known to cause neuropsychiatric AEs [12] . We classified each case report based on the following binomial factors: 'with' or 'without' exposure to the drugs of interest, and 'with' or 'without' the development of each of the AEs of interest, irrespective of the timing of drug administration or the time of AE development.
All data handling and statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.1). For each included drug (chloroquine or mefloquine), we calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR), to assess the potential drug-AE links for chloroquine (or mefloquine) and the reported neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The crude ROR was calculated by a 2 Ã— 2 contingency table as described previously [13] [14] [15] , where all the reports were classified by two factors for each AE term and for each drug, as described above. When the lower limit of the 95% confidential interval (CI) for the adjusted ROR was > 1, the AE was considered to be significantly highly reported following the use of the drug of interest, compared with the report of the same AE following the use of all other drugs.
In calculating ROR, we used a multilevel model, to adjust for covariates in a hierarchical design, (1)]. An informed consent was not required for this type of study. The work was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid out in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964.

In total, our analysis included 2,389,474 unique case reports. There were 4,336 case reports with exposure to chloroquine, of which 520 ( (lower limit of the 95% CI > 1). As for mefloquine ( Figure 1B) , all of the neuropsychiatric AEs, except for somnolence, showed high reporting, with adjusted ROR values higher that 2 in almost all cases.

In this study, we investigated reports of neuropsychiatric AEs that were developed following exposure to chloroquine as a treatment for malaria or autoimmune diseases. The major strength of our study is that it was based on a database that includes global real-world data from a very large number of patients. Our results showed a statistically significant association (albeit marginal) between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of LOC, amnesia, delirium, hallucination, and depression, however, there was no statistically significant association between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of suicide, psychosis, confusion, or agitation, suggesting that there is no link between the use of chloroquine and the increased risk of these AEs. Conversely, mefloquine showed to be associated with statistically significant high reporting of most of the neuropsychiatric AEs, which is consistent with some of the earlier literature reports [12, 19] .
Our study has some limitations, resulting from the use of self-reported data [11] , and it therefore includes some bias that cannot be eliminated. First, this setting may be associated with a reporting bias, that is, over-or under-reporting of neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine.
Second, due to the absence of denominators, we were not able to discuss the incidence rate of each neuropsychiatric AE. Third, in our multivariate adjustment, we did not consider the use of concomitant medications or the medical history of the patients, both of which could have potentially contributed to the development or to the worsening of some neuropsychiatric symptoms. Fourth, while suicide was . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Fifth, we
have not included the timing or the total dose of chloroquine and mefloquine in the analysis. Lastly, it is possible that our final dataset included duplicated cases that should have been excluded.
To conclude, the current pharmacovigilance study, using the FAERS database, did not suggest a potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide or psychosis. These results provide information that can be essential when the use of chloroquine is considered for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Since this study was based on a self-reporting database that inevitably contains several biases, cohort studies are needed, to validate these results and to confirm the neuropsychiatric safety of chloroquine.
