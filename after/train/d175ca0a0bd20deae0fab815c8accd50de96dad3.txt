In the present study, we have screened 38 and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes from the eleven Protein 39 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened 40 epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele 41 binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by 42 molecular docking. The shortlisted screened epitopes were further utilized to 43 design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B 44 cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune 45 response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our 46 vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-47 associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N 48 terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were 49 prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like 50 Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further 51 analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line. The 52 present study is very significant in terms of molecular designing of prospective 53 CTL and HTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the potential to elicit 54 cellular as well as humoral immune response. 55 56
The novel coronavirus (COVID19), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus ORF10 protein has location 29,558-29,674 aa and 192 length 38 aa (NCBI protein sequence database). utilized to screen the potential CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes. The screened 215 epitopes were further studied for overlapping consensus regions amongst them. 216
The epitopes showing overlapping regions in partial or complete were chosen for 217 detailed further studies. 218 10 The chosen CTL and HTL epitopes were analyzed for their molecular 219 interaction with their respective HLA allele binders. Moreover, the chosen CTL 220 epitopes were also analyzed for their molecular interaction with TAP (Transporter 221 associated with antigen processing) transporter cavity to observe their smooth 222 nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Bui et al., 2006) . T cells recognize the complex 305 between a specific major MHC molecule and a particular pathogen-derived 306 epitope. The given epitope will elicit a response only in an individual that express 307 an MHC molecule, which is capable of binding that particular epitope. This 308 denominated MHC restriction of T cell responses and the MHC polymorphism 309 provides the basis for population coverage study. The MHC types are expressed 310 author/funder.

Hence a vaccine with 311 larger population coverage could be of greater importance (Sturniolo et al., 312 1999) . Clinical administration of multiple-epitopes involving both the CTL and the 313 HTL epitopes are predicted here to have a greater probability of larger human 314 population coverage worldwide. 315
Sequence-based B Cell epitope prediction. Protein sequence-based method 318 "Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction" was utilized to screen linear B cell epitopes 319 from eleven different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The tool "B Cell Epitope Prediction 320
Tools" of IEDB server (http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/) was utilized. In this screening, 321 the parameters such as hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed 322 surface, polarity and the antigenic propensity of the polypeptides is correlated 323 with its location in the protein. This allows the search for continuous epitopes 324 prediction from protein sequence. The prediction is base on the propensity scales 325 for each of the 20 amino acids. For a window size n, the i -(n-1)/2 neighboring 326 residues on each side of residue i are used to compute the score for the residue 327 i. The method "Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction" utilized here is based on the 328 propensity scale method as well as the physiochemical properties of the given 329 antigenic sequence to screen potential epitopes (Larsen et al., 2006) . 330 331

The screening of helper T 626 lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes from eleven different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was 627 performed based on "Percentile rank". The smaller the value of percentile rank 628 the higher would be the affinity of the peptide with its respective HLA allele 629 binders. The 33 epitopes with high percentile ranking were shortlisted ( Omega. The analysis has shown that several epitopes of CTL, HTL and B cell 728 were having amino acid sequences overlap.
