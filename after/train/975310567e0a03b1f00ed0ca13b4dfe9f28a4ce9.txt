The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread.
Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3-stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID-19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county.
Results: Using data from March 14-31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%.
We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for
The continued spread of confirmed cases of COVID-19, absence of a vaccine, limited resources for testing and assisting people with confirmed cases have presented a great challenge for our public health and healthcare provider systems. To this point, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing are the only effective mitigation measures. The rapid spread of the disease means that government and health services have very little time to plan and design effective response policies such as resource and workforce planning. Accurately predicting the near future COVID-19 spread at sufficient granularity would provide these organization with better information and time to appropriately plan and respond.
We have developed a three-stage machine learning model to estimate COVID-19 spread outcomes at the US county level. In the first stage, we estimate the probability that a county has at least one confirmed COVID-19 case. In the second stage, we estimate the number of COVID-19 occurrences given that county has at least one case. Finally, we combine the results from the two stages to estimate those counties that have the greatest and least vulnerability for changes in disease prevalence for the next five-day period.
There has been significant epidemiological work for previous coronavirus pandemics such as MERS and SARS. 1 For example, Badawi et al. 2 performed systematic analysis of prevalence of comorbidities in MERS using data from 12 studies and found that diabetes and hypertension were present in 50% of the cases. Matsuyama et al. 3 systematically reviewed studies involving laboratory confirmed MERS cases to measure both the risk of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and death. They compared risks by age, gender and underlying comorbidities. Park et al. 4 reviewed characteristics and associated risks factors of MERS. Bauch et al. 5 surveyed SARS modeling literature focused on understanding the basic epidemiology of the disease and evaluating control strategies. Surveyed SARS models varied in the terms of population studied and geographical characteristics. 6, 7 Different designs were used for SARS modeling consisting of deterministic compartmental models 7 , stochastic compartmental models 6 , a combination of stochastic and deterministic compartmental models 8 , discrete-time models 9 , logistics curve fitting models 10 , contact network models 11 and likelihood-based models. 12 Studies associated with risk factors for SARS 13 and MERS 3,14-20 have found an association between comorbidities and infected cases.
MERS and SARS epidemiological modeling has been done at different granularities such as the country 21, 22 , specific region 23 , and case clusters. 6 Given the much broader reach of COVID-19 compared to MERS and SARS, it is very important to predict at a sufficiently high level of granularity. This is particularly important since previous studies have shown that there is considerable heterogeneity in space, transmissibility and susceptibility. 5 Our approach is developed at county level with inclusion of a variety of health statistics, demographics and geographical features of counties. Further, we use publicly available data so that any organization could use the model. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to predict near future infection risk at the county level using the combination of health statistics, demographics and geographical features of counties.

We performed an epidemiological study at the US county level using publicly available data to develop a machine learning predictive model. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2020, to April 3, 2020. The study was reviewed by the Penn State Integrated Research Ethics Board and deemed exempt because it was a deidentified, secondary data analysis. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. 24
We used US Census data to obtain county level population statistics for age, gender and density . 25

Previous studies have shown angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates the infection of COVID-19 [35] [36] [37] , and that patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have an increased expression of ACE2. 35 County population factors such as density, age, and sex have a significant impact on the spread of an epidemic. 38 Cancer and chronic respiratory diseases have also been shown to increase mortality risk for COVID-19. 39 The dataset used for our three-stage model contains correlated variables. For example, diabetes and hypertension prevalence, cancer crude rate and old population. Additionally, the underlying relationship between variables was assumed to be non-linear. For such cases the literature supports 40-47 using gradient tree boosting and deep learning methods for better prediction results.

In order to predict COVID-19 outcomes, we divided the problem into three stages. In the first stage, we formulated a binary classification problem that included both positive and negative instances. We developed an XGBoost 48 classifier model to learn from the data. We divided the dataset into training and testing in 80-20 proportions for each class. We tuned the hyperparameters of the model using the Hyopt package.
In the second stage, we formulated an XGBoost regression model that included data only for positive instances with number of occurrences as the response. As in the case for the first stage, we divided data into training and testing sets in 80-20 proportions and used the Hyopt package for hyperparameter tuning.
In the last stage, we combined results from the first two stages and calculated the expected occurrences for counties as a measure of county vulnerability. For the calculation of expected occurrences, we multiplied the probability of county belonging to the positive instances derived using the classification model, with potential occurrences the same county will have if it becomes a positive instance derived using the regression model.

The variable importance for the overlapping predictors between the final classification and regression models for March 16 th is shown in Figure 1 . Total population (TOT_POP) was the most important variable for both the classification and regression models. Other important variables included population density, longitude, hypertension prevalence, chronic respiratory mortality rate, cancer crude rate, and diabetes prevalence. Latitude (we use this to identify neighboring counties and the presence or absence of positive class in the neighborhood) and percentage of populations older than 70 years were found to be the least important features of those considered, though still played a role. Table 2) is given by percentage of counties that had no confirmed cases but were identified as being among the 5% most vulnerable had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case five days later. The specificity (Table 3) is given by the percentage .

The dataset is comprised of 37% urban and 63% rural counties based on the urban and rural county definition for year 2013. 49 In order to determine if there is an association between urbanicity and vulnerability, we performed a set of one-sided t-tests. The null hypothesis -the 10% least vulnerable counties would have the same proportion of rural counties as the actual proportion of rural counties in the dataset -was rejected for every day from March 14 th to March 26 th . Additionally, the null hypothesis -the actual positive instances counties would the same proportion of urban counties as the actual proportion of urban counties in the dataset -was also rejected for every day over the analysis period. It can therefore be concluded that there is a positive association between urban and most vulnerable counties as well as rural and least vulnerable counties. The continuous decreasing trend in the confidence interval of the urban counties proportion estimate within actual positive instance counties can be used to infer that COVID-19 is propagating from urban counties to rural counties.

We developed a three-stage machine learning model using publicly available data to predict the five-day vulnerability of a US county. The model estimates the likelihood and impact that a county with no documented COVID-19 cases will have within a five-day period and using them, vulnerability prediction for a county is made. Using data from March 14 th to Marth 31 st , 2020, the model showed a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%. We found a positive association between affected counties and urban counties as well as top 10% least vulnerable counties and rural counties. Further, counties with higher population density, a greater percentage of 70 years of above age people, higher diabetes, cardiac illness and respiratory diseases prevalence are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than their counterparts.
Our model serves multiple purposes. First, it can help in identifying potentially vulnerable counties. This prediction would be a vital component in managing COVID-19 spread by providing vulnerability information based on the likelihood and magnitude of change within five days. That can help health organizations to plan effectively for management of hospital resources and workforce, rapid response teams, and COVID testing kits and testing locations.
In addition, there are multiple counties with limited testing facilities, and with current swab-based testing, it takes multiple days to get the results. Thus, occurrences associated with each county fluctuate rapidly daily.
There are multiple limitations to our work. First, there are several predictors that we did not include in the model that have known associations with COVID-19. However, one of our goals was to make sure that any organization could use our model by only including data that is publicly available. Second, our analysis (Table e2) found that there is an increasing trend for the coefficient of variation (CV) for occurrences associated with positive instances counties.

As testing facilities improve in terms of numbers and efficiency, this bias would be minimized and would be reflected in the model.
Given this point, it would useful to look at top riskiest and top safest counties predicted by MJK model and examine for potential data discrepancies. Finally, additional feature engineering and stacking methods can be utilized to enhance the prediction capabilities of existing models.
