The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses a serious public health 33 risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-34 CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral 35 evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for 36 viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal 37 for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high 38 performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment 39 VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic 40 and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation 41 of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library 42 construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes 43 with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on 44 pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully 45 obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-46 CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA 47 is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened 48 hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, 49 versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations 50 during outbreaks, both current and future.
period from January to March 2020, presenting different symptom severity ( Fig. 2A and   153 Fig. S3). Some patients were re-sampled longitudinally to investigate temporal and intra-154 host viral heterogeneity. We also used these samples to benchmark MINERVA against 155 conventional dsDL strategies. Samples Y1-Y6 were excluded from dsDL processing as 156 this processing strategy is incompatible with samples containing carrier RNA. On average, 157 we sequenced 1-3 Gbp for each MINERVA library pre-and post-enrichment, and nearly 158 100 Gbp for each dsDL library (Fig. 2B) .
The metagenomic composition of SHERRY and dsDL libraries were comparable: total 161 virus, fungus and bacteria ratios were highly concordant between the two methods (Fig. 162 S4); bacterial heterogeneity revealed by entropy is also correlated between the two 163 strategies. In both MINERVA and dsDL data, we detected low yet significant levels of 164 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The viral ratio is between 10 -7 and 10 -1 . It is worth noting that 165 the SARS-CoV-2 sequence ratio is higher in MINERVA data than in dsDL data (Fig. 2C 166 and 2D), suggesting that MINERVA libraries capture more SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This 167 phenomenon was more prominent for low viral load samples. Though SARS-CoV-2 168 genome coverage and depth was not high in SHERRY results due to low viral ratio and 169 low sequencing depth, performing MINERVA subsequently can enrich the SARS-CoV-2 170 sequence ratio up to 10,000-fold ( Fig. 2E and S5) . As a result, MINERVA gives more 171 complete and deeper coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Fig. 2F and 2G) , despite 172 sequencing dsDL libraries to two orders of magnitude more depth (Fig. 2B) . We achieved 173 even higher quality of MINERVA data by scaling up the reaction volume (Fig. S5) . Using 174 the same samples and the same amount of sequencing data, more input in a higher 175 reaction volume resulted in deeper SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. 176 177 .

Both dsDL and MINERVA libraries detect SARS-CoV-2 sequences for 179 samples with various Ct values, but MINERVA produced more complete and deeper 180 genome coverage than dsDL methods ( Fig. 2H and 2I) , and this advantage is more 181 pronounced for low viral load samples, including two samples with negative qPCR results.
Carrier RNA, which is widely used in viral DNA/RNA extraction before RT-qPCR assays, 184 severely impacts high-throughput sequencing analysis. Therefore, most RT-qPCR showed the biggest improvement over dsDL for stool samples (Fig. 2H) , which prompted 194 us to investigate these samples further. By assessing the relative compositions of 195 bacterial species and viral species in each sample type, we noted that the bacteria largely 196 account for the difference between stool samples and the other two samples types, not 197 viruses ( Fig. 3A and S6 ). This is likely due to the unique relationship between the 198 microbiome and its environment, subject to host-specific variations. In the stool samples, (Fig. 3B) . Stool samples contained more Bacteroides, whereas the pharyngeal and 208 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

There also appears to be 209 separation between samples by COVID-19 symptom severity along PC2 (Fig. 3B) ; 210 specifically, we found samples from severe and critical condition patients to be abundant 211 in Comamonas rather than Streptococcus, which is abundant in mild and severe condition 212 samples (Fig. 3C) .
