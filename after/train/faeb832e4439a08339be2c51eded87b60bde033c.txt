An ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between air pollution, and COVID-19 cases and fatality rates in London. The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R 2 >0.7) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of COVID-19 transmission within London boroughs. Particularly, strong correlations (R 2 >0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 15 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations were also found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the city's vulnerable regions. Such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city. The methodology and learnings from the study can thus aid in public 20 transport's response to COVID-19 outbreak by adopting different levels of human-mobility reduction strategies based on the vulnerability of a given region.
One Sentence Summary: This study introduces air pollution levels as an indicator for a region's vulnerability to COVID-19 and suggests human-mobility reduction measures.

The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a global pandemic [1] . Reported first within the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019, the COVID-19 exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly across the world [2] . The human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur from 30 individuals in the incubation stage or showing symptoms, and also from asymptomatic individuals who remain contagious [3] . The COVID-19 has been reported to transmit via the inhalation of exhaled respiratory droplets [4] that remain airborne for up to 3 hours [5] . The long-term exposure to air pollution has been reported to increase the risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 outcomes [6] . The extent to which COVID-19 induces respiratory stress in infected individuals may also be 35 influenced by underlying respiratory conditions [7] like acute respiratory inflammation, asthma and cardiorespiratory diseases [8] . The simultaneous exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) alongside COVID-19 virus is expected to exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection and risk of fatality [9, 10] . Moreover, the adsorption of the COVID-19 virus on PM could also contribute to long-range transmission of the virus [4] . For example, the 40 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infected patients who lived in moderate air pollution levels were reported to be 84% more likely to die than those in regions with lower air pollution [11] . The aerosol and surface stability of the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 [5] . 5 Given the limited understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, social-distancing and humanmobility reduction measures can contribute greatly to tailoring public health interventions [12] . Consequently, countries across the world have enforced lockdowns and other coordinated efforts to reduce human-mobility [13, 14, 15, 16] . The UK's national framework for responding to a pandemic states that public transport should continue to operate normally during a pandemic, but 10 users should adopt good hygiene measures, and stagger journeys where possible [17] . Within the UK, London has recorded the highest COVID-19 related fatalities (i.e. 30.2% of UK's deaths as of 31 March 2020) [18] . On 18 March 2020, further to the UK government's advice, Transport for London (TfL) closed 40 out of 270 London Underground (LU) stations that do not serve as interchanges with other lines and announced a reduced service across its network [19] . This is also 15 because 30% of TfL's drivers, station staff, controllers and maintenance teams were not able to come to work, including those self-isolating or ill with COVID-19 [20] . The UK's current humanmobility reduction response reflects the need to maintain business continuity, near normal functioning of society and enable critical workers to make essential journeys [17, 21] . However, a statistically significant association exists between human-mobility through public transport and 20
transmissions of acute respiratory infections (ARI) [21, 22] . It was found that using public transport in the UK during a pandemic outbreak has an approximately six-fold increased risk of contracting an ARI [21] . Moreover, boroughs with access to LU interchange stations have historically higher pandemic case rates [22] , as users are exposed to higher number of individuals in comparison to through stations. The methodology and results from this study can be employed 25 to rapidly identify local authorities/regions that are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 and accordingly inform human-mobility reduction measures across the city's public transport network.
As the COVID-19 is an evolving pandemic, the available data at the time of writing this paper on 31 March 2020 on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for different boroughs in London was 30 collected from [23, 18] . The fatality rate across each London boroughs was estimated by dividing the number of reported deaths by the number of reported positive COVID-19 cases. The average air pollution data associated with NO2 and PM2.5 concentration was collected for London boroughs from [24] . Figure 1 ). In particular, COVID-19 fatality rate increased with increase in short-term air pollution, where a significant correlation 45 between COVID-19 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations with R 2 of 0.90 (fatality rate = 1.864+ 0.5787*NO2 level) and 0.67 (fatality rate = -7.733+ 2.3399*PM2.5 level) were found (see Figure 2 ).
As per TfL's guidance to LU users [25] , 40 LU stations across its network were closed as part of the UK Government's response to COVID-19. The median PM2.5 levels recorded by [26] for 27 of these 40 closed stations range from 0-50 μg m −3 (5 stations), 50-100 μg m −3 (9 stations), 100-200 5 μg m −3 (5 stations), 200-300 μg m −3 (6 stations) and greater than 300 μg m −3 (2 stations) (see Table  S1 ). Of the 230 operating stations, the median PM2. Table S1 ). This suggests that approximately 40% of the stations in operation during the current COVID-19 outbreak in 10
London are up to 26 times more polluted than the ambient background locations and the roadside environment (that have median PM2.5 level of 14 μg m −3 [26] ). Moreover, the average NO2 concentrations within the LU network was reported to be 51 μg m −3 [27] ; which is 27.5% higher than the NO2 limit values for the protection of human health [28] .
Various studies have reported an association between air pollution levels and excess morbidity and mortality from respiratory diseases [29, 30] . Both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with a variety of respiratory conditions [11] with children and elderly people being at most risk [31] . Our analysis shows that short-term exposure to air pollution (both NO2 and PM2.5) is significantly correlated with an increased risk of contracting and dying from 20 COVID-19. It was reported by [6] that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of COVID-19 deaths. Biologically, either long-term or short-term exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2 can compromise lung function and therefore increasing the risk of death from COVID-19 [7] . Also, the median level of airborne PM2.5 in LU during summer is often several times higher than other transport environments such as cycling (35 μg m −3 ), bus 25 (30.9 μg m −3 ), cars (23.7 μg m −3 ) [32, 26] . The greatest PM2.5 concentrations across the LU network was reported to be on the Victoria Line (around 16 times higher than roadside environment), followed by Northern, Bakerloo and Piccadily line [26] . The routine cleaning and maintenance of LU ranges from litter removal to preventing safety incidents rather than on reducing PM concentrations. Our study is in agreement with [22] who reported that there are higher 30 pandemic case rates for London boroughs with access to interchange stations, as individuals would interact with more people in comparison to through stations.
An analysis by [33] of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) records have reported that 20% of England's population are at risk of mortality from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions and age. We support the UK government's existing COVID-19 guidance [34] to exercise good hygiene 35 and to avoid unnecessary travel. While considering the evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted from an asymptomatic individual [3] , we do not support the current countermeasure of suspending LU operations on the stations that do not serve as interchanges. This is because of (i) the statistically significant risk of contracting ARI's on UK's public transport and higher pandemic case rates within London boroughs that have comparatively easier access to interchange stations 40 [21, 22] and, (ii) relatively higher air pollution levels in LU stations than ambient background locations or road side environment. Since isolating towns or even cities is not yet part of the UK government's action plan [34] , we recommend a vulnerability-based assessment of different boroughs in London and to accordingly suspend or reduce operations on LU stations within highly vulnerable regions. For instance, London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is seen to be highly 45 All rights reserved.

Table S1 shows that, all the through stations and 3 out of 4 interchange stations (South Kensington, Sloane square, Earl's court, Notting Hill gate) in this borough are currently operational. Such a vulnerability-based assessment might aid decision-makers in selecting appropriate human-mobility reduction measures to COVID-19 in London's different local authorities/boroughs (such as apportion of transport staff 5 across railway stations, arranging dedicated shuttling services for key workers, scheduling bus operations etc.) while adhering to the UK's national framework for response to pandemic outbreaks [17] .
Given that the immunity to the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 was reported to be relatively short-lived (around 2 years) [35] , achieving herd immunity for such diseases would be unlikely without 10 overwhelming the healthcare system [16] . Moving forward, human-mobility reduction measures provides the greatest benefit to COVID-19 mitigation [15, 14] as prevention is potentially costeffective than cure [22] or death. One of the most controversial debate in pandemic countermeasures is the potential benefit of human-mobility reduction and social-distancing attained by closure of public transport systems [21] . From a public policy perspective, there is a 15 need to achieve a trade-off between the potential public health benefits of closing public transport during a pandemic thereby delaying the community spread, against the socio-economic impacts of curtailing/reducing human mobility. Determining the vulnerability of regions/locations to COVID-19 might be helpful in achieving such trade-offs. To this end, this study demonstrates that the air pollution levels can serve as one of the indicators to assess a region's vulnerability to It has to be noted that the number of positive COVID-19 cases considered within this study are only those reported at the hospitals and does not include the growing number of people who are self-isolating due to COVID-19. While the individual risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 is dependent on various factors (including age, underlying conditions, availability of health care, population density etc.), these results are informative for both scientists and decision-makers 25 in their efforts to reduce the transmission and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak through appropriate human-mobility reduction strategies.
