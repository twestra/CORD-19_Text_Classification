The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OECD countries in the recent time. The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of government health policies on fatality rates (Case fatality rates) of COVID-19 in OECD countries while controlling for other demographic and economic characteristics. The analysis is done using non-parametric regression method, i.e. Quantile regression. The result from quantile regression analysis shows that a policy of Austerity (health expenditure cuts) significantly increases the mortality rates of COVID-19 in OECD countries. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust public-funded health system with wider accessibility to deal with major public health crisis like COVID-19 pandemic.
The contemporary world is facing an unprecedented public health crisis emerging from Covid-19. Covid-19 has spread to 200 countries and infected 877422 people across the world. Out of the total infected people across the globe, nearly 43537 have died, and 185241 have recovered till 1 st April 2020 (CSSE, 2020) . After the outbreak of Covid-19 and declaration of it being a Pandemic by WHO, there has been a massive increase in the volume of research on Covid-19(Heymann&Shindo, 2020; Novel, 2020) . However, most of the research is restricted to clinical perspectives including SARS Cov-2 reproduction rate (Liu et al., 2020) , fatality ratio (Onder et al., 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020) , asymptotic transmission mode (Bai et al., 2020) and other epidemiological characteristics (Atkeson, 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020; Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020; Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Countries across the globe have responded with various measures including rapid testing of population, isolating suspected individuals, imposing strict social distancing norms and totally shut down of economic activities in the form of lockdowns (Ebrahim et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020; Tanne et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020) . The economic impact of Covid-19 for different regions and countries are studied using different economic models and estimation technique (Abiad et al., 2020; Atkeson, 2020; Fernandes, 2020; Hartley & Makridis, 2020; McKibbin & Fernando, 2020; Ruiz Estrada, 2020) .
Review of existing literature on Covid-19 manifests a lacuna with respect to the dynamic interplay between Covid-19 and country-specific health policies. This paper attempts to fill this gap by highlighting the interrelationship between long term structural health policies and the Covid-19 fatality rates among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 2 .Austerity policy is defined as a widespread cut on government expenditure which is targeted to reduce government fiscal deficit and enhance economic growth (Konzelmann, 2014; ) . Such a significant reduction in government spending has a disproportionately negative impact on government social sector expenditure (Health, Education, Social security etc.). The negative impact of austerity policies in terms of lowering employment, economic growth and increasing inequality is well studied (Blyth, 2013; Krugman, 2015; Stiglitz, 2012; UNCTAD, 2017) . In the post-2008 crisis period and under the impact of rising debts burdens, many European countries imposed policies of austerity in 2010. The most severe austerity policies were implemented in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Spain and Portugal (Leschke et al., 2015) . the OECD group, there was variation in the extent of reduction in their health expenditure across countries in pursuit of Austerity policies(fiscal consolidation) (Van Gool& Pearson, 2014 such drastic fund cuts on access to health facilities and health indicators is well documented in many OECD countries (Antonakakis& Collins, 2014; Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2013; Ifanti et al., 2013; Kentikelenis et al., 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Loopstra et al., 2016 Loopstra et al., , 2016 McKee et al., 2012 McKee et al., , 2012 Reeves et al., 2014 Reeves et al., , 2014 Ruckert&Labont√©, 2017; Stuckler et al., 2017) . So under this background of such drastic cuts in health expenditure, this paper will evaluate the impact of austerity policies (health expenditure cuts) on fatality rates of Covid-19 after controlling for other socio-demographic characteristics which have a significant impact on fatality rates of Covid-19.The fatality rates are measured by crude Case Fatality Rates (CFC), which is the ratio of confirmed death to confirmed positive cases of covid-19 for each country.
Data used for analysis is taken from various sources. Table 1 provides the list of variables used in the analysis with their respective data sources along with the nature of data. The analysis is done using data for

the impact of austerity on Covid-19 fatality rates is done using regression after controlling for all other socio-demographic characteristics which have an (Novel, 2020; Onder et al., 2020; Porcheddu et al., 2020 ; Wu & The advantage of using Quantile regression over normal regression is that it provides a more detailed relationship between variables not only around mean values but across the distribution of (Koenker&Hallock, 2001) .

from Covid-19 in the 19 fatality rates is done using Quantile demographic characteristics which have an (Novel, 2020; Onder et al., 2020; Porcheddu et al., 2020; Wu & uantile regression over normal Ordinary Least more detailed picture of the but across the distribution of outliers and capable of (Baum, 2013; Cade & Noon, 2003; Yu et al., 2003) . The average value of public spending in health to GDP variable, publichelathgdp, is 5.95 % and it has a minimum value of 0.9 per cent and the maximum value of 14.4 per cent. The existing clinical research shows that the fatality rate of Covid-19 is influenced by the existence of pre-medical complication and the share of older adults in the population (Onder et al., 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . The crucial demographic variable, population share above 65 years (popu65), has a mean value of 15 per cent and a standard deviation of 5.4. The share of the population having hypertension (above 18 years of age) has a minimum value of 13 % and a maximum value of 38.2 %. Table 3 shows the result of Quantile regression. The first model has Case Fatality Rate of March 30 as the dependent variable. In the second model, the dependent variable is the threeday median Case Fatality Rate. The results from both models show that the coefficient of the dummy variable for high fund cut has a positive impact on CFR and is significant at one per cent level of significance. The results show that a country which has a history of drastic health fund cut is increasing the fatality rates from Covid-19.Similarly, the coefficient of the variable of public health GDP is negative and significant at one per cent level of significance .

The impact of good health infrastructure (measured by bed per 1000 population and doctor per 1000 population) on Case Fatality Rates is negative. Anticipated as per the existing literature, the result confirms that countries having higher share of old age population have higher fatality rates. Also, higher the share of pre-existing medical condition in the overall population, higher is the fatality rate from COVID-19. The presence of model specification error is done using link test. If the regression model does not contain specification error, then the variable _hatsq will be statistically insignificant. Table 4 shows the result of the link test for Model -1. The P-value of the variable _hatsq is 0.16, and hence it is statistically insignificant. Therefore it can be concluded thatModel-1 does not contain specification error. Similarly, the link test result of Model-2 also shows that the variable _hatsqis not statistically significant. Hence Model-2 also does not contain specification error.
In order to obtain an idea about the coefficients of Quantile regression of independent variables across quantiles of Case Fatality Rates, following figures (2 and 3) have been derived using the Azevedo method (Azevedo, 2011) . It shows how the impact of each independent variable varies across quantiles. .

The coefficients of doctor per 1000 population is negative across the distribution of Case Fatality Rate (except for the second quantile). The coefficients of hospital bed per 1000 population is negative across the distribution of Case Fatality Rate (except till the fourth quantile).
The result from the Quantile regression analysis shows that countries which have pursued austerity policies has significantly higher fatality rates from COVID-19 after controlling for all other socio-demographic factors which influence Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19. Higher public funding share, higher doctors per population, higher bed availability is associated with lower fatality rates from COVID-19. A higher share of population with pre-medical conditions (diabetics, hypertension) and older age population increase fatality rates. So the policies of austerity (at least in terms of reduction in health expenditure) can significantly worsen the health system's ability to fight pandemic like COVID-19 and can lead to a severe negative health outcome. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust publicfunded health system with wider accessibility to deal with major public health crisis like theCovid-19 pandemic.
