Recently classified as a pandemic by WHO, novel Corononavirus 2019 has affected almost every corner of the globe causing human deaths in a range of hundred thousands. The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture.
The pandemic of COVID-19 is taking a troll in health and finance sector of all most 2 every country. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) 3 originated from Wuhan a city in China is mutating while getting transmitted [3] . 4 Development of a potential drug or vaccine is a major challenge. The virus has RNA as 5 a genetic material and it gets mutated frequently. It is very important to understand 6 the evolutionary feature in the virus. Understanding the nature of mutation may help in 7 developing potential drug. Also, it may give direction to understand the next cycle of 8 mutation in the viral genome. Therefore, it is very important to understand the nature 9 of variation in different strains of the novel virus. 10 In this regard, few studies are conducted to understand the nature of variation in 11 this novel virus. Carmine and Federico [4] made an attempt to understand the 12 heterogeneity in 54 strains of this viral genome. Rahila et al. [16] studied impact of the 13 mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability in the novel virus.
14 Changchuan [20] presented a method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses 15 using complete genomes. 16 In this report, an analysis of 468 novel and early virus genome is presented. The 440 17 sequences are from different parts of the world including countries from Europe, USA, 18 Middle East, Asia and 28 sequences submitted from India with 11 sequenced in Iran. 19 The data was downloaded from GenBank, GISAID, and SRA. Data was collected for 20 this study last as of 9th April 2020, with 440 genome sequence of the novel and early 21 strains from the world along with 28 sequences from India. The MEGAX tool [11] has 22 been used to perform the analysis. It is based on Tamura-Nei model and 23 Neighbour-Joining method along with 100 bootstrap. This study adds up a novel 24 non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene only observed in strains 25 obtained from India. Various studies revealed that the NSP3 gene harbours many 26 mutations as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection towards 27 evolution in Betacoronaviruses [18] , [7] . Common mutations among different strains 28 were also identified and reported. The sequence containing the mutation was used to 29 build protein model using SWISS-Model. Followed by the usage of the DynaMut tool to 30 study effect of mutation on protein stability. The results indicate the clade of variations 31 in the Indian SARS-CoV2. Also, potential region of mutations in near future along with 32 the effect of non-synonymous mutation at the protein level. This paper represents the 33 initial observations on submitted 28 sequences of Indian viral strains.
Sequence collection: total 468 sequenced strains were selected, 440 from different parts 36 of the world including countries from Europe, USA, Middle East, Asia and 28 sequences 37 submitted from India with 11 sequenced in Iran. Sequences were downloaded from 38 GenBank, GISAID, and SRA project (PRJNA607948). Information of samples used in 39 this study are provided as supplementary material.
SRA project sequences were aligned to human genome assembly (hg19) using 41 HiSat2 [10] , to remove the human contamination in viral sequences. Next the unaligned 42 region to hg19 was aligned to SARS-CoV2 ref sequence (NC 045512) using 43 SamTools [13] and HiSat2. Consensus fasta sequence of four viral strains of project were 44 obtained using BcfTools [13] . with Tamura-Nei model and Neighbour-Joining method along with 100 bootstrap steps 52 using the MEGAX.
This section describes about the different types of mutations discovered in the analysis 55 along with an analysis of the mutation at protein level.
The Common Mutations 57 Genome sequences of 440 viral strains submitted from different parts of the world were 58 collected from GenBank, GISAID and SRA project. In order to investigate the changes 59 in 28 viral strains submitted from India a sequence level and phylogenetic analysis was 60 performed. Multiple sequence alignment of these collected sequences was visualised to 61 collect the positions in Indian strains with mutations.
There has been a report on SNP mutations in SARS-CoV2 genome which majorly 63 demonstrated mutations frequent in European strains [20] . These mutations were 64 analysed in 28 submitted sequences from India. A previous report from India observed 65 unique mutation in spike protein (A930V (24351C>T)), this mutation was identified in 66 one (Sample 2) of the early infected patients' viral sequence [16] . The most common 67 SNP's that were observed in this analysis includes the previously reported mutation in 68 leader sequence (241C>T), Coronaviruses includes subgenomic identical 5 Leader 69 sequence which plays role in viral replication process. This mutation was seen to replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection [8] . Spike protein has 89 been a hotspot in CoV2 genome since the beginning due to the presence of 90 receptor-binding domain. Contact point to the host includes the domains from S1 91 subunit of this S-protein [19] . The mutation observed 23403A>G (D614G) lies in tail 92 region of this S1 subunit and before the cleavage site of another subunit called S2 of 93 S-protein.

To identify the possible role and relevance of the region observing the 147 mutation, sequence alignment of NSP3 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 was 148 performed. NSP3 gene along with NSP4 are the key players for membrane 149 rearrangement in form of Double Membrane Vesicles (DMV) upon infection [2] . Report 150 on role of mutations in important glycosylation sites in NSP4 gene in SARS-Cov have 151 been observed and were indicative of localisation problems with other NSP protein like 152 NSP3 [5] . As per this there will be a requirement to observe the site of novel change for 153 its impact on NSP3 gene interactions, which may even serve as a potential candidate for 154 therapeutics, depending upon the mutational effect shown in NSP4 [5] . The other 155 predictive outcome can come as benefit to virus in terms of interaction. recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases [9] . Though the very crucial 162 role of SUD-C has not been recognised in SARS-CoV but in few reports SUD-C has 163 been shown to have RNA-binding ability, and concerted actions by the subdomains of 164 SUD have been proposed to ensure specific RNA binding [9] .The complete deletion of 165 the SUD-C domain within the context of a SARS-CoV was found to have large 166 reduction of RNA synthesis, but some basal RTC activity remains [12] . PDB blast 167 confirmed the presence of mutation in SUD domain of SARS-CoV with 74% identity to 168 2KAF (PDB-ID). Using Swiss model this particular domain was modelled for Reference 169 Wuhan sequence (NC 045521)and the change was observed by insilco protein stability 170 tool DynaMut [15] . The change was predicted to be stabilising by DynaMut and The novel Coronavirus, being identified as a global threat have been the prime focus of 178 research and investigation around the globe. Since its outbreak in Wuhan (China) it has 179 taken up several changes to keep the survival high. There are reports by several groups 180 on mutations observed in the strains from different countries [16] [20] [16] . Here, in this 181 study, the primary focus is on strains submitted by India. The country is suspected to 182 have more number of positive cases than actually reported and also, there is increase in 183 the number of cases despite the lockdown implemented by the government. With cause of this is unclear, but there is a possibility as per previous report that patient 195

This same infected person has another notable 196 change of three consecutive positions (28881G>A, 28882G>A, and 28883G>C) 197 reported mainly in the US. To an extent it clears the doubt that person might have 198 contracted multiple strains (Asian and American), thereby carrying both S and L types 199 of strain along with the US reported mutation. L-type was found to be more aggressive 200 strain before Jan 2020 [17] . People who might have contracted this patient would have 201 been at higher risk of infection. In phylogenetic tree analysis these two strains could be 202 observed without branching from the ancestral strain and in vicinity to reference strain 203 sequence (NC 045512) Figure 2 . tourists (Sample 5 to Sample 9), the person (Sample 4) who had contracted with Italian 220 tourist and 6 (Sample 11 to Sample 16) of the Vero CCL81 isolate P1 sequenced in India. 221 It seems to be absent in the strain sequenced from patient with travel history to Italy. 222 One probable explanation to this novel non-synonymous change could be related to 223 its increased transmission rate since it is being observed to be incorporated in 224 combination with already co-existing mutations [20] . The mutation was predicted with 225 stabilising effect, hence no change at secondary structure level was observed Figure 3 .
Interaction experiments or insilico docking might help to understand its effect more 227 clearly. Adaptive evolutionary changes in NSP3 gene have been discerned with 228 betacoronaviruses, which might contribute towards the host-range or other viral 229 phenotypes [7] . In a recent study [18] on analysing the possible drug targets through The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.041301 doi: bioRxiv preprint 14408C>T, 23403A>G, 4809C>T presented in Figure 4 .
As discerned with reported frequent mutations in Europeans, the inference could be 249 made that these mutations could be correlated to efficiency of viral transmission, since 250 Europe has emerged with most adverse effects by the virus. The virus have been 251 reported with slow changes and thereby found to be circulating in few major forms.
Looking at the data from Indian strains it has majorily the European strain with the 253 novel change observed in this study. The other subtype observed was the Indian citizens 254 sequenced in Iran. In a phylogenetic tree analysis ( Figure 2 ) it was observed that 255 strains containing this novel mutation were branched together and separate clad of 256 citizens came from Iran.
Novel incorporation of one more mutation could be associated with its transmission 258 in Indian population. This change might add up as new member to the group of number 259 of changes the virus has taken in course of evolution in India since the first Italian case 260 identified in Mar 2020. Until now no strain has been declared more lethal in comparison 261 with other, but transmission has been the prime observation, which to an extent could 262 be controlled by social distancing mechanism. This speculation is being made from the 263 very early observations and based on what has been the mutational trend in and around 264 the world. The limitation of this study is the less number of sequences submitted from 265 India. There is an emergent need of more public data sharing from Indian community 266 to track new subtypes of virus, impact of the changes it is incorporating and where the 267 hotspot for therapeutics lies.
