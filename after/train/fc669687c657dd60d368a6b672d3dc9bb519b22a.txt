Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to 33
death. This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, 34 ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics 35 and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the 36 analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression 37 quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency 38 across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory 39 network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and 40 that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. 41
Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that 42 these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic 43 immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms 44 likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. 45 46 47 48 49 : bioRxiv preprint 65 cases occurring in children are of moderate severity and 5.8% are severe or critical 6 , 66 highlighting a need for studying risk factors of illness in this population as well. 67 68 One factor that may underlie variation in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is the extent of 69 gene expression in the airway of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, and 70 TMPRSS2, the host protease that cleaves the viral spike protein and thus allows for 71 efficient virus-receptor binding 7 . Expression of these genes and their associated 72 programs in the nasal airway epithelium is of particular interest given that the nasal 73 epithelium is the primary site of infection for upper airway respiratory viruses, including 74 coronaviruses, and acts as the gateway through which upper airway infections can 75
spread into the lung. The airway epithelium is composed of multiple resident cell types 76 : bioRxiv preprint 5 (e.g., mucus secretory, ciliated, basal stem cells, and rare epithelial cell types) 77 interdigitated with immune cells (e.g. T cells, mast cells, macrophages), and the relative 78 abundance of these cell types in the epithelium can greatly influence the expression of 79 particular genes 8-10 , including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, since the airway 80 epithelium acts as a sentinel for the entire respiratory system, its cellular composition, 81 along with its transcriptional and functional characteristics, are significantly shaped by 82 interaction with environmental stimuli. These stimuli may be inhaled (e.g., cigarette 83 smoke, allergens, microorganisms) or endogenous, such as when signaling molecules 84 are produced by airway immune cells present during different disease states. One such 85 disease state is allergic airway inflammation caused by type 2 (T2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, 86 IL-13), which is common in both children and adults and has been associated with the 87 development of both asthma and COPD in a subgroup of patients 11-13 . T2 cytokines are 88 known to greatly modify gene expression in the airway epithelium, both through 89 transcriptional changes within cells and epithelial remodeling in the form of mucus 90 metaplasia 11, 14, 15 . Microbial infection is another strong regulator of airway epithelial 91 expression. In particular, respiratory viruses can modulate the expression of thousands 92 of genes within epithelial cells, while also recruiting and activating an assortment of 93 immune cells [16][17][18] . Even asymptomatic nasal carriage of respiratory viruses, which is 94 especially common in childhood, has been shown to be associated with both genome-95 wide transcriptional re-programming and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in 96 the airway epithelium 19 , demonstrating how viral infection can drive pathology even 97 without overt signs of illness.
Environments and Asthma in Latino Americans II study (GALA II). This analysis 171 identified 54 co-expression networks representing cell type-specific expression 172 programs such as ciliogenesis, mucus secretion, and pathways of immunity and airway 173 inflammation (Supplementary Table 2 ). The TMPRSS2 gene was contained within one 174 of a set of three highly correlated networks exhibiting strong enrichments for mucus 175 Supplementary Table 4 ). In contrast, we found ACE2 expression to be strongly 192 negatively correlated with expression of both T2 networks (pink: r=-0.61, p=3e-72, 193 saddle brown: r=-0.7, p=2e-102, Figure 2e ,f). To identify subjects with high and low T2 194 inflammation, we hierarchically clustered all subjects based on the expression of genes 195 in the canonical T2 network (saddle brown). This resulted in the identification of two 196 distinct groups we labeled as T2-high (n=364) and T2-low (n=331) (Supplementary 197 Figure 1a ). We found that this expression-derived T2 status was strongly associated 198 with traits known to be driven by T2 inflammation including IgE levels, exhaled nitric Table 2) . Clustering of subjects based on the interferon 240 response network genes resulted in two groups, one highly (interferon-high=78) and 241 one lowly (interferon-low=617) expressing these interferon response network genes 242 (Supplementary Figure 2) . We found that ACE2 expression was 1.7-fold higher in the 243 interferon-high vs. interferon-low group (Figure 4d ). In a previous study, we found that 244 children with nasal gene expression characteristic of the interferon network tended to be 245 infected with a respiratory virus, despite being asymptomatic 19 . To explore the 246 possibility of this relationship in our current dataset, we metagenomically analyzed the 247 RNA-seq data for all subjects to identify those harboring reads for a respiratory virus. 248
This analysis found that 18% of GALA II children were asymptomatically harboring a 249 respiratory virus from one of eight general respiratory virus groups (Figure 4e) . 250
Strikingly, we found that 78% of interferon-high subjects were virus carriers compared to 251 only 10% of interferon-low subjects. These results demonstrate how asymptomatic virus 252 carriage nonetheless stimulates an active viral response that includes ACE2. Similar analysis of the TMPRSS2 eQTL variants yielded three independent eQTL 276 variants (rs1475908 AF=20%, rs74659079 AF=4%, and rs2838057 AF=13%, Figure  277 5b). The eQTL variant rs1475908 was associated with a decrease in TMPRSS2 278 expression (log 2 A FC =-0.37, Figure 5d ), whereas both the rs74659079 and rs2838057 279 was only present in people of African descent and at a low frequency (AF=0.7%, Figure  285 5e). In contrast, the TMPRSS2 eQTL variant associated with decreased expression, 286 rs1475908, occurred across all world populations, with the highest allele frequencies 287 among East Asians (AF=38%), Europeans (AF=35%), intermediate frequencies among 288 Africans (AF=26%) and Ashkenazi Jews (AF=23%), and the lowest frequency among 289
Latinos (AF=17%). The two TMPRSS2 eQTL variants associated with increased 290 expression exhibited much more disparate allele frequencies across world populations. 291
Namely, the allele frequency of rs74659079 is above 1% only among people of African 292 descent (AF=11%) and 4% in the participating Puerto Rican population. Likewise, the 293 rs2838057 eQTL variant, which was associated with increased TMPRSS2 expression 294 was present at a frequency of 32% in East Asians, 20% in Latinos, and <10% in all 295 other world populations. Together, these results suggest that if TMPRSS2 levels 296 influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, then genetics may play a significant role in 297 infection risk and that this risk will vary significantly across world populations. Our analyses indicate that T2 inflammation, interferon/viral response signaling, and 303 genetics are all determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in the airway 304 epithelium of children. Therefore, we next sought to determine the relative importance of 305 these factors in determining levels of these genes using multi-variable regression 306 analysis. We included asthma status, age, and sex as model covariates since chronic 307 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Modeling ACE2 expression among GALA II 309 children, we found that T2 and interferon statuses had the strongest effects on ACE2 310 expression (p=1.6e-57, p=6.5e-43, respectively), with T2-low and interferon-high 311 individuals exhibiting the highest levels of expression. These two variables 312 independently explained 24% and 17% of the variance in ACE2 expression (Table 1) . 313
While the ACE2 eQTL variant, rs181603331, was associated with a notable decrease in 314 ACE2 levels, it only accounted for 1.2% of the variance, reflecting the low frequency of 315 this variant in our population. Increasing age and asthma diagnosis were both 316 associated with small decreases in ACE2 expression, although both variables 317 accounted for less than 2% of the variance, and sex was not a significant predictor 318 (Table 1) . 319 320 Similar modeling of TMPRSS2 expression found that T2-high status dramatically 321 increased expression, with an effect size 5.4x larger than any other variable, capturing 322 33% of total variation in TMPRSS2 (Table 1) Table 5 ). This allowed us to explore airway 334 transcriptomic responses to infection with coronavirus subfamily viruses specifically, 335 which will likely most resemble responses to SARS-CoV-2. To increase the likelihood 336 that these subjects were experiencing an active viral infection, we limited our analysis to 337 the 11 most highly infected subjects, comparing them to all subjects not infected with a 338 virus (n=571). To allow us to discriminate CoV-enhanced responses from those that are 339 more general to respiratory viruses, we also established a virus control group composed 340 of the 37 subjects highly infected with human rhinovirus species (HRV) (Supplementary 341 Table 6 ). We first compared expression of genes in the cytotoxic immune response 342 (purple) network and interferon response (tan) network (discussed earlier; see Figure  343 4a, b) among these virus infected groups, and found that both networks were more 344 highly expressed in virus-infected individuals (Figure 6a, b) . Moreover, while the 345 induction in interferon response was similar for both CoV and HRV groups, induction in 346 the cytotoxic immune response was considerably higher in CoV-infected (ΔE g = 0.049) 347 compared to HRV-infected individuals (ΔE g = 0.032, Figure 6b ). 348
To further explore this increase in cytotoxic immune response and other potential 349 pathways in CoV-infected individuals, we next performed a transcriptome-wide screen 350 for genes differentially expressed in CoV or HRV-infected groups compared to 351 uninfected individuals. These analyses revealed 2,515 differentially expressed genes 352 (DEGs) with CoV infection and 2,357 DEGs with HRV infection (FDR < 0.05 and log 2 FC 353 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034454 doi: bioRxiv preprint > |0.5|), of which 35% and 31% were only observed with CoV and HRV infections, 354 respectively, based on our significance cutoff (Figure 6c ). Upstream regulator analysis 355 with IPA carried out separately on CoV and HRV infection response genes showed that 356 the top cytokines and transcription factors that may regulate these infections are shared 357 between the two virus families, including IL10, IL1B, IFNG, IFNA2, and STAT1 ( Figure  358 6d). One inferred upstream regulator of CoV response genes, IL-6, which was also 359 among the genes upregulated with CoV infection (log 2 FC=2.2, Figure 6e ), is especially 360 noteworthy considering that an IL-6 blocking antibody therapy is currently under 361 investigation for use in treatment of COVID-19 illnesses 24 . Additionally, we found ACE2 362 among the shared upregulated genes, reinforcing its upregulation in the course of 363 different respiratory virus infections (log 2 FC in CoV + =0.6, log 2 FC in HRV + =0.5, Figure  364 6e). 365
In trying to understand the biological basis of the viral responses we found to be CoV-367 specific in our differential expression analysis, we considered whether the differential 368 presence and/or response of various immune cell types was an explanatory factor. To 369 investigate this, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to test for enrichment of 370
CoV-specific, HRV-specific, and CoV/HRV-shared DEG sets among gene markers for 371 important role for activation of cytotoxic T cells though antigen presentation by dendritic 377 cells in CoV infections (Figure 6f ). Also supporting an enriched cytotoxic response 378 among CoV-infected subjects was a strong enrichment for CoV-specific DEGs among 379 NK cells, which participate heavily in the killing of virally infected cells (Figure 6g ). We 380 note that these enrichments were not observed among HRV-enhanced DEGs, which 381
were instead most strongly enriched among neutrophils, as well as eosinophils, 382 macrophages, and monocytes. Furthermore, through pathway analysis we identified 383 multiple pathways related to cytotoxic T cell and NK cell activity that were enriched 384 either specifically or more dramatically among CoV DEGs compared to HRV DEGs 385 In the current study, we reasoned that population variation in upper airway expression 394 of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the virus-activating TMPRSS2 protease, 395 would drive infection susceptibility and disease severity. We therefore deployed network 396 and eQTL analysis of nasal airway epithelial transcriptome data from a large cohort of 397 healthy and asthmatic children to determine mechanisms associated with airway 398 expression of these genes, and their relative power in explaining variation in the 399 .

We observed only weak associations with 400 asthma status, age, and gender among children aged 8-21 years. Moreover, although 401 we found that genetics does influence expression of these genes, the effect of this 402 variation was small in comparison to the dramatic influence of T2 cytokine-driven 403 inflammation on both ACE2 (downregulation) and TMPRSS2 (upregulation) expression 404 levels. We found an equally important role for viral-driven interferon inflammation in 405 regulating levels of ACE2 in the airway. Additionally, through study of in vivo upper 406 airway CoV subfamily infections, we not only identify inflammatory regulators of these 407
infections, but also provide evidence that this subfamily of viruses drives an enhanced 408 cytotoxic immune response. Our work provides a set of biomarkers that can be easily 409 examined in COVID-19 patients, through analysis of nasal swabs, to determine the 410 relative importance of these mechanisms and genes in governing susceptibility to 411 infection, severe illness and death. cells. However, we caution that a cell may not need to be TMPRSS2 + to be susceptible 420 to infection, since it has been demonstrated the TMPRSS2 protein is secreted from 421 nasal airway epithelial cells 26 . We also caution that scRNA-seq data are known to 422 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In line with this possibility we 424 observe more moderate levels of ACE2 expression in our bulk RNA-seq data on nasal 425 brushings. 426 427 Airway inflammation caused by type 2 cytokine production from infiltrating immune cells 428 plays a prominent role in the control of cellular composition, expression, and thus 429 biology of the airway epithelium 11, 13, 23, 27 . Moreover, while T2 airway inflammation is an 430 important driver of T2-high asthma and COPD disease endotypes, it is also associated 431 with atopy in the absence of lung disease, a very common phenotype in both children 432 and adults. In fact, among the children in this study, we find that 43% of non-asthmatics 433 were scored as T2-high based on expression profile, further substantiating the high 434 prevalence of T2 airway inflammation outside of those with lung disease. Our data 435 suggest that airway epithelial TMPRSS2 expression is highly upregulated by T2 436 inflammation, and specifically by IL-13. Both our network and single cell data show that 437 TMPRSS2 is most prominent in less developed "early secretory" cells as well as in more 438 mature mucus secretory cells. Based on our in vitro data, IL-13 upregulates TMPRSS2 439 across nearly all types of epithelial cells, but the core of this effect appears to be in the 440 induced metaplasia. In contrast to enhanced levels of TMPRSS2, T2 inflammation, 446 whether observed in vivo or induced with IL-13 stimulation, precipitated a dramatic 447 reduction in levels of epithelial ACE2, thus complicating expectations for how T2 448 inflammation might affect overall risk for a poor COVID-19 outcome. Germane to this 449 question, a recent study of 85 fatal COVID-19 subjects found that 81.2% of them 450 exhibited very low levels of blood eosinophil levels 4 . Blood eosinophil levels are a 451 strong, well-known predictor of airway T2 inflammation and were strongly correlated 452 with T2 status in our study as well 11, 23 . Together, these studies provisionally suggest 453 that T2 inflammation may predispose individuals to experience better COVID-19 454 outcomes through a decrease in airway levels of ACE2 that override any countervailing 455 effect from increased expression of TMPRSS2. However, both in vitro experiments 456 examining IL-13 effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and empirical data on COVID-19 457 outcomes among T2-high and T2-low patients will certainly be needed to determine 458 whether this common airway inflammatory endotype ultimately protects against or 459 exacerbates COVID-19 illness. As mentioned above, we note that measurement of 460 blood eosinophil levels could be used as an informative and more accessible (albeit less 461 powerful) proxy for investigating the association between airway T2 inflammation and 462 outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, given the higher frequency of T2 inflammation 463 among asthmatic subjects, this population should be monitored especially closely given The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034454 doi: bioRxiv preprint In addition to a strong negative influence of T2 inflammation on ACE2 expression in the 468 airway, we found an equally strong positive influence of respiratory virus infections on 469 levels of this gene. Network analysis placed ACE2 within an interferon viral response 470 network suggesting that these cytokines are a driving force behind ACE2 upregulation. 471
This information is interesting in several regards. First, it suggests that SARS-CoV-2 472 and other coronaviruses using ACE2 as a receptor could leverage the host anti-viral 473 response to increase the infectability of airway cells. Secondly, as data here and 474 elsewhere show, asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses is common, especially in 475 young children 19, 28-31 . Children in the GALA II cohort included in this study ranged in 476 age from 8-21 years; among them we found 18% who were carrying respiratory viruses 477 without illness. However, as we show in this and our previous study 19 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034454 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our evaluation of genetic influences on airway ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression 491 revealed a single rare eQTL for ACE2 and several more frequent eQTL variants for 492 TMPRSS2. While both the effect size and explanatory power of these variants paled in 493 comparison to the influence of T2 inflammation and interferon signaling in multi-variable 494 modeling of expression for these genes, the effect of these variants may still be strong 495 enough to alter infection rates and or illness severity, especially in the populations 496
where these variants are most frequent. Thus, future genetic studies of COVID-19 497 should pay particular attention to these eQTL variants. 498
A particularly vexing question regards the mechanisms that underlie the unusual 500 severity of illness associated with SARS-CoV-2, especially when compared to most 501 circulating respiratory viruses. Clearly, severe disease often entails development of 502 pneumonia, possibly resulting from an expanded tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to include 503 lower lung airway and alveolar cells. The most severe patients also appear to 504 experience an exuberant immune response, characterized a "cytokine storm" 24 , 505 occurring with and possibly driving the development of acute respiratory distress 506 syndrome (ARDS). Supposing that aspects of epithelial response to coronavirus family 507 members would be shared, including with SARS-CoV-2, we examined in vivo 508 coronavirus infection among the GALA II children. We found that CoV infections elicit a 509 broad airway transcriptome response, similar to HRV infections, and we identified a 510 panel of cytokines and transcription factors that likely regulate these responses. In 511 particular, we found that IL-6 was predicted to regulate responses to CoV and was itself 512 upregulated with these infections. These data support the recent investigation of 513 .

Although preliminary, this finding, if similarly occurring with SARS-CoV-2 518 infection, could partly explain the dramatic inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 519 patients, which can extend to the distal lung. 520
In summary, our data suggests that the strongest determinants of airway ACE2 and 522 TMPRSS2 expression are T2 inflammation and viral-induced interferon inflammation, 523 with limited but noteworthy influence from genetic variation. Whether these factors drive 524 better or worse clinical outcomes remains to be determined, but closely watching 525 individuals with these airway endotypes in the clinical management of COVID-19 526 illnesses would be prudent.

The Genes-Environment & Admixture in Latino Americans study (GALA II) is an on-563 going case-control study of asthma in Latino children and adolescents. GALA II was 564 approved by local institutional review boards (UCSF, IRB number 10-00889, Reference 565 number 153543, NJH HS-2627) and all subjects and legal guardians provided written 566 informed assent and written informed consent, respectively 32, 33 . A full description of the 567 study design and recruitment has been previously described elsewhere 32-34 . Briefly, the 568 study includes subjects with asthma and healthy controls of Latino descent between the 569 ages of 8 and 21, recruited from the community centers and clinics in the mainland U.S. 570
and Puerto Rico (2006-present). Asthma case status was physician-diagnosed. 571
Recruited subjects completed in-person questionnaires detailing medical, 572 environmental, and demographic information. Physical measurements including 573 spirometry were obtained, and subjects provided a blood sample for DNA extraction and 574 later Whole Genome Sequencing. GALA subjects that were part of this analysis were all 575 recruited from Puerto Rico (n=695). A nasal airway inferior turbinate brushing was used 576 to collect airway epithelial cells from these subjects for whole transcriptome sequencing 577 (n=695). Network analyses were performed on all subjects with nasal brushing whole 578 transcriptome sequencing data (n=695) and eQTL analysis was performed on the 579 subset (n=681) with whole genome sequencing generated genotype data.

To ensure we selected subjects that were experiencing an active host response to a 722
CoV infection, we examined the distribution of viral reads for the 18 CoV + infected 723 subjects. We observed a clear break between the 7 subjects with the lowest viral read 724 counts (<3,000 reads) and 11 subjects with the highest viral read counts (>60,000 725 reads). Therefore, we selected these 11 highly infected subjects for analysis of host 726 responses to CoV infection. To generate a similar infection-control group, composed of 727 subjects highly infected with a different virus species, we examined the 67 HRV infected 728 subjects in GALA, enforcing a comparable lower bound of viral reads as with CoV, 729 adjusting for the smaller HRV genome size. Specifically, HRV genomes are ~7,000 730 base pairs, whereas CoV genomes are ~30,000 base pairs, making the HRV genome 731 ~25% of the size of the CoV genome. Therefore, we selected a cutoff of 15,000 viral 732 reads for subjects to be included in the HRV + highly infected group. Therefore, we 733 selected a cutoff of 15,000 viral reads for subjects to be included in the HRV + highly 734 infected group (n=37) analyzed in Figure 6 . All non-infected subjects (n=571), based on 735 the Virus Finder analysis described above, were used as comparison group for the 736 CoV + and HRV + groups. 737
In performing the CoV + and HRV + transcriptome-wide differential expression analyses, 738 to account for the class imbalance of this experiment, log 2 count-normalized expression 739 values in units of counts per million (calculated using edgeR v3.28.0) were passed to 740 the function arrayWeights function in the limma 55 R package (3.42.0). limma-voom was 741 then used to perform differential expression analysis on the count normalized 742 .

Lowly expressed genes (detected in fewer than 4 cells) were also removed. We then 793 performed normalization using SCTransform 60 and ran PCA on the top 5000 highly 15 clusters. We then ran differential expression analysis using a Wilcoxon test 806 implemented in Seurat's "FindMarkers" function to help with cell type identification. 807
Based on these cluster marker lists, two clusters were merged into a single secretory 808 cluster, another two clusters were merged into a single ciliated cluster, and a final two 809 clusters were combined as "indeterminate," based on the lack of defining marker genes 810 for these clusters. Through this merging process, we arrived at 8 epithelial and 3 811 
As with the nasal brushing scRNA-seq data, 10X scRNA-seq data from ALI cultures 829 grown from a single tracheal donor that were either mock-or IL-13 stimulated for 10 830 days were pre-processed using Cell Ranger (version 3.0, 10X Genomics). To safeguard 831 against doublets, we removed all cells with gene or UMI counts exceeding the 99th 832 percentile. We also removed cells expressing fewer than 1,500 genes or for which > 833 populations, which we visualized in two dimensions using UMAP (see Figure 3d ). These 847 clusters were assigned cell type labels based their most upregulated genes, which were 848 identified by carrying out differential expression analysis between each cluster and all 849 others using Seurat's logistic regression (LR) test, in which cell treatment was included 850 as a latent variable.
