triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in 23 severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV 24
virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for 25 entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in 26 cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS 27 system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced 28 reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe 29 acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of 30 ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. 31
Methods: Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome 32 organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial 33 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the 34 ACE2 gene. 35
Results: We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, 36 CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory 37 responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, 38
respectively. 39
Conclusion: Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory 40
interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral 41 silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular
Within months of the first reports [1], the COVID-19 outbreak has become a pandemic 47 depth characterization of the regulatory control regions within ACE2 and their activity in lung 92 tissue. Regulatory elements located within ACE2 affect the expression levels of the PIR and 93 CA5B genes. PIR and CA5B are involved in NF-kB regulation and pyrimidine synthesis, 94 respectively. VPS13C, encoding a factor required for late stage endosome maturation, is also 95 controlled by a putative enhancer located in intron 11 of BMX, adjacent to ACE2. We propose 96 that ACE2 repression by SARS-CoV-2 trips a chromatin-based switch that coordinates the 97 activity of these regulatory elements and thus the genes they control. Collectively, these 98 changes inadvertently lead to the development of a pro-viral replication environment. 99 100 101 102 .

We selected all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from dbSNP (build153) 105 with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% that were located within chrX:15,519,996-106 15,643,106, which included the ACE2 gene and its flanking region (hereafter ACE2 locus). 107 SNP positions are as reported for the human genome build hg38 release 75 (GRCh38). 108
Identification of tissue-specific SNP-gene spatial relationships in the ACE locus 109
We used the CoDeS3D algorithm [23] to identify putative spatial regulatory interactions for all 110 SNPs at the ACE2 locus (S1 Fig). CoDeS3D integrates data on physical chromatin interactions 111 within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data 112 to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To get lung-specific spatial 113 connections, we identified SNP-gene pairs across lung-specific Hi-C libraries using published 114 data for IMR90, A549, and NCI-H460 cell lines and lung tissue (GEO accession numbers 115 GSE35156, GSE43070, GSE63525, GSE105600, GSE105725, GSE92819, GSE87112, S1 116 for their potential to act as spatial eQTLs. None of the common SNPs we tested affected ACE2 149 expression levels in lung tissue (S2 Table) . 150
The wider ACE2 locus (chrX: 15,519,996-15,643,106; GRCh38/hg38) sits within a 151 topologically associating domain (TAD) that is conserved across some tissues, e.g. IMR90 (Fig  152   1A ). Therefore, it was not surprising that we identified control elements within this ACE2 locus 153 ( Fig 1A) . The distribution of targets for the putative control elements we identified is consistent 154 with previous studies that show that while the majority of significant eQTLs fall within 100 kb 155 of the transcription start site of a gene, only 60% of all eQTLs are upstream of the gene they 156 regulate [32] . Notable amongst the elements we identified are long distance trans-regulatory 157 interactions involving: 1) rs1399200:VPS13C (chr15:61,852,389-62,060,473; encodes 158 vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13C); and 2) rs6632680:PHKA2 (chrX:18,892,300-159 18,984,598; encodes phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 2) (S2 Table) . 160
We identified eighty genetic variants within the ACE2 locus as cis-acting spatial eQTLs that 161 physically modulate the expression of genes PIR (encodes Pirin), CA5BP1 (a pseudogene of 162 CA5B), and CA5B (encodes mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase) in lung tissues (S2 Table) . The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 15, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.042002 doi: bioRxiv preprint enhancing CA5B transcription. These variants occurred in two clusters: 1) within the ACE2 168 gene; and 2) within the CLTRN (TMEM27) genea known homologue of ACE2. Expression 169 of CA5BP1, a pseudogene of CA5B, was also repressed (log2[aFC] -0.21 ± 0.01) by 6 SNPs 170 within the ACE2 locus. Within ACE2 itself there were only control regions for the PIR and 171 CA5B genes (Fig 1B) . 172
The common variants that we tested show an unusual ancestry associated pattern of minor 173 allele frequencies ( Fig 1B) . Specifically, the East Asian population (1K Genomes project) 174 displays little variation across the bulk of the variants we analyzed. This observation is 175 supported by measures of genetic diversity (FST) between the Indian, Chinese and Malay 176 populations within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort 177 (S3 Table) . However, this pattern breaks down at several positions across the ACE2 gene 178 (including rs4646142, rs2285666, and rs2106809, which show significant selection towards 179 the reference allele) in all of the tested populations, indicating potential selective pressure at 180 these loci ( Fig 1B) . Notably, two of these variants alter potential transcription factor binding 181 sites (i.e. rs2285666 alters HNF1, and Ncx motifs, rs2106809 alters a CEBPB motif; S4 Table) . 182
All three variants (rs4646142, rs2285666, and rs2106809) have previously been associated 183 with allele, sex and ethnicity specific impacts on hypertension, blood pressure, hypertrophic 184 cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction (reviewed in [33] .

We identified transcription regulatory elements for CA5B and PIR that are active in lung tissue 190 and are located within the ACE2 gene. We also identified a transcription regulatory element 191 (located in the BMX gene, adjacent to ACE2) for the PIR and VPS13C genes. It is sterically 192 impossible for a single DNA sequence to simultaneously be transcribed and regulate another 193 gene through a physical connection. Therefore, we propose that SARS-CoV-2-induced 194 chromatin-dependent repression of ACE2 expression in lung enables the regulatory sites, 195
repressing PIR and activating CA5B, to exhibit increased functionality in infected cells (Fig 2) . 196
We hypothesize that this regulatory change extends to coordinate changes in the expression of 197 VPS13C and PHKA2 in ways that promote viral proliferation. This host regulatory network has 198 not evolved to benefit the virus but rather, these regulatory changes inadvertently produce an 199 environment advantageous for the virus. . PIR encodes a non-heme iron binding protein that is a redox switch that 218 modulates the binding of p65 (RelA) to NF-κB responsive promoters [46] . NF-κB regulates 219 multiple immune function aspects, including the production of pro-inflammatory 220 cytokines [47] . Therefore, it is notable that repressor regulatory sequences for PIR sit within 221 the ACE2 gene (Fig 2A) . We postulate that the chromatin modifications that silence ACE2 222 expression upon early stage infection activate the PIR repressor ( Fig 2B) . This reduces 223 responsiveness of NF-κB, and thereby delays the expected and needed anti-viral response. 224
Reduction in PIR expression would also reduce the impact of any changes to intra-cellular 225 redox state caused by that SARS-CoV-2 infection, however little is known and future 226 experiments are required to clarify this. the GUSTO study group for comments on the manuscript.

This results in a reduction in the production 538 of PIR -the redox switch necessary for NF-κB activation, while also increasing pyrimidine 539 synthesis, which is necessary for viral replication. 540 541 Supplementary Tables 542 S1 .
