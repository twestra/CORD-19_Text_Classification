The infection with SARS-CoV-2 has become pandemic since the first cases have been reported from 49 the Hubei province to the WHO on Dec. 31 st , 2019. This led to a global health crisis with impacts for 50 each individual patient infected with COVID-19, societies and economies.
Dynamic movement patterns, high contagiousness in combination with an estimated substantial 52 asymptomatic and undocumented proportion of infected people 1 enables a fast spread of the infection 53 and might only be slowed down by drastic disease containment efforts while vaccination and therapy 54 are lacking. [2] [3] [4] The current situation in Italy and other parts of Europe proves that the previous 55 measures for disease control did not suffice and that even countries with a strong health care 56 infrastructure are not adequately staffed with critical care resources. Its current spread in low income 57 countries or those with weak healthcare systems is to be feared.
Besides more aggressive containment, more efforts towards an evidence-based clinical diagnosis, 59 treatment and monitoring including the utilization of new technologies and artificial intelligence are 60 to be strived for. 5 The global spread of COVID-19 demands a global response across national borders.
We perceive an urgent need for systematic data collection, comprising imaging data and analysis, of 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, we wish to initiate an open-access platform 63 for data collection using commonly developed criteria for multi-modal diagnostics, staging and 64 monitoring of the disease. This will serve as a mandatory foundation for swiftly conducting future 65 clinical trials aiming at investigating novel diagnostic and therapeutic options.
At present, real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) is commonly used for diagnosis of COVID-19.
This method, however, requires sophisticated lab technology and material with limited availability.
Until now, the results are available earliest the next day. Meanwhile, the patient has to be treated as 70 potentially COVID-19 positive, requiring costly isolation for safety of staff and eventually cohort 71 isolation with a risk to get infected therein. While this method detects the virus, it does not provide 72 quantitative data on the extent or stage of the disease. Fang et al. claimed that the sensitivity of rt-73 PCR at +3/-3 days after the appearance of external symptoms is only 71%. 6 The study also found that 74 in 98% of patients at the same stage, abnormalities that are characteristic of viral pneumonia are 75 visible in computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. 6 The correlation of COVID-19 infection with features 76 in chest CT has been confirmed by other studies. 7 A sensitivity of 91.9% for a combination of a chest 77 CT and rt-PCR test, compared to 78.2% for a single rt-PCR alone or 86.2% for two subsequent rt-PCR 78 tests was found. 7 Researchers from China and the Netherlands examined data from 1,014 patients and 79 concluded that CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 and furthermore offers the show preference for middle-aged to elderly individuals with comorbidities, 11 the imaging information 91 could be combined with other patient characteristics to predict the prognosis of patients, so as to 92 identify those requiring intensive medical care. 12,13 Early stages of COVID-19 pneumonias mainly 93 involve pure GGOs evolving to multiple GGOs with consolidations in lesions and crazy-paving pattern 94 in a progressive stage. 14,15 This disease monitoring by chest CT imaging has already been used in studies 95 to determine treatment regimens of patients. 11 We conjecture that the aggregation of radiomics 96 features in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically 97 All rights reserved.

As comorbidities have been described as a variable with prognostic value, study data for 106 comorbidities such as hypertension [10] [11] [12] [13] [16] [17] [18] , cardiovascular diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] 16, 17, 19, 20 , chronic obstructive 107 lung disease and other respiratory system diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] 16, 17, 19, 20 , diabetes [10] [11] [12] [13] [16] [17] [18] 20 and malignant 108 diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] 17, 19, 20 have been pooled (Figure 1 , left). Clinical symptoms include fever, 10-13,15-21 cough, 10-109 13,15-21 expectorations, [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 21 hemoptysis, 10, 11, 16, 18 dyspnea, [10] [11] [12] [13] 15, 16, [19] [20] [21]

Depending on the stage of the disease 114 consolidations 16-19,21 , intra-18,21 and interlobular 16-18,21 septal thickening, crazy paving pattern, [16] [17] [18] 115 spider web signs 16,18 and air bronchogram sign 17,19,21 were observed (Figure 1 , right). In contrast, pleural 116 effusion 16-19,21 and lymphadenopathy [16] [17] [18] [19] 21 were found rarely and do not seem to be typical for COVID-117 19 pneumonia. Although current evidence for COVID-19 pneumonia relies on data from preliminary 118 clinical studies and thus is most likely subjected to change over time, we illustrated that some clinical 119 symptoms and radiological findings were found more frequently than others, supporting a diagnosis 120 of COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas others seem to be very rare and support a consideration of other 121 differential diagnoses (Figure 1) . Nevertheless, or precisely because of it, these parameters were 122 included in the eCRF to enable a solid decision-making.
An approach for unified data collection and analysis using comparable criteria
Our proposal emphasizes the importance of quality, integrity and traceability of data to allow for later 125 epidemiological analysis and application of artificial intelligence algorithms. We wish to establish an 126 optimized digital signature of the disease consisting of imaging biomarkers, patient history and other 127 clinical follow-up data obtained in a reproducible matter. We demonstrate, that such a standardized 128 diagnostic procedure can be easily and globally implemented.

A standardized assessment is only possible if the imaging findings are quantitatively 132 collected and evaluated on a supra-regional, preferably global level using comparable criteria. A 133 representative assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia will be enabled by using the collected annotated 134 data consisting of primary imaging data and secondary clinical data. These provide structured primary 135 data that can be universally shared and analyzed. Therefore, an electronic case report form was 136 developed on the basis of the mint lesion TM medical software product platform (Mint Medical GmbH,
Heidelberg, Germany) (Figure 2, 3) .
The template is available free of charge and has already been deployed to university hospitals and 139 health care providers in 8 countries around the world, including severely affected regions of the United 140 Figure 2 : System. architecture cloud-based web platform. Every health care center has the possibility upload anonymized data to the web platform and use the eCRF based on the mint lesion medical product software package. Figure 3 : COVID-19 electronic case report form on mint lesion TM software platform. Here: Exemplary patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT at two subsequent time points. The patient was assessed and evaluated using the eCRF by an experienced radiologist. The assessment and evaluation are performed directly on primary imaging data and automatic rule-based evaluation of the disease progression. The patient was included in a clinical trial directly without the necessity of further data collection or twofold data documentation.

The particular strength of the developed eCRF lies in the fact that any imaging-based value is 175 immediately linked to its context, e.g. anatomical location, but also further related data of clinical 176 significance. Due to the integration in the mint lesion software platform minable data is obtained in a 177 semantic data model with a HIPAA-and FDA CFR Part 11-ready audit trail, immediately applicable for 178 Phase I-III clinical trials and other medical research.

The proposed solution supports the detection and standardized recording of clinical and radiological 186 disease features consistent with the course of COVID-19 infection as well as the relevant 187 epidemiological disease history. We envisage that this data-driven approach will be used in current 
Our approach has limitations. Data acquisition and handling of an eCRF is more time consuming than 213 a reading in clinical routine. Further, integral data acquisition of imaging and clinical parameters 214 requires an interdisciplinary input, which might not be available for every case. Currently, the template 215 is designed for CT imaging only, but providing an eCRF for Chest-X-rays can be realized easily and is the 216 scope for future work. Lastly, it might also appear controversial, that an increased research effort is 217 encouraged even though manpower is limited during the current pandemic. The primary goal is to 218 provide a tool for future clinical studies which are urgently needed.
We do not want to present a predefined global standard for the assessment and reporting for patients 220 with COVID-19 infection, instead the intention is to initiate an evidence-based approach to define a 221 joint global standard that can be adapted to the dynamic situations and discoveries yet to come. This 222 might also discover regional difference in the disease leading to a personalized patient management.
The eCRF can be adapted and refined according to evidence generated in ongoing and future clinical 224 trials but also through the crowd-intelligence approach itself. Any addition or changes in template 225 parameters will not put previously collected data in danger. Data integrity is permanently ensured, 226 and even retrospective acquisition of certain parameters will be possible if applicable.
Chest CT as a supporting tool for diagnosis and furthermore therapy monitoring has distinct benefits 228 such as short turnaround time of the CT, wide availability of the equipment and the possibility of 229 assessing the stage of the disease including response to therapeutic measures. However, it needs to 230 be emphasized that even though the reporting is conducted directly on the CT image data, the eCRF 231 All rights reserved.
