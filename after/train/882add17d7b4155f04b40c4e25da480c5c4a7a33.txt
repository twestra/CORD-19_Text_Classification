The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates the need for accurate and convenient approaches to 2 diagnose and therapeutically monitor respiratory viral infections. We demonstrated that self-3 sampling with foam swabs is well-tolerated and provides quantitative viral output concordant 4 with flocked swabs. Using longitudinal home-based self-sampling, we demonstrate nasal 5 cytokine levels correlate and cluster according to immune cell of origin. Periods of stable viral 6 loads are followed by rapid elimination, which could be coupled with cytokine expansion and 7 contraction using mathematical models. Nasal foam swab self-sampling at home provides a 8 precise, mechanistic readout of respiratory virus shedding and local immune responses. 9

A critical research priority is to develop rapid molecular tests that provide accurate diagnosis, 23 determine infectiousness and transmissibility, and allow for monitoring of viral load during 24 therapy 6 . For numerous viral infections, including influenza, viral load correlates with disease 25 severity and secondary household attack rate 7-9 . Early studies suggest that peak viral load 26 differentiates mild from severe COVID-19 10 .Furthermore, viral load monitoring during antiviral 27 therapy is a mainstay for various human infections including HIV, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus 28 and hepatitis C infections [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Particularly for viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 for which severe 29 clinical outcomes occur in a minority of patients, viral load may serve as a useful surrogate 30 marker to design smaller, but still sufficiently powered treatment studies 4,10 . individuals. Currently licensed flocked swabs may not be optimal for patients with vulnerable 51 mucosal membranes and low platelet counts (e.g. following cytotoxic chemotherapy) because 52 they are associated with some discomfort and possible bleeding. Moreover, their general level 53 of discomfort may deter participants from collecting longitudinal samples. This may limit 54 widespread use for self-testing, especially as surveillance testing or for use in vulnerable 55 patients or children. Importantly, a reliable and comfortable home-based self-testing 56 methodology is needed to prevent potentially infected individuals from entering healthcare 57 facilities to be tested and transmitting virus to healthcare workers and other patients. Initial data 58 on foam swabs are promising, suggesting a broader role for home-based self-swabbing for 59 respiratory viral pandemics 24, 25 . 60 61 .

Serial home-based testing appears to be a well-accepted methodology. 114 115 Steady-state nasal passage viral load kinetics during respiratory virus infections. In the 116 longitudinal sampling portion of our study, we were able to detect 14 viruses including seven 117 human rhinovirus (HRV), two coronavirus (CoV), one bocavirus (BoV), two adenovirus (ADV), 118 one human metapneumovirus (MPV) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases. There 119 were four instances of viral co-infection, though in each case a dominant virus was evident 120 based on greater duration of shedding and higher viral load (Fig 2a) . 121 122 Duration of shedding was heterogeneous. In 5 cases, HRV shedding lasted more than a week 123 with one instance of 5-day shedding and one short single-day blip. RSV and MPV episodes 124 were both prolonged. ADV, BoV and CoV shedding was short-lived, though in one case low-125 level ADV shedding was evident throughout the sampling period (Fig 2a) . 126 127 During most extended periods of HRV, RSV and HMPV shedding, viral loads were remarkably 128 stable from sample to sample (Fig 2a) . For HRV, a generalized pattern of viral load steady state 129 or slight gradual decline, followed by rapid elimination was noted. The single case of RSV had a 130 similar profile but with an initial high viral load peak and shorter duration of shedding. The single 131 case of MPV had a more protracted decline with a single re-expansion phase. These transiently 132 observed periods of steady state viral loads are highly unlikely to occur by chance if true viral 133 loads fluctuated or exhibited stochastic noise. Thus, the sampling method appears highly 134 reliable. These data also suggest a brief period of equilibrium between the virus and local 135 immune system before viral elimination. 136 137 .

In general, the level of 138 symptoms appeared to track with detectable virus, particularly for COV, HRV and MPV. For the 139 single case of RSV, a high number of symptoms persisted beyond viral elimination (Fig 2a) . For 140 all HRV infections of greater than one day, duration of shedding correlated strongly with 141 duration of symptoms (r=0.87). In these HRV infected individuals, symptoms subsided 142 immediately before, concurrent with or soon after viral elimination. Low viral load infections 143 lasting only a day were associated with a smaller number of symptoms than more prolonged 144 higher viral load episodes (Fig 2a) . 145 146 Stable and surging nasal cytokine levels during respiratory virus infection. We next 147 followed the levels of 20 different cytokines during infection measured from the same specimens 148 from which the viral load was measured. For several cytokines particularly those in the Th2, 149
Th17 and non-defined pathways (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A and eotaxin), there was 150 notable stability within and between study participants, independent of viral shedding (Fig 2b,  151 Supp Fig 2b) . Interferon α2a also was relatively invariant across and within persons. This result 152 demonstrates consistency in swabbing technique and yield for molecules that are not impacted 153 by the presence of viral infection, and again validates the precision of our approach. 154 155 Other molecules, particularly those associated with cytotoxic T cell responses (granzyme B, 156 perforin, TNFα and IFNγ) and macrophage responses (MIP-1α, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-18) showed 157 monotonic expansion or clearance in response to most infections, with particularly dynamic 158 shifts during the examples of RSV, HPMV and one instance of HRV (p21) with the highest initial 159 viral load (Fig 2b, Supp Fig 2b) . Other cytokines such as Il-12p70, IL-21, IL-5 and IL-18 were 160 dynamic in participants had monotonic expansion and clearance in response to some but not all 161 infections. 162 163 .

We next examined the six participants 164 with HRV infection for any correlated cytokine patterns to infer cellular origin. Examples of high 165 positive correlations were noted among analytes associated with a cytotoxic T cell response 166 (granzyme B, perforin, TNFα, and IL-6), among several macrophage or epithelial cell derived 167 cytokines (MIP-1α, IL1α, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-21), and among a cluster associated with Th2 168 responses (IL-5, IL-10, IL-17). The Th2 associated cytokines (IL-5, IL-10, IL-17) also correlated 169 with many of the cytolytic T cell and macrophage associated cytokines (Fig 3a) . HRV viral load 170 was only moderately correlated with a number of parameters, particularly granzyme B, perforin, 171 and IP10 which is a protein induced by IFNγ. This result suggests that HRV may not induce an 172 intense local molecular immune response in a dose-dependent fashion. Very similar results 173 occurred with inclusion of all samples from all participants in the cohort (Supp Fig 3a) . 174 175 We next examined cytokine correlations in the 2 persons infected with more inflammatory 176 respiratory viruses: RSV and MPV. We noted similar correlative trends in this data as with HRV. 177
Correlations among related pairs such as granzyme B / perforin, IL-12p70 / IL-21, IL-1 / MIP-178 1alpha, IL-5 / IL-18, TNF-alpha / IL-6, IL-10 / IL-17a and IL-2 / IL-4 were higher for RSV / MPV 179 than for HRV (Fig 3b) . For these cytokine pairs, temporal kinetics were often strikingly similar 180 suggesting an equivalent cellular source (Fig 2b, Supp Fig 2b) . There was also an overall lack 181 of correlation between cytokines associated T cells responses and those associated with 182 epithelial cells and macrophages. Viral load correlated with many cytokines of T cell origin (Fig  183   3b) , suggesting that RSV and MPV may induce inflammation is a dose-dependent fashion. 184 185 Sample clustering according to degree of inflammation. We next sorted all HRV samples 186 using linkage clustering analysis. This approach demonstrated three classes of samples that 187 were distinguished by the levels of many of the T-cell and macrophage-associated molecular 188 immune factors (Fig 3b) .

These samples were 190 from two participants. All six participants had some samples in the least inflammatory class 191 (grey) and 5 participants had samples in the moderate inflammatory class (green). These data 192 indicate that the inflammatory immune milieu in the HRV-infected nasal passage is dynamic 193 over time, but tilts toward higher inflammation with higher viral loads. Very similar results were 194 observed when all samples were analyzed though only two classes of samples were 195 distinguished (Supp Fig 3b) . IFNγ. In the case of these viruses, the more inflammatory cytokine cluster clearly associated 201 with high viral loads for both RSV and MPV (Fig 3d) . 202 203 Mathematical modeling. We performed mathematical modeling separately on data from the 204 participant infected with RSV to examine whether complex immune and viral data from our 205 samples could be coupled mechanistically. We first developed the ordinary differential equation 206 model in equation (1) to link RSV viral load and early and late immune responses and evaluated 207 which cytokines may track those responses. For the early immune response, we found that only 208 the log 10 of the concentration change of IFN-γ and IP-10 was positively correlated to the viral 209 load during the first 5 days after enrollment ( Supp Fig 4a-b) , so we evaluated models for only 210 these two cytokines to track the RSV-early immune response. For the late immune responses, 211 we evaluated the model for fit to all observed cytokines (Supp Fig 4c) . An equivalent approach 212
was carried forward to model MPV. 213 214 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In Fig 4a, we show our resulting model schematic. Differential equations capture the rate of 215 change of susceptible cells, infected cells, viral load (Fig 4b) and two cytokines (Fig 4c-d) . The 216 best fit was achieved with a model assuming IFNγ concentration dependent killing during the 217 first early stages of infection, and IL-21 mediated elimination of infected cells with a mechanism 218 saturating the amount of possible killing above a certain level of IL-21. 219 220
The model suggests that for RSV, an early surge in IFNγ leads to a slight rise in per cell killing 221 rate of infected cells (Fig 4e) leading to a mass elimination of infected cells at a rate of 10 222 million cells per day and a decrease in viral load by a factor of 100-1000. However, this 223 response does not clear the virus. A steady state viral load persists for 4 days until an IL-21 224 mediated response appears. This response kills far more rapidly, but not as intensely as the 225
IFNγ response. Together, these responses remove the remaining infected cells by day 7 after 226 onset of symptoms (Fig 4f) . Model fitting using data in which IP10 provides early clearance 227 rather than IFNγ results in worse fit to the data (Supp Fig 4c, 4d) . For late results, IL-21 228 allowed the best fit and other cytokines was less successful. This suggests that these two 229 molecules may play a major role in RSV control in vivo but does not rule out the effects of other 230 cytokines and effector molecules in limiting infection. 231
We next fit the same model to the data from participant infected with MPV and found that the 233 model is able to recapitulate viral load, IFNγ and IL-21, projects similar killing patterns during the 234 early and late immune responses to the RSV model (Supp Fig 5) . Here we demonstrate that home self-sampling with nasal foam swabs is well-tolerated and 239 provides reliable results for monitoring viral load as well as the molecular immune response to 240 .

These results have enormous practical implications. Self-collection at 241 home is safe, non-invasive and easily learned, allowing a reliable method for diagnosis as well 242 as therapeutic monitoring. Because our kits could easily be used at home or in a drive through 243 testing environment, they provide an avenue to eliminate contact between an infected and 244 contagious person, and health care providers. They could also be used in the hospital or clinic 245 setting, thereby saving personnel time and personal protective equipment. The use of 246 comfortable, safe and affordable foam swabs also highlights the possibility of scaling this 247 approach to pediatric, adult, elderly and immunocompromised populations. For the current 248 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and future deadly respiratory virus epidemics, home self-swabbing will 249 be a vital tool. Additional anatomical sites have also been considered for increasing yield, and current FDA 261 recommendations suggest use of both a mid-turbinate nasal swab and an oropharyngeal swab 262 to maximize yield in the absence of nasopharyngeal swabbing 23 . Our prior data demonstrate 263 that self-collected throat swabs in addition to self-collected foam nasal swabs do not increase 264 yield significantly for respiratory viruses 26 , suggesting that additional oral swabbing may not be 265 needed, especially in the setting of swab shortages.

The specific swab used in these prior 268 studies and our present study were custom designed to limit discomfort while maintaining 269 adequate sensitivity; we have demonstrated stability with these swabs with and without 270 transport media after storage at room temperature for 7 days 24 , making them ideal for home 271 self-testing followed by shipment directly to a testing lab. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has been 272 shown to be highly stable on surfaces 27 , making home foam swabbing a feasible and attractive 273 option for this pathogen. 274
We also demonstrate an ability to accurately sample local cytokines which are present at 276 picogram levels, again using the same foam swabs from which viral measurements were made. 277
The combination of precise virologic and immunologic readouts of local infection is highly 278 relevant for developing clinical severity scores and biomarkers. While studies are beginning to 279
show that viral load may be predictive of COVID-19 severity 10 , it is equally plausible that the 280 intensity and phenotype of the early local cellular immune response plays a causal role in 281 limiting the extent of infection 28 . By following the molecular immune response closely with daily 282 sampling intervals, we also provide adequate data for mathematical models that can link 283 specific arms of the cellular immune response to pathogen control in real time 22 , a goal that has 284 been difficult to attain for a majority of viral infections in humans. 285
Our study demonstrates several novel features of respiratory virus kinetics. RSV infection 287 achieves a brief, extremely high, viral load, followed by a steady state and a final rapid phase of 288 elimination. HRV also has a remarkably stable viral load in most participants before being 289 rapidly eliminated. During a majority of our observed episodes, viral shedding is strongly 290 correlated with symptoms. As viral load decreases, symptoms tend to dissipate. 291 292 .
