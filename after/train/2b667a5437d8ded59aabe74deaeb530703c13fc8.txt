1 precipitation seasonality and the speed of climate 2 temperature warming 3 4
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a rapidly spreading worldwide 11 epidemic; thus, it is a global priority to reduce the speed of the epidemic spreading. 12
Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 13
transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough 14 examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a 15 global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively 16 investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 17 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial 18 analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; 19
however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity 20 rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher 21 precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of 22 population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the 23 temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, 24 which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of 25 the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel 26 restrictions in each country was more significant. Although our findings are preliminary 27 owing to data-analysis limitations, they may be helpful when predicting COVID-19 28 transmission. 29
The world-wide spreading of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [ when 30 and more cases were confirmed in cumulative counts, as described previously 95
[7]. We confirmed that similar conclusions were obtained at the different cut-off values 96 (using the data within 30 days starting from the date when 50 and more cases were 97 confirmed). 98
We obtained climate parameters from several databases based on the observation area 100
latitudes and longitudes available in the dataset [1] . was also considered to remove spatial autocorrelation in the regression residuals. 166
Specifically, the Moran eigenvector approach was adopted using the function 167
SpatialFiltering in the R package spatialreg (version 1.1.5). As with the OLS regression 168 analysis, full models were constructed, and then the best model was selected based on 169
AICc values. The spatial filter was fixed in the model-selection procedures [33] . 170
The contribution (i.e., non-zero estimate) of each explanatory variable to the growth rate 171 of COVID-19 cases was considered significant when the associated p-value was less than 172 0.05. 173
The data in 300 areas were investigated (Figure 1 ). The OLS regression analysis (Table 1)  175 and spatial analysis ( and Argentina were warm in March; however, they show low precipitation seasonality 214 ( Figure 2) . Thus, the spreads might occur in these areas. Moreover, Europe and the USA 215 might have undergone rapid spreads because they show low precipitation seasonality; on 216 the other hand, the spread might have reached a peak relatively quickly in China because 217 of relatively high precipitation seasonality. 218
The contribution of solar radiation is currently ambiguous. Solar radiation showed a 219 positive association with the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. However, the results were 220 less robust; in particular, the contribution was statistically significant in spatial analysis 221 (Table 2 ), but not in the full and averaged models in the OLS regression (Table 1) . Thus, 222
it remains possible that the contributions partly observed in the analyses are artefacts. 223
Assuming the positive association, the result is inconsistent with the fact that solar (UV) 224 radiation is expected to reduce infection disease (e.g., influenza) transmission [13]. 225
Moreover, a pairwise correlation analysis showed no association between the growth rate 226 and solar radiation (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = -0.06, p = 0.31). 227
The contributions of wind speed and precipitation were also limited. This is inconsistent 228
with previous studies [8, 9] ; however, statistical significances were not evaluated in these 229
studies. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the data analyses between this 230 study and previous studies. In particular, previous studies used the measures based on the 231 number of confirmed cases; however, these measures may be affected by the difference 232 of COVID-19 testing between areas. Hence, further examinations may be needed, given 233 the importance of these climate parameters in infectious disease transmission [13, 17] . 234
Non-climate parameters were also associated with the growth rate of According to the estimates of the models of the OLS regression analysis and spatial 236 analysis, the contribution of travel restrictions was most significant than those of the 237 climate parameters; in particular, travel restrictions showed a negative association with 238 the growth rate. This result may be an extension of the result that the reduction of 239 Tables   Table 1.

The results of the full model, best model, and averaged model are shown, respectively. The abbreviations of variables are as follows: Tmean (monthly mean temperature), DTR (monthly diurnal temperature range), Tseasonality (temperature seasonality), Pseasonality (precipitation seasonality), UV (monthly solar radiation index), WV (warming velocity), PD (population density), HDI (human development index), and Ban (travel restrictions).
