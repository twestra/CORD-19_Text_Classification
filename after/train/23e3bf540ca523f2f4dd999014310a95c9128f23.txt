In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief 45 epidemic, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The 46 sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a 47 sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, 48 SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being 49 recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its 50 evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 51 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human 52 intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the 53 lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, 54 the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and 23 impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. 25 After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 26 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous 27 sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution 28 previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-29 2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike 30 receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably 31 due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically 32 circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early 33 outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical 34 steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 35 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 36 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 37 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on 38 infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was 39 two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, Province, China [1 , 2, 3] . Due to the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the 60 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and genome organization similarity, the causal 61 virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [4] . 62 As of 3/16/2020, 167,515 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in 114 63 countries, causing 6,606 fatalities. As a result, WHO declared the first pandemic caused by a 64 coronavirus on 3/11/2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-65 2019/situation-reports). As the virus continues to spread, numerous strains have been isolated 66 and sequenced. On 3/18/2020, more than 500 complete or nearly complete genomes have 67 been sequenced and made publicly available.
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans. Among the other six, 69 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause severe respiratory illness, whereas 229E, HKU1, 70 NL63, and OC43 produce mild symptoms [5] . Current evidence strongly suggests that all 71 human associated coronaviruses originated from other animals, such as bats and rodents [5, 72 6]. While SARS-CoV-2 shares similar genomic structure with other coronaviruses [7-10], its 73 sequence differs substantially from some of the betacoronaviruses that infect humans, such as 74 SARS-CoV (approximately 76% identity), MERS-CoV (43% identity), and HKU-1 (33% 75 identity), but exhibits 96% similarity to a coronavirus collected in Yunnan Province, China 76 from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from bats [2, 77 dN in the RBD region is 0.023, approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the 105 spike gene (0.068), dS in the RBD (0.710) is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the 106 spike sequence (0.651). This argues against the recombination scenario. We noticed that the 107 dS of the whole spike and the RBD, are 2-and 3-fold, respectively, higher than the genome 108 average. Since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection, the increased 109 divergence in dS may reflect an underlying elevated mutation rate. skewed. While the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations, the latter 116 mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes (Fig. 1a) . The excess of low frequency 117 mutations is consistent with the recent origin of SARS-CoV-2 [19]. Both population 118 reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations [20, 21] . However, 119 the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus. If positive selection has 120 been operating, we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as 121 synonymous changes. Furthermore, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes is 122 2.46 (138/56) among singleton variants, but only 1.42 (17/12) among non-singletons. Both of 123 these observations suggest that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations are selected 124 against, with no positive selection in evidence.
The skew of synonymous variants toward high frequency deserves further discussion, 126 as it relates to the underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The puzzle is 127 probably rooted in how high and low frequency mutations are inferred. The results shown in 128 the Fig. 1a are based on an outgroup comparison. The divergence at synonymous sites 129 between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is 17%, approximately 3-fold greater than between 130 humans and rhesus macaques [22] . With such high level of divergence, the possibility of 131 multiple substitutions cannot be ignored, especially since substitution in the coronavirus 132 genome is strongly biased toward transitions (see above). Indeed, among all non-singleton 133 mutations listed in Table 2 , 62% of the changes are C-T transitions.
To get around the potential problem caused by multiple substitutions, we cross- Table 2 ). All three sequences from Singapore share the T nucleotide also found in 139 the RaTG13 outgroup. Using the outgroup comparison, the C found in the rest of the human 140 SARS-CoV-2 sequences is a derived mutation. However, the T at this position is restricted to 141 genomes collected from Singapore on 2/4 and 2/6/2020 and not found in earlier samples. It is 142 thus more sensible to infer that this T is a back mutation derived from C rather than an 143 ancestral nucleotide. Another synonymous change at position 24034 occurred twice 144 (C24034T) on different genomic backgrounds (marked Îº in Fig 2) . Although the outgroup 145 sequence at this position is T, it is more likely that the C at this position is the ancestral novel mutations might be occurred within this patient cannot be 100% ruled out, the 155 alternative explanation that this patient may have been co-infected by two viral strains seems 156 more plausible.
After cross-referencing with the haplotype network and the phylogeny, all mutations 158 listed as high frequency in Table 2 and Fig. 1a were re-assigned to the other side of the 159 frequency spectra. We only see an excess of singleton mutations, consistent with a recent reaching approximately 30% by 1/23/2020, suggesting that 84S may exhibit some advantage 168 over 84L. If genomes carrying 84S were ancestral, it would be a challenge to explain its 169 absence in early samplings. In addition, as mentioned above, C-T transitions are dominant in 170 coronavirus evolution and multiple hits were observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2 ). It is 171 therefore possible that 28814C mutated to T after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 diverged from the 172 common ancestor with RaTG13 and recently changed back to C. Finally, if 84L is indeed a 173 derived haplotype and has rapidly increased in its frequency by positive selection, we would 174 expect haplotypes carrying 84L to have accumulated more derived mutations than haplotypes 175 with 84S. However, after correcting for mutational direction, the two haplotypes exhibited In addition to L84S, a G-T transversion at 26114 which caused an amino acid change 180 in orf3 protein (G251V) is also at intermediate frequency (Table 2) . 251V was first seen on 181 1/22/2020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13% by our sampling date (Fig. 3) . We 182 note that the emergence of 84S in orf8 and 251V in orf3 are consistent with the lockdown of 183 Wuhan on 1/23/2020. The former first appeared in early January, gradually increased its 184 frequency, and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020. The latter showed up on 1/22/2020 and 185 rapidly increased its frequency within two weeks. (Table 1) , such inflation would have a large effect on dN/dS estimates. 193 We therefore excluded singletons from dN and dS estimation.
The dN/dS of orf8 gene in episode I and II and orf3 gene in episode II show strong 195 signatures of positive selection, consistent with increase of 84S and 251V frequency during 196 these periods, and may suggest a role of adaptation (Table 3 ). The overall dN/dS within each 197 episode was 5-10 times higher than dN/dS between coronavirus genomes derived from 198 different species (Table 1 ). The elevated dN/dS of SARS-CoV-2 is either due to its The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is .
However, dN/dS was smaller in episode I than in episode II across the majority of the 203 genome, suggesting that elevation of dN/dS is probably mostly due to the relaxation of 204 selection. We further divided episode I into Ia and Ib, according to the appearance of 84S in 205 orf8 protein on 1/6/2020. The genome-wide dN/dS values were 0.27 and 0.23 for episode 1a 206 and 1b, respectively (S1 Table) . Therefore, as shown in the frequency spectra, the signature 207 of positive selection is weak at the early stage of the epidemic.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2
The estimated mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.4x10 -3 /site/year with 95% highest 210 posterior density (HPD) of 1.5-3.3x10 -3 /site/year. The mutation rate at the third codon 211 position is 2.9x10 -3 /site/year (95% HPD 1.8â4.0x10 -3 /site/year), which is in a good 212 agreement with synonymous mutation rate of SARS-CoV, 1.67â4.67 x 10 -3 /site/year [24] .
SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD 214 11/13/2019â12/23/2019). We have to point out that the TMRCA estimation is strongly 215 influenced by the genome sampling scheme. Since the earliest available genome was sampled 216 on 12/24/2019 almost one month after the outbreak, the real origin of the current outbreak 217 may actually be earlier than our estimation. 218 We estimated genetic variation, including the number of segregating sites,
Watterson's estimator of Î¸, and nucleotide diversity (Ï) of the SARS-CoV-2. Since both Ï 220 and Î¸ are estimators of 4Nu (N and u are the effective population size and mutation rate, 221 respectively), they should be close to each other at the mutation-drift equilibrium [25] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . sequences from China exhibited higher genetic variation in terms of the number of 227 segregating sites, Î¸ and Ï, than the rest of the world combined, consistent with the 228 observation that the outbreak originated in China, as the source populations are expected to 229 exhibit higher genetic variation than derived populations [25] .
The haplotype network also supports this notion (Fig. 2) . Usually, ancestral 231 haplotypes have a greater probability of being in the interior, have more mutational 232 connections, and are geographically more widely distributed. The H1 haplotype is at the 233 center of the network and is found in four countries and many places in China. In addition, a 234 large portion of haplotypes is directly connected to H1. Therefore, it is likely that H1 is the 235 ancestral haplotype. As 45% of H1 are found in Wuhan, this location is the most plausible 236 origin of the ongoing pandemic. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554 doi: bioRxiv preprint and pangolin_2019 have diverged at about 47% of synonymous sites and infect different 251 hosts, the idea that they share five out of six critical amino acids within RBD through 252 convergent evolution seems far-fetched. 253 We therefore hypothesize that, instead of convergent evolution, the similarity of RBD 254 between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin_2019 was caused by an ancient inter-genomic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554 doi: bioRxiv preprint responses in host cells (41-45 [31 , 32-35] . During the SARS spread, frequency of several 300 orf8 mutations fluctuated in accordance with different phases of the outbreak, suggesting that 301 orf8 underwent adaptation during the SARS epidemic [24] . It is suggested that 84S may 302 induce structural disorder in the C-terminus of the protein and may generate a novel 303 phosphorylation target for Serine/Threonine kinases of the mammalian hosts [36] .
SARS-CoV orf3 protein has been shown to activate NF-ÎºB and the NLRP3 305 inflammasome and causes necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage, and caspase-1 activation.
In addition, orf3 is required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence. All of the 307 above likely contributes to the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV infection [37] [38] [39] .
Therefore, these two mutations may have some functional consequences and be worth 309 investigating further. By the time we prepared this manuscript, the 215V frequency ceased to 310 increase. However, a parallel mutation has occurred in a different genomic background, 311 further supporting the idea that this mutation may require further study.
