The SIR ('susceptible-infectious-recovered') formulation is used to uncover the generic spread mechanisms observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R o . The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R o = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled R o are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in R o > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in R o from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%. : medRxiv preprint in epidemiology. This dispute moved inoculation from the domain of philosophy, 4 religion, and disjointed trials plagued by high uncertainty into a debate about 5 mathematical models -put forth by Daniel Bernoulli (in 1766) and Jean-Baptiste le 6 Rond D'Alembert (in 1761), both dealing with competing risks of death and 7 interpretation of trials [1]. Since then, the mathematical description of infectious 8 diseases continues to draw significant attention from researchers and practitioners in 9 governments and health agencies alike. Even news agencies are now seeking out 10 explanations to models so as to offer advice and clarity to their audiences during the 11 (near-continuous) coverage of the spread of COVID-19 [2]. The prospect of using 12 mathematical models in conjunction with data is succinctly summarized by the Nobel 13 laureate Ronald Ross, whose 1916 abstract [3] enlightens the role of mathematics in 14 epidemiology today. A quotation from this abstract below, which foreshadows the 15 requirements and challenges for mathematical models to describe emerging epidemics 16 such as COVID-19 [4, 5], needs no further elaboration: 17
A heated dispute about the effectiveness versus risk of smallpox inoculation was playing 2 out in eighteenth-century France, which was to launch the use of mathematical models 3 this, many and indeed the principal problems of epidemiology on which 23 preventive measures largely depend, such as the rate of infection, the 24 frequency of outbreaks, and the loss of immunity, can scarcely ever be 25 resolved by any other methods than those of mathematical analysis. 26 The classic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) paradigm, initiated in the late 27 1920s [6] , now provides a mathematical framework that describes the core transmission 28 dynamics of a range of human diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , including COVID-19 [13] . A key 29 parameter in the SIR paradigm is the basic reproduction number (R o ). The R o is 30 defined by the average number of secondary cases arising from a typical primary case in 31 an entirely susceptible population of size S o [14] [15] [16] . The usefulness of R o and 32 uncertainty in its estimation are not a subject of debate, as reviewed elsewhere [17] , and 33 therefore are not further discussed here. 34 In the analysis herein, the SIR model is used to uncover generic spread mechanisms 35 observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious 36 spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or 37 enforced in many countries around the world despite early warning signals from China, 38 Iran, and later on, Italy. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in many countries 39 where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of 40 COVID-19 R o . The analysis shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many 41 nations) to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 for COVID-19 describing early times spread. The 42 implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this reference R o are briefly 43 discussed in the context of mortality and maximum infections. Mathematical models of disease spread assume that a population within a compartment 47 (e.g., city, region, country) can be subdivided into a set of distinct classes [11] . The SIR 48 model classifies individuals in the compartment as one of three classes: susceptible (S), 49 infectious (I), and recovered or removed (R). Infectious individuals spread the disease 50 to susceptible and remain in the infectious class for a given period of time known as the 51 April 14, 2020 2/15 infectious period before moving into the recovered (or removed) class. Individuals in the 52 recovered class are assumed to be immune for an extended period (or removed from the 53 population). For the total population N = S + I + R, the dynamical system describing 54 the SIR equations are given as assumption is that the number of deceased individuals is << N . The dynamical system 64 in equation (3) assumption in SIR dynamics is the use of the mass-action principle. As with all 74 compartment models, mass action assumes that the rate of encounter between I and S 75 is proportional to their product. For this assumption to hold, it requires that members 76 of I and S be uniformly distributed in the space of the compartment [18] . Individuals -77 unlike molecules in an ideal solution within a closed container -do not mix 78 homogeneously. At minimum, the use of the mass action principle serves as a reference 79 model to compare more detailed mechanisms or explore data.
The parameters γ and β encode the main properties of the epidemics and the 81 population response to it. The γ = 1/D is generally interpreted as the inverse of the 82 mean recovery time D. The D varies with the nature of the disease and the recovery 83 from it which depends on the medical facilities and resources available. For COVID-19, 84 the best information on the speed of recovery comes from a World Health Organization 85 study examining more than 55000 cases in China [19] . They found that for mild illness, 86 the time from the onset of symptoms to natural recovery is, on average, 14 days. This 87 estimate was also supported in other published studies (e.g., [20] ), though as much as Hence, β = k T r . Factors such as hand-washing and sanitizing reduce T r whereas social 96 distancing, self-isolation, and closure of public spaces reduce k. It is evident that dI/dt 97 will be positive (outbreak) or negative (epidemic contained) depending on the sign of .

Given the value of D 101 (in days), the probability that an individual remains infected in an infinitesimal time 102 period δτ is 1 − γ(δτ ). Therefore, the probability that this individual remains infected 103 for an amount of time τ is lim δτ →0 (1 − γδτ ) τ /(δτ ) = exp (−γτ ). In other words, τ , the 104 time that an infected individual remains infected, is exponentially distributed with an 105 average of D = 1/γ.
In a compartmental model such as the SIR, every individual is susceptible and the 107 average number of susceptibles that encounter an infected individual over a period τ is 108 simply β τ . It follows that the average number of new infections caused by an infected 109 individual, which is the basic reproduction number R o , is given by [21] 110
where the γ after the second equality is to normalize p(τ ).
While the compartmental SIR model, in use here, assumes an exponentially Early-times dynamics of the SIR system 121 An illustration of the canonical SIR dynamics during an epidemic is shown in Figure 1 using the approximation where i = I/S o is the dimensionless fraction of infected individuals and R o = β/γ as 129 before. When R o > 1, di/dt > 0 leading to an epidemic or, conversely, a containment of 130 the disease. The solution of equation (5) is an exponential function Figure 1 .
The R o may be determined by regressing log(i) against t, and the slope of this 133 regression determines R o when γ can be separately estimated. More sophisticated 134 fitting procedures can also be conducted on sampled I(t) versus t. A major limitation to 135 this exercise is that I(t) at early times, often determined from reported confirmed cases, 136 is uncertain and depends on testing frequency that may vary in time as I increases. An 137 alternative is to regress di/dt upon i at early times to detect the highest slope, which 138 can then be used to infer R o . This approach is also featured in Figure 1 , which 139 illustrates that the SIR dynamics exhibit rapid deviations from a linear di/dt with i set 140 by early times thereby underestimating R o (for a given γ). Evidently, inference of R o 141 requires estimates of early time slope, which cannot be easily detected in practice.
A non-conventional approach is to present confirmed infection data using a 143 double-log representation of di/dt versus i, which is also featured in Figure 1 . This 144 April 14, 2020 4/15

It is to be noted that 151 a log-log representation will be more robust to these shifts, because the overall graph 152 will be biased by the initial slope prior to the initialization of expanded testing. Such 153 bias should lead to increases in di/dt versus i, not declines from the initial slope 154 (R o − 1) that can be detected. As later shown, such an increase has been noted in 155 several data sets.
With this representation, it is now shown that initial inaction to COVID-19 across 157 many countries around the globe allowed an ensemble estimate of the uncontrolled R o . 158 Because R o is likely to be at maximum when no action to COVID-19 are implemented 159 early on, a maximum theoretical 'boundary-line' can then be derived to describe the .

Mindful of all the pitfalls in determining R o [17] , the global estimate 176 here of R o = 4.5 is roughly commensurate with other entirely independent estimates for 177 COVID-19. The most recent update from the China study suggests an R o = 4.1 [25] 178 whereas for France, the most recent estimate for early times is R o = 4.9 [26] . The 179 initially reported and the much cited R o = 2.2 value [4] from Wuhan, China appears to 180 be low [27] . A more elaborate estimate of R o based on case reports, incubation periods, 181 high-resolution real-time human travel data, infection data combined with agent-based 182 mathematical models result in R o = 4.7 − 6.6 [27] . Other studies report values between 183 3.3 and 6.6 [28] . It must be emphasized that the R o determined here reflects The same analysis performed for World countries is now applied at a sub-national level, 189 considering Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in the UK and provinces in Italy 190 (Fig. 4) . Results show a higher variability than country-level data (as expected) but the 191 theoretical 'boundary-line' of R o = 4.5 is shown to hold also at finer spatial scales. .

Therefore, the log-log slope will be initially greater 265 than (R 0 − 1) while the rate of testing increases and then converge to (R 0 − 1) 266 asymptotically as testing reaches steady-state. Indeed, this effect is widely observed in 267 the global and smaller-scale data, indicating that the imprint of testing ramp-up fully 268 dissipates (at least at the country scale) and the observed convergent slope remains a 269 robust indicator of the early phases of virus dynamics.
Size of the epidemic 271 The maximum infections I max (where dI/dt = 0) can be derived as a function of S o and 272 R o by first dividing the budgets of dS/dt and dI/dt, solving the resulting equation, and 273 noting that dI/dt = 0 when S(t)/S o = γ/β at I max to yield .
