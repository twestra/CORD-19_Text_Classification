1 inflammatory storm incited by monocyte centric immune interactions 2 revealed by single-cell analysis 3 4
network with Tocilizumab treatment at single cell resolution has not been uncovered. As of Apr 1, 2020, WHO reported 40,598 deaths out of 823,626 confirmed cases 67 infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and these 68 numbers are still growing rapidly 1 . Approximately 14% of patients with COVID-19 69 experienced severe disease, and 5% were critically ill suffered from 49% fatality rate 2 , 70 which may be caused by patients' abnormal immune system activation 3,4,6 . Hence, there 71
is an urgent need for researchers to understand how the immune system respond to the 72 viral infections at severe stage and thereby provide effective treatment strategies. 73
Studies have shown that the inflammatory storm caused by excessive immune 74 responses was associated with the crucial cause for mortality in COVID-19 7,8 . Plasma 75 concentrations of a series of inflammatory cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage 76 colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6 4 , tumor necrosis factor α 77 (TNF-α), IL-2, 7, 10 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 9 were 78 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further investigation demonstrated peripheral 79 inflammatory monocytes and pathogenic T cells may incite cytokine storm in severe 80 COVID-19 patients 4,7 . To calming inflammatory storm, Tocilizumab, which targeting 81 IL-6 receptors and has proved its effectiveness in the treatment of cytokine release 82 syndrome that is severe or life-threatening 10,11 , was used in the treatment of severe 83 COVID-19. After receiving Tocilizumab, the body temperature of the patients returned 84 to normal after 24 hours. The concentration of oxygen inhalation was significantly 85 decreased on the 5 th day 5 . However, the immune network arousing the inflammatory 86 storm in severe or recovery stage during Tocilizumab therapy at single cell level has 87 not been uncovered. 88
Here, we profiled the peripheral immune cells of COVID-19 patients using single-89 cell transcriptome sequencing. We obtained 5 peripheral blood samples from 2 severe 90 COVID-19 patients at 3 consecutive time-points from the severe to recovery stages 91 during Tocilizumab treatment (Fig. 1a) . Specifically, the blood samples at severe stage 92 were collected within 12 hours of Tocilizumab was given. The blood samples at 93 recovery stage were collected at the 5 th and 7 th day after Tocilizumab treatment. The 94 this monocyte subpopulation was suppressed after the Tocilizumab treatment. 151
Next, we explored the transcription factors (TFs) that may be involved in the 152 regulation of inflammatory storm in monocytes. We used SCENIC 15 and predicted 15 153
TFs that may regulate genes which were enriched in severe stage-specific monocyte 154 (Fig 2g) . By constructing a gene regulatory network, we found 3 of them, namely ETS2, 155 NFIL3 and PHLDA2 were regulating the cytokine storm relevant genes (Extended Data 156 Fig.2d ). In addition, we found the expressions of ETS2, NFIL3 and PHLDA2 and their 157 target genes were enhanced in severe-specific monocyte subpopulation (Fig 2h) , 158 suggesting these 3 TFs may regulate the inflammatory storm in monocytes. 159
Given that monocytes in the severe stage may be involved in the regulation of a 160 variety of immune cell types, we used the accumulated ligand/receptor interaction 161 database 16 CellPhoneDB (www.cellphonedb.org) to identify alterations of molecular 162
interactions between monocytes and all the immune cell subsets (Supplementary Table  163 6). We found 15 pairs of cytokines and their receptors whose interaction were 164 significantly altered in severe versus recovery and healthy stages (Fig 3a) . Consistent 165 with previous study 4 , we found monocytes interacted with CD4 + T cells and plasma B 166 cells in patients at severe stage through the ligand/receptor pairs of IL-6/IL-6R. This 167 interaction, together with many other cytokine storm relevant cell-cell communications 168
were then extensively attenuated after the treatment of Tocilizumab (Fig 3b) , suggesting 169 that this drug may functioning by effectively blocking the inflammatory storm in severe 170
In addition, we also discovered many other ligand/receptor pairs involved in a 172 broader spectrum of immune cell communications enriched at the severe stage. For 173 example, TNF-α and its receptors, which connected monocytes with many other 174 immune cells. Others like IL-1β and its receptor, which connected monocytes with 175 CD8 + T cells. Chemokines, such as CCL4L2, CCL3 and CCL4 and their receptors were 176 also found enriched at severe stage. These cytokines and their receptors may serve as 177 potential drug targets to treat COVID-19 patients at severe stage, and some of their 178 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Collectively, these findings illustrated the molecular basis of 180 cell-cell interactions at the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, leading to a better 181 understanding of the mechanisms of inflammatory storm of the disease. 182
Robust multi-factorial immune responses can be elicited against viral infection, 183 such as avian H7N9 disease 17,18 . A recent report has found effective immune responses 184 from a non-severe COVID-19 patient 19 . However, it is not clear whether the anti-virus 185 immune response would be affected after Tocilizumab treatment. Therefore, the anti-186 virus immune responses from the humoral and cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 187 patients at severe stage were compared with recovery stage and healthy controls. As 188 expected, we found plasma B cells were barely existing in healthy controls (Fig. 4a) . and a subset of CD8 + T cells with proliferation characteristics (cluster 12) (Fig. 4c, d) . 198
Among them, the cells from the severe patients were mainly distributed in the effector 199 CD8 + T cell cluster (Fig. 4c, d) . We then conducted pairwise comparisons to identify 200
DEGs of CD8 + T cells between the severe, recovery and healthy stages ( Table 9 ; P < 10 -10 ). 203
Meanwhile, genes involved in "leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity" and "positive 204 regulation of cytokine production" were highly enriched in CD8 + T cells from COVID-205 19 patients at both severe and recovery stage (Fig. 4g, Supplementary Table 9 ; P < 10 -206 author/funder.

We further detected elevated expression of the 108 and 449 genes involved in these 207 GO terms (Fig. 4h , i, Supplementary Table 10) . Together, these results demonstrated 208 the critical evidence that robust adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 209 infection exist in severe stage and remain after Tocilizumab treatment. 210 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.029769 doi: bioRxiv preprint
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from two severe COVID-19 patients. The We generated single-cell transcriptome library following the instructions of single-cell 260 3' solution v2 reagent kit (10x Genomics). Briefly, after thawing, washing and counting 261 cells, we loaded the cell suspensions onto a chromium single-cell chip along with 262 partitioning oil, reverse transcription (RT) reagents, and a collection of gel beads that 263 author/funder.

After generation of single-cell gel bead-in-264 emulsions (GEMs), RT was performed using a C1000 Touch TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-265 Rad). The amplified cDNA was purified with SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). 266
Single-cell libraries were then constructed following fragmentation, end repair, polyA-267 tailing, adaptor ligation, and size selection based on the manufacturer's standard 268 parameters. Each sequencing library was generated with unique sample index. Libraries 269 were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. the accession number will be available upon request. We also used the scRNA-seq data 278 of PBMCs from 2 healthy donors, which can be downloaded from the 10X genomics 279 official website. Firstly, we filtered low quality cells using Seurat 13 (version 3.1.4). For 280 cells from COVID-19 patients (PZ and PW), we retained cells with detected gene 281 numbers between 500 and 6,000 and mitochondrial UMIs less than 10%. For cells from 282 healthy donors, we retained cells with detected gene numbers between 300 and 5,000 283 and mitochondrial UMIs less than 10%. Subsequently we normalized gene counts for 284 each cell using the "NormalizeData" function of Seurat with default parameters. 285
In downstream data processing, we used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and 286 the top 40 canonical components to find the "anchor" cells between patients and healthy 287 controls. We then used the "IntegrateData" function in Seurat to integrate all the cells. 288
We clustered cells based on the integrated dataset using Seurat with parameter 289 "resolution=0.3" and generated 20 clusters. To display cells in a 2-dimensional space, 290
we ran the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated dataset and adopted 291 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To search for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we first assign the negative 296 elements in the integrated expression matrix to zero. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test 297
to search for the DEGs between each pair of the 3 stages of cells (i.e. severe stage, 298 recovery stage and healthy control). We applied multiple thresholds to screen for DEGs, 299
including mean fold-change >2, P value <0.001, and were detected in >10% of cells in 300 at least one stage. We adopted SCENIC 15 (version 1.1.2) and RcisTarget database to build the gene 312 regulatory network of CD14 + monocytes. Since the number of CD14 + monocytes from 313 healthy control (N = 9,618) was more than those from the severe and recovery stages 314 (N = 1,607), to balance their contributions in the motif analysis, we randomly sampled 315 2,000 CD14 + monocytes from the healthy control for calculation. We selected 13,344 316 genes that were detected in at least 100 monocytes or included in the DEGs of the 3 317 stages as the input features for SCENIC. With default parameters, SCENIC generated 318 the enrichment scores of 427 motifs. We used the student's t-test to calculate the P 319 author/funder. All rights reserved.
