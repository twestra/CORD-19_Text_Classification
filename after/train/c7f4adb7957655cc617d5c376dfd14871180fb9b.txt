The SARS-CoV-2 driven disease, COVID-19, is presently a pandemic with increasing human 20 and monetary costs. COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on 21 healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. In order to launch both containment 22
and mitigation measures, each country requires accurate estimates of COVID-19 incidence as 23 such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and design control 24
strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based 25 mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory COVID-19. We have analyzed 26
incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, 27
and India, and show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country 28
with high accuracy. We show that R0 as the basic reproduction number exhibits significant 29 spatial and temporal variation in these countries. However, by including a new function for 30 temporal variation of R0 in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides highly reliable 31 estimates of asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19

Introduction 36
Since the first reports from China 1-3 , COVID-19 has spread to all the continents resulting in 37 the infection of more than 1.5 million people and a death toll of more than 100,000 4,5 . Due to 38 the severity of the pandemic, many countries have implemented complete or partial 39 lockdowns and international travel restrictions 6-8 to stem disease transmission 9,10 . As the 40 COVID-19 pandemic presents a very dire economic and humanitarian scenario for most 41 countries worldwide, it is imperative that afflicted governments have ready access to highly 42 reliable estimates of COVID-19 spread across their states and regions. Such predictive 43 incidence data will enable deployment of resource allocation strategies, development of new 44 socio-economic policies and upgradation of healthcare facilities so as to minimize 45 detrimental effects in each country 7, 8, 11 . 46 47
Several studies have modeled the COVID-19 pandemic at the city, state, or country level 6,8,12-48 14 using the common Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model 15 that can 49 capture the dynamics of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. In this model, the 50 population is divided into four categories of which "susceptible" individuals may become 51
"exposed" to the virus through "infected" people who will eventually be "removed" (that is, 52 they can no longer infect others). Removed population refers to the individuals who have 53 recovered or died. The traditional SEIR model when applied to model COVID-19, however, 54
suffers from the following two major limitations: (i) it assumes homogeneity in a large 55 population via keeping the basic reproduction number R0 a constant (i.e., local variations in 56 the transmission dynamics within a large population are not accounted for) 15-17 , and (ii) it 57 assumes a "closed population" without demographic variation stemming from births, deaths 58 or migration 15 . 59 60
China reported its first case on 31 December 2019, with a peak in cumulative cases in an 61 eight-week interval and thence a plateauing. Italy followed the same trajectory after ~11 62 weeks and then the USA after ~13 weeks (of the first case in China spatio-temporal variations of R0 in Italy, USA and India (see Figure 1 ). Specifically, we 86
tracked COVID-19 spread in each state/region within these countries and then computed R0 87 by explicitly solving the SEIR equations. Interestingly, we observed that R0 exhibited 88 significant spatial and temporal variations (see Figure 1 ), and hence it was deemed 89 inappropriate to be used as a constant for any large population.
To address the granularity in R0, we developed a new adaptive, interacting, cluster-based 92 SEIR (AICSEIR) model that, we show, can capture the transmission dynamics of the 93 COVID-19 pandemic within a heterogeneous population to high accuracy ( Figure 2 ). 94
Hereon, the term state represents a subpopulation (or a cluster) in a country. State, therefore, 95
corresponds to the geo-administrative boundaries within India and the USA, and regions in 96
Italy. Our new model divided any given country's entire population into multiple, interacting 97 clusters that mingled stochastically. This enabled us to predict the trajectories of COVID-19 98 transmission in three heterogeneous populations of Italy, USA, and India up to the 99 state/region level. Typically, R0 is estimated by fitting an exponential curve in the early 100 .

will lead to a significant underestimation of R0 due to the removed population (as it is not 107
accounted for in the exponential model). To address these caveats, we computed R0 by 108
optimizing predictions from the SEIR model for each state within a country as a function of 109 time (see Methods). This new approach is able to capture the time dynamics of R0 that 110 emanate as a result of public health interventions in a given country. In particular, we 111
decided to re-estimate R0 on a fortnightly interval in order to capture its variability.
Methodology
The datasets used for the study include the following. In the above equations, ** , ** , ** , ** , ** , ** denote the number of susceptible, infected, 137 exposed, total hosts, births, and deaths, respectively, in a subpopulation (cluster) 'i' that live 138 in subpopulation 'i' and *+ , *+ , *+ , *+ , *+ , *+ denote the number of susceptible, infected, 139 exposed, total hosts, births, and deaths in subpopulation 'i' that live in subpopulation 'j', 140 .

In this study, it is assumed that the number of births and deaths compared to the 141 number of susceptible, infected, exposed, total hosts are negligibly small for the time-period 142 considered and therefore set to zero.
The parameter is called the removal or recovery rate, defined as the reciprocal of the 145 average infectious period. In this study, the average infectious period is considered to be 146 three days. * ( ) the parameter indicates the cluster-wise spread of the disease as a function 147 of time. * ( )is evaluated as * ( ) = *, ( ) where *, ( ) is the time-varying basic 148
reproductive ratio, a key measure that governs the spread of the epidemic. parameter is the 149 inverse of the average latent period or average incubation period. In this study, the average 150 incubation period is assumed to be seven days 8,30 . 151 152
The variable *+ measures the rate at which individuals leave their home population 'j' and to 153
subpopulation 'i', and *+ measures the rate at which individuals leave the subpopulation 'i' 154
and to their home population 'j'. We have assumed that during the onset of an epidemic, any 155
individual in the home population would choose to stay there and a fraction of the individuals 156 that live in population 'i', may return to their home population 'j'. Therefore, we have 157 considered *+ to be zero in the model, while *+ is modeled as a stochastic parameter. To this 158 extent, we have assumed that the fraction of the home going migrant population from each 159 subpopulation 'j' per day will be capped to a fraction 'frac' of the subpopulation. Hence, the 160 matrix is generated as a × matrix, where denotes the total number of states in a 161 country, with each element *+ is sampled from *+ ∼ [0, ], where is the Uniform 162 distribution, with a restriction of S *+ T = . In the study, without loss of generality, 163
frac is set to be 0.10.
Once *+ is frozen, the next step is to calculate ** and *+ . This involves the allocation of the 166 home going migrant population from a native subpopulation to ( − 1) other native 167
subpopulations. To this extent, we have assumed that the home of the migrant population is 168 distributed to ( − 1) other subpopulations in a ratio directly proportional to the population 169 of the receiver state and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Further, for 170 simplicity, we assume the state capitals are the point of entry and exit points of the migrant 171
population. If we denote * be the total population of state , then ** = (1 − ** ) * and *+ = 172
where a /0 is the fraction of the population of the receiver state normalized 173 with the population of remaining ( − 1) states and b /0 is the fraction distance between 174 capital cities from the feeder state's capital normalized with distance to the capital cities of 175 the remaining ( − 1) states.
The infected population matrix is initialized with ** is equal to the actual number of cases 178
reported in the state at the start of the simulation day and *+ set to zero for all the states. 179
Also, the exposed population matrix is initialized identically to that of the infected 180 population matrix to start the simulation. Further, we add an inter-cluster restriction 181
parameter to tune effect of restrictions imposed, as the result of various interventions 182 enforced by the state/central administrations, on the mobility of the migrant population from 183 feeder state to receiver state with C = 0 representing zero mobility, and C = 1 representing 184 restriction-free mobility.

To validate our approach, we used the SEIR model to fit actual COVID-19 incidence data for 219
Lombardia of Italy (Figure 1(a) , see Methods), and then computed its R0 values 4,24-29 . The 220 high R 2 value associated with the fit suggests that the derived R0 values are reliable for the 221 time-period considered (Figure 1(a) and Supplementary Material). We then proceeded to do 222 this for all the 30 states within India, 45 within the USA and 20 regions of Italy ( Figures  223  1(b)-(e) ). While in few cases, the R 2 fits were poor due to low initial infection load, most 224 states in the three countries produced highly reliable R0 values (Figures 1(c) -(e) and 225
Supplementary Material). It was noted that states with high incidence returned very robust R 2 226
values and thus, we considered all R0 values with R 2 > 0.8. For the few other states, R0 was 227 assumed to be the country average. Such analyses resulted in a dynamic R0 profile for each of 228 the three countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak (Figure 1(b) ). Interestingly, 229
we observed that for both Italy and the USA, the R0 values exhibited significantly broader 230 distribution ranging from ~2-14 and ~4-12, respectively (detailed state-wise plots for 231 estimating R0 along with the exact R0 scores are provided as Supplementary Material). On the 232 contrary, in the case of India, we observed that R0 values ranged from ~ 2-6 ( Figure 1(b) ).
This evident variation in the ranges of R0 values is in congruence with the observed slower 234 rate of early COVID-19 spread in India when compared to the USA and Italy despite the fact 235 that all three countries reported their first COVID-19 case at the end of January 2020.
We next analyzed the temporal variations in R0 as it is significantly altered due to many 238 factors, including travel restrictions, state-wise lockdowns (as in part of USA) and 239
countrywide lockdown (as for Italy and India). We, therefore, calculated R0 for Italy prior to 240 lockdown (that is before 9 March 2020), two weeks into lockdown and four weeks into 241 lockdown (Figure 1(c) ). For the USA, we estimated R0 with a two-week interval period 242 (Figure 1(d) ). Moreover, in the case of India, due to the delayed onset of the spread of 243 disease, we computed a single R0 (Figure 1(e) ). These data provide the R0 landscape as a 244
choropleth map for each country (Figure 1 (c)-(e). As is evident, the R0 for Italy decreased 245 significantly due to its lockdown routines (Figure 1(c) ). Indeed, enforcement of stricter 246 mobility restrictions has reduced Italian R0 values closer to unity thereby controlling the 247 growth of the epidemic (Figure 1(c) ). For the USA, it is clear that only the states that 248
implemented substantial restrictions have managed to reduce their R0 values (Figure 1(d) ). 249
For India, the strict screening of incoming international travelers and early imposition of 250 lockdown resulted in reduced R0 values in comparison to Italy and the USA. These analyses 251 therefore immediately reveal the benefits of public health interventions, and such modeling 252 approaches may be used widely and routinely for assessment of intervention outcomes.

predict COVID-19 spread in Italy, the USA, and India. For this, our model required total state 286 population, values of distance between the capital cities of two-states, initial infected number 287
(it could be zero) and the temporal variations in R0 (as estimated in the previous section, see 288
Methods). The total population of any state was divided into native and migrant categories 289 (latter was set to 10%). It was assumed that the distribution of a state's migrants was directly 290
proportional to the population of the home state and was inversely proportional to the inter-291

Therefore, two implicit assumptions in these analyses are: (a) people are 292 prone to migration from a highly populated state, and (b) the likelihood of choosing a nearby 293 state for migration is higher. Further, indirect measures of migration, such as airline/train/bus 294 data and the number of tourists, were ignored.
We then compared directly the trajectories of infection prevalence in Italy, the USA, and 297
India using both the traditional SEIR model (represented as single in Figure. 2(a)-(c)) and 298 our new AICSEIR model (Figure 2(a)-(c) ). A new parameter C was introduced wherein 299 values of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 represent the inter-cluster interaction restrictions (C of 0 and 1 300 denote the absence of migration versus free migration, see Methods for details). All presented 301 models were run extensively with multiple random seed values to account for the stochastic 302 parameter *+ that models migration as a random event (see Methods). Using this, a direct 303 comparison of the predictive robustness of SEIR and AICSEIR models in the context of true 304
incidence in the three countries is possible (Figure 2(a)-(c) ). We observed SEIR significantly 305
overestimates the peak-infected population (five-fold for Italy and up to 1.8 fold the USA and 306
India). In contrast, the AICSEIR provided a significantly closer estimation of infected cases 307 (Figure 2 (a)-(c)). Thus, our approach was able to recapitulate the epidemiological trends both 308
qualitatively and quantitatively not only on a countrywide scale but also for its constituent 309
states/regions.
It is noteworthy that the model provides a prediction for total infected, but the observations 312 are based on clinically detected cases. Therefore, both these estimates suffer from the 313 following deficiencies. The clinically detected cases will always underestimate the number of Pradesh (India) with non-zero initial infections. It is noteworthy that in both scenarios, our 342 model is able to predict the observed trends to high statistical reliability.
Another facet of our AICSEIR model is its ability to predict the evolution of the infection in 345
state-wise or in clusters. Indeed, the country-wise predictions were computed as the 346 summation of sub-populations (state-wise). To validate further, we selected two states from 347 each country and mapped their COVID-19 burden (Figure 3 ). The initial, exposed, infected, 348
and removed populations of Calabria and Veneto (Italy), Idaho and Washington (USA), 349
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (India) were assessed (Figure 3 ). Note that for each 350 country, at least one state chosen had zero initial infected population. For the initiation of 351 infection in these virgin territories, the importation of infected persons would be required 352 based on the cluster interaction term C (C = 0 would maintain zero infection .

These fluctuations in R0 need to be 368 incorporated in the development of robust and realistic epidemiological models. We show the 369 utility of the SEIR model for estimating R0 wherein a simple exponential fit may, in the best 370 case, lead to over-/under estimation of R0, and in the worst case, may simply be not valid due 371
to the non-linear variations in disease spread. We propose that temporal variations in R0 372
should be included in an adaptive fashion, while the spatial variations should be included in a 373 granular, cluster-wise model. This approach is capable of capturing realistic infection 374 dynamics across each nation or indeed worldwide. AICSEIR with its tunable interaction 375 parameters, can indeed be applied to other infectious diseases. 376 377
There are several outcomes of immediate public health value from our work: (i) we provide 378
robust estimates of infection burden with timelines and this will facilitate proactive 379 development of resource allocation strategies locally 33,34 , (ii) our model provides a caution 380
for regions with low caseload presently as they are likely to follow trends of other highly 381 affected areas in the absence of substantial mobility restrictions, (iii) we suggest a locally 382
graded contextual interventional responses that can factor socio-economic factors and 383 morbidity (note that complete longer-term lockdowns will have notable detrimental economic 384
fallouts resulting in exaggerated impacts on society), (iv) our revised novel coronavirus 385 burden estimates will help map the true extent of infection that includes undetected cases and 386 asymptomatic infections. Although epidemic prediction models tend to discount pivotal 387 contributions from the host and environmental confounders 35,36 , two useful extrapolations of 388 our model are to assess case volumes that may require intensive care and to calculate the true 389 case fatality rates (CFR) 37,38 . The AICSEIR model can thus serve as a valuable tool for 390 strategizing containment and for stemming mortality associated with the COVID-19 391 pandemic. 392 .
