As the distance between humans and wild animal habitats diminishes due to uncontrolled 67 human expansion, a series of zoonotic diseases with high mortality rates have emerged. For 68 instance, the recent outbreak of Ebola in Africa, which killed over 5,000 people, was most 69 likely spread from bats and primates to humans 1 . The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 70 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 71 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 is not the only example of coronaviruses that have recently passed from 72 animals to humans. Coronaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that typically cause respiratory 73 tract infections in humans, yet they are frequently in the reservoir of wild animals with no 74 disease 3 . For example, the common cold is often (10-15%) caused by a coronavirus (e.g. HCoV-75 229E and HCoV-OC43) 4 . However, coronaviruses can also lead to severe and life-threatening 76 diseases. In the early 2000s a coronavirus called SARS-CoV, believed to be passed from bats 77 to humans in South East Asia, caused more than 700 deaths from around 8,000 confirmed 78 cases worldwide 5 . Since 2012, another zoonotic coronavirus believed to have passed from 79 camels to humans in the Middle East was designated as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 80 (MERS) 6 . To date, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of MERS with over 800 deaths. 81
While SARS appears to have been eradicated, MERS cases are sporadic and human to human 82 spread is limited 4 . 83
As of 21 st April 2020, COVID-19 2 has become a global pandemic with more than 84 ~2,500,000 confirmed cases and over 170,000 deaths. Due to its high infectivity rate and the 85 high level of intensive care that many patients need, COVID-19 has overwhelmed national 86 health services and destabilized the world. One important reason is that many people who 87 are positive for the virus show mild symptoms 7, 8 , leading to unnoticed spread of the virus. 88
The current worldwide emergency, possibility of continued expansion to less developed 89 countries, risk of virus mutations and the perpetuation beyond this season has made it 90 imperative to stop the trajectory of virus spreading. Developing drugs and preventative 91 vaccines are ongoing but to warrant success it is necessary to have more knowledge about 92 the disease mechanisms. So far, little is known except for the viral binding via angiotensin 93 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and subsequent priming by type 2 transmembrane serine 94 protease 2 (TMPRSS2) protease, which are shared mechanisms with SARS and MERS 9, 10 . To 95 test experimental treatments, animal models close to humans are necessary due to sequence 96 5 variation of ACE2 and changes in the proportions of cell subtypes in organs between species. 97 For these reasons, it is essential to have a species close to human to study . In this 98 regard, monkey experiments have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 produces clinical 99 manifestations similar to COVID-19 patients 11 . Another study demonstrated that infection 100 with SARS-CoV-2 in monkeys is preventable by acquired immunity, answering one of the 101 outstanding questions about the disease 12 . 102
Issues about the proportions of cell types within organs between species and their 103 crosstalk can be addressed effectively through single-cell profiling technologies, in particular 104 single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase accessible 105 chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq). Yet, although human data are accumulating 13 , monkey 106 data are still scarce. The comparison between human and monkey data will be crucial for 107 advancing our knowledge of COVID-19. Here, we provide a high-resolution single-cell atlas of 108 nine organs/tissues (lung, kidney, pancreas, brain, parotid, liver, thyroid, aorta artery, and 109 blood) in monkey, encompassing 215,334 cells. By comparing the expression of SARS related 110 targets in monkey and human, we have identified cell-to-cell similarities as expected. 111
Crucially, we also discovered stark differences in ACE2 expression between these two species, 112 for example in the ciliated vs pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells of the lung and hepatocytes in 113 liver. We also observed that ACE2 is heterogeneous among different epithelial cell subtypes 114 across these organs/tissues, suggesting that variations in cell state could influence viral entry. 115
Supporting this, single-cell ATAC-seq of monkey kidney identified regulatory elements driven 116 by signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 and 3 (STAT1 and 3) and interferon 117 regulatory factor 1 (IRF) in the ACE2 locus. This suggests that cytokines, particularly 118 interleukin 6 (IL6), aiming to induce a tissue protective response can exacerbate the disease 119 by aiding viral entry into target cells. Additionally, through correlation analysis with ACE2 120 expression, we have identified several potential candidates involved in COVID-19 121 pathophysiology, such as Transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27), Indoleamine 2,3-122 dioxygenase 2 (IDO2), DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C12 (DNAJC12) and 123
Alanyl aminopeptidase N (ANPEP). These targets may offer therapeutic opportunities. 124
Taken together, our data constitute a unique resource which could aid the scientific 125 community in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. From a wider perspective, this will also be 126 instrumental for systematic comparative studies aimed at understanding physiological and 127 pathophysiological differences between monkey and other species, in particular, human. 128 7 cluster 13, pancreatic acinar cells in cluster 26 and parotid acinar cells in cluster 30 (Fig. 1c,  161 Extended Data Fig. 1c) . We next performed clustering and differential gene expression 162 analysis to dissect the cellular composition of each individual organ. These analyses confirmed 163 the typical patterns of cell heterogeneity for all the organs/tissues. When examining the lung 164 tissue, we defined 10 major clusters with specific molecular markers, including ciliated cells, 165 macrophages, cycling macrophages, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, pulmonary 166 alveolar (pneumocytes) type 1 and type 2, endothelial and club cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a) . 167
The kidney consisted of 11 clusters, those being podocytes, thick ascending limb cells, Fig. 2h) . Finally, our data 186 showed the largest population of the pancreas to be acinar cells, while smaller clusters were 187 comprised of stromal, ductal, and islet cells (alpha and beta), together with a population that 188 could not be assigned to any known cell type (Extended Data Fig. 2i) . 189
In conclusion, we have successfully profiled the transcriptome of nine organs at single-190 cell resolution in monkey, which could assist in the study of 192 .

Recent studies have reported that, similarly to SARS-CoV, the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 virus to 194 infect host cells relies on viral spike (S) protein binding to ACE2 entry receptor 9, 10 , which is 195 involved in the control of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system 19 . This 196 phenomenon is primed by the multifunction serine protease TMPRSS2 20 . Accordingly, double 197 positive (ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + ) cells have higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Although 198 immunohistological studies have demonstrated localization of these two proteins in the 199 respiratory tract 21 , it is unclear which cell subtypes express these genes and how homogenous 200 the expression among a specific cell subtype is. Also, comprehensive information about other 201 cell types and organs that express these two proteins and could be targeted by the virus in 202 human or monkey is lacking. 203
We inspected our data to see how widespread and homogenous ACE2 expression was 204 in the monkey tissues. As expected, ACE2 was detected in several lung clusters, mainly ciliated 205 cells, club cells and pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells (Fig. 2a, 2d, 3a upper panel) , whereas in 206 the kidney, ACE2 was primarily present in proximal tubule cells (Fig. 2a, 2d, 3b upper panel) . 207
The latter is consistent with reports describing that a significant number of COVID-19 patients 208 display altered kidney function 15, 22 . Interestingly, ACE2 expression was heterogenous among 209 these cell subtypes in both lung and kidney. In the liver, ACE2 was mostly expressed in 210 cholangiocytes, with a smaller degree of expression also found in hepatocytes (Fig. 2a, 2d, 3c  211 upper panel). Notably, the closely related SARS-CoV caused liver injury due to hepatitis in 212 some patients 23 , suggesting that the liver may also be a direct target for SARS-CoV-2. A small 213 proportion of ACE2 + was also observed in pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 2a, 2d , Extended Data Fig.  214 3a). In contrast, little or no expression was observed in thyroid, neocortex, parotid and PBMC 215 ( Fig. 2a, 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3a) . Negligible ACE2 expression in the neocortex suggests that 216 other tissues may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 that cause loss of taste and smell, regarding the 217 latter in particular the olfactory epithelium. 218 TMPRSS2 displayed more broadly expressed across cell types in multiple tissues, 219
although it was highest in kidney cells. However, in contrast to ACE2, its expression was 220 highest in the distal convoluted tubule, thin limb, intercalated and principal cell 1 and 2 kidney 221 clusters (Fig. 2b, 2d, 3b lower panel, Extended Data Fig. 3b) . Additionally, significant 222 TMPRSS2 was observed in both parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, thyroid follicular cells, 223 cholangiocytes and in several lung clusters (Fig. 2b, 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3) . We then 224 9 determined which cells co-expressed both genes (ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + ). Notably, the largest 225 overlap between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in the ciliated and club cell clusters of the 226 lung and to a lesser extent the proximal tubule cells of the kidney (Fig. 2c, 2e) . A smaller 227 overlap was also observed in cholangiocytes and in pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 2c, 2e) . 228 Therefore, our data show that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in a variety of cell 229 types, mainly epithelial cells, within the nine monkey organs/tissues (Supplementary Table  230 2a). The observed heterogeneity of ACE2 in these cell subtypes also suggests that variations Given the heterogeneous nature of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression within monkey tissues, we 237 decided to investigate similarities and differences between human and monkey. For this 238 purpose, we retrieved publicly available data from single-cell studies in human (see methods). 239 TMPRSS2 distribution was similar in cell subtypes of lung, kidney and liver between human 240 and monkey ( Fig. 3d-3f) . However, strikingly, ACE2 showed distinct patterns among cell 241 subtypes in all three organs between the two species ( Fig. 3d-3f) . The biggest differences 242 were observed in ciliated cells of the lung, which had the highest expression of ACE2 in 243 monkey, and pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells, which had the highest expression of ACE2 in 244 human. The function of ciliated cells is to move substances (e.g. cell debris and toxic material) 245 across the surface of the respiratory tract and are commonly targeted by respiratory viruses, 246 whereas pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells have regenerative properties, are crucial for alveolar 247 homeostasis and produce surfactant 24, 25 . In the kidney of both monkey and human, the 248 highest ACE2 expression was in proximal tubule cells (Fig. 3e) , which are responsible for 249 electrolyte and nutrient reabsorption. However, renal endothelial cells had higher expression 250 in monkey compared to human. In liver, cholangiocytes had similarly high ACE2 expression in 251 monkey and human, but hepatocytes showed higher expression and more positive cells in the 252 human (Fig. 3f) . Considering the heterogenous expression of ACE2 within the proximal tubule 253 cells in monkey, we revisited the previously analyzed data and were able to sub cluster this 254 population of cells into two (S1 and S3) based on the expression of SLC5A2 and SLC7A13 26 255 (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2b ). These two genes are sodium and glucose 256 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We did not include thyroid, 257 pancreas or aorta in these analyses because of lack of high-quality available human single-cell 258 datasets. As for the neocortex and PBMC, they have little to no expression of ACE2 in human 259 (data not shown). 260
These differences in ACE2 expression across cell subtypes in the lung, kidney and liver 261 in monkey and human raise the possibility that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the two species 262 will have different effects. 263 264 ACE2 correlation analysis across cell types reveals potential therapeutic targets. 265
To shed light on potential mechanisms that could facilitate ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 266 infection, we performed an analysis of the Pearson's correlation coefficient, based on gene 267 expression in the 44 cell subtypes, to determine what genes are co-regulated with ACE2 in 268 monkey tissues. Correlated genes were considered as those displaying a coefficient higher 269 than 0.6 with an adjusted P value < 0.001. Using these criteria, we observed several genes 270 with marked correlation, including genes that belong to metabolic and developmental 271 pathways and genes involved in the cellular response to xenobiotic stimuli ( Fig. 4a, b) . The 272 highest correlation was observed for transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27, cor = 0.84), a 273 protein involved in trafficking amino acid transporters to the apical brush border of kidney 274 proximal tubules 29 . This is unsurprising considering that TMEM27 is an important paralog of 275 ACE2, and high expression was restricted to kidney cells. DnaJ heat shock protein family 276 (Hsp40) member C12 (DNAJC12, cor = 0.78), a gene with a role in immune response 277 processes 30 , had a distribution like TMEM27. Importantly, we also observed high correlation 278 with Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2, cor = 0.77), a gene with abundant expression in 279 kidney and liver cells that was also expressed in the lung and other organs. IDO2 functions 280 during the early phases of immune responses and promotes inflammatory autoimmunity 31, 281 32 . ANPEP, which encodes for alanyl aminopeptidase N, was also co-expressed with ACE2 in 282 kidney, liver and to a lesser extent in lung too (cor = 0.64), like IDO2 (Fig. 4c, d) . Interestingly, 283
ANPEP has also been shown to be participate in immune responses, virus receptor activity 284 and in mediating virus entry into host cells 33, 34 . 285
These data highlight potential therapeutic targets to help in the fight against SARS-286
CoV-2. Due to their potential co-regulation with ACE2, DNAJC12 and ANPEP it is also possible 287 that they modulate and/or are directly involved in viral entry. Alternatively, depletion of cells 288 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To understand whether epigenetic mechanisms underlie the heterogeneity of ACE2 294 expression in the kidney, as representative for other organs, we employed DNBelab C4 295 technology to perform high-throughput single-cell ATAC-seq (Fig. 5a) . After filtering, 6,353 296 nuclei were used for downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a , b, Supplementary Table  297 4). We integrated these data with the kidney transcriptomic data described in Fig. 1 and 298 proceeded to perform Louvain clustering to map all the different cell types within the dataset 299 ( Fig. 5b) . Consistent with the transcriptomic data, our epigenomic mapping identified thick 300 ascending limb cells and proximal tubule cells as the largest kidney clusters (Extended Data 301 ACE2 locus, with the highest signal detected in proximal tubule cells S1 and S3, which are also 305 the highest ACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 5d) . Our approach failed to detect significant signal 306 enrichment in the ACE2 locus in endothelial cells, possibly related to the low level of 307 expression (Fig. 5d) . Within the cells of the kidney we observed the highest percentage of 308 ACE2 + cells in the proximal tubule S3, with a lower percentage in the proximal tubule S1 and 309 endothelial cells (Fig. 5e) . Motif analysis within the open chromatin regions in ACE2 + cells 310 demonstrated that these regions were preferentially enriched in STAT1 and 3 and IRF1 311 binding sites (Fig. 5f) . These findings suggested that tissue protective cytokines including IL5, 312 IL6, EGF and interferons are acting on these proximal tubule cells S3 to induce ACE2. We 313 focused on IL6 because a recent clinical trial has been started that uses anti-IL6 receptor (IL6R) 314 antibodies in the treatment of COVID-19 315 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=49409). IL6 is a potent regulator of 316 immune responses and can be produced by a variety of interstitial cells including fibroblasts, 317 endothelial cells and more importantly tissue macrophages 36 . Interestingly, we also noticed 318 that distribution of IL6R correlated well with ACE2 in proximal tubule cells (Fig. 5g, Extended  319 Data Fig. 5d) . In human kidney a similar co-expression pattern was detected (Fig. 5h) . 320 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Our observations suggest a potential positive feedback loop between IL6 and ACE2 321 expression that can exacerbate COVID-19 disease progression due to increased viral entry and 322 dissemination. In this study, we have generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of nine organs (liver, 337 kidney, lung, pancreas, neocortex, aorta, parotic gland, thyroid and peripheral blood) from 338 cynomolgus monkey. We used this dataset not only to provide fundamental information 339 about the cellular composition of the different tissues tested but also as a platform to dissect 340 the overall expression distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, and its serine 341 protease coactivator TMPRSS2 9, 10 . Interestingly, ACE2 was expressed in multiple epithelial 342 tissues besides the lung, especially the kidney and liver. Other organs of epithelial origin such 343 as the gut have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease 38 . A consequence of 344 this is that the SARS2-CoV-2 virus could infect these organs too, which would explain some of 345 the reported clinical manifestations of COVID-19 2 . By comparing our dataset with publicly 346 available human single-cell RNA-seq data, we have also uncovered significant differences in 347 cell subtypes expressing ACE2 between human and monkey. We showed different expression 348 patterns for ACE2 in the lung, where the highest levels were detected in ciliated cells in 349 monkey and pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells in human. Similarly, we observed marked 350 differences in liver, in which monkey hepatocytes displayed higher ACE2 and a larger number 351 of positive cells compared to the human. We do not know whether these differences will 352 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
