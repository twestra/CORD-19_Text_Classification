18 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently causing a pandemic. We show 19
that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the 20 closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in 21 biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences 22
between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2 23
(SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) 24 levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and 25 SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing 26 using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations 27 of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The 28 efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against 29 SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton 30 pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study 31 has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in 32 patients. 33 34
the protein, primarily in S and the papain-like protease (nsp3) (Supplementary Table  144 1). Based on our structural analysis, we propose that 45 DCPs are likely to result in 145 structural (or functional) differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
A further 222 could result in some change, with our analysis suggesting that the 147 remaining 258 DCPs seem unlikely to have a substantial effect on protein structure 148 and function. The most interesting changes were detected in the spike (S) protein, which 162 mediates coronavirus entry into host cells [Cui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b] . SARS-163
CoV-2 S is 77.46% sequence identical to the SARS-CoV S and most of the remaining 164
positions are DCPs (243 residues, 1%) (Table 1) . SARS-CoV entry depends on the 165 cleavage of S by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the endosomal 166 cysteine protease cathepsin L, and/ or other cellular proteases, with residues R667 167 and R797 being critical cleavage sites [ by the SARS-CoV-2 residue) ( Figure 1A ). There is greater conservation around the 176 R815 cleavage site with only two DCPs in close proximity (L792=S810, T795=S813) 177
( Figure 1A ). 178
The SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain (residues 306-527, equivalent to 179 328-550 in SARS-CoV-2) is enriched in DCPs, containing 51 DCPs (23% of residues). 180
Eleven of the 24 SARS-CoV S residues in direct contact with ACE2 were DCPs ( Figure  181 1A, Supplementary with SARS-CoV S. N439 in SARS-CoV-2 S is not present in the interface and the 191 sidechain points away from the interface ( Figure 1D ). Further, analysis of the SARS-192
CoV-2 S-ACE2 complex highlighted important roles of the V404=K417 DCP, where 193 K417 in SARS-CoV-2 S is able to form a salt bridge with ACE2 D30 ( Figure 1C ) [Yan 194 et al. levels and the cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV) ( Figure 3A ). 237 CL14 cells displayed lower ACE2 levels than both HT-29 and DLD-1 ( Figure 3A ), 238
although CL14 was, in contrast to HT-29 and DLD-1, permissive to SARS-CoV-2 (and 239 SARS-CoV) infection ( Figure 2 ). This suggests that there are other factors in addition 240
to the cellular ACE2 levels that determine cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and 241 SARS-CoV. 242 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024257 doi: bioRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2-and SARS-CoV-induced CPE formation in Caco2 cells ( Figure 4A ). 298
Camostat displayed nearly 14-fold increased activity against SARS-CoV-2 299 (concentration that inhibits CPE formation by 50%, IC50 1.20µM) compared to SARS-300
CoV (IC50 16.7µM) ( Figure 4A ). Nafamostat is an alternative serine protease inhibitor, 301 which is approved for pancreatitis and [Minakata et Nafamostat displayed higher activity against SARS-CoV-2 CPE formation (IC50 305 0.49µM) than camostat, but similar activity against SARS-CoV (18.9µM) ( Figure 4A ). 306
Therapeutic plasma levels for both compounds were described to reach about 0.2µM 307 [Hiraku et al., 1982; Cao et al., 2008] , which is below the antivirally active 308
concentrations. Moreover, although both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced 309 CPE formation, they displayed limited effects on the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle as 310 indicated by high levels of double-stranded RNA in both nafamostat-and camostat-311 treated SARS-CoV-2-infected cells ( Figure 4B ). Hence, both camostat and nafamostat 312 may primarily exert cytoprotective effects in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which inhibit 313 syncytium formation and cell lysis, but may not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the 314 same way. 315 aprotinin was also more effective against SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE formation (IC50 329 22.9 KIU/mL) than against SARS-CoV (IC50 118 KIU/mL) ( Figure 4A ). In addition and 330 in contrast to nafamostat and camostat, aprotinin also inhibited double-stranded RNA 331 formation in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells ( Figure 4B ). Therapeutic aprotinin plasma 332 levels were described to reach 147 ± 61 KIU/mL after the administration of 1,000,000 333
KIU Testing of additional antiviral drug candidates 341
To investigate whether there are also differences in the drug sensitivity profiles 342 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to other antiviral drug candidates, we tested two 343 further compounds ( Figure 4A) . Previous research had shown that 344 hydroxychloroquine and ammonium chloride interfere with SARS-CoV and SARS-345
CoV-2 replication, as lysosomotropic agents that increase the pH in lysosomes [Talbot 346 and inhibited both viruses in similar concentrations, and SARS-CoV was more sensitive to 358 remdesivir than to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4A ). Both omeprazole and remdesivir also 359 inhibited the formation of double-stranded RNA ( Figure 4B ) 360 361
Omeprazole
Omeprazole is a well-tolerated drug and a promising remdesivir with a fixed omeprazole concentration of 8µM, which resulted in further 369 increased activity against CPE formation (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold) 370
( Figure 5A ) and double-stranded RNA formation ( Figure 5B ). Hence, combinations of 371 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024257 doi: bioRxiv preprint
Here, we performed an in-silico analysis of the effects of differentially 382 conserved amino acid positions (DCPs) between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 383 proteins on virus protein structure and function in combination with a comparison of 384 wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in cell culture.
Our analysis identified 1243 DCPs, which represents 89% of the amino acid 386
positions that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and nearly 13% of all 387 residues encoded by the SARS-CoV genome. 258 of these DCPs (2.6% of all 388 residues) are likely to have a structural and functional impact. The DCPs are not 389 equally distributed between the proteins. DCPs are enriched in S, 3a, p6, nsp2, 390
papain-like protease, and nsp4, but very few DCPs are present in the envelope (E) 391
protein and most of the remaining non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1ab. This 392
indicates that the individual proteins differ in their tolerance to sequence changes and/ 393
or their exposure to selection pressure exerted by the host environment. 394
This large proportion of DCPs reflects the differences in the clinical behaviour 395
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The mortality associated with SARS-CoV is 396
substantially higher than that associated with SARS-CoV-2 (www.who.int) [ The serine protease inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, and aprotinin inhibited 428

This may indicate that camostat and nafamostat rather 431 exert cytoprotective effects that prevent cells from virus-induced lysis but less 432 pronounced antiviral activity. The mechanisms underlying the enhanced anti-SARS-433
CoV-2 activity of aprotinin remain unclear. Differences in the interference with 434 additional proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication may be responsible. Notably, 435
aprotinin had been identified in the past as a protease inhibitor with pronounced 436 antiviral activity, which may interfere with viral proteases in addition to cellular ones In conclusion, our in-silico study revealed a substantial number of differentially 455
conserved amino acid positions in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins. In 456 agreement, cell culture experiments identified differences in the cell tropism and drug 457 sensitivity profiles of these two viruses. Our data also show that cellular ACE2 levels 458
do not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Hence, ACE2 expression 459 studies are not sufficient to predict the SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism. Differences in the 460 drug sensitivity profiles between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the most closely 461 related coronavirus known to have caused disease in humans, indicate that 462 approaches to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs will require testing against this virus. 463
Finally, and probably most importantly during an ongoing pandemic, we have shown 464 that the approved drug aprotinin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinically achievable 465
concentrations. The efficacy of aprotinin (and of remdesivir, which is investigated 466
against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials) can be further enhanced by therapeutic 467
concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. Hence, our study has 468
identified novel candidate therapies based on approved drugs that can be readily 469 tested in a clinical setting.
