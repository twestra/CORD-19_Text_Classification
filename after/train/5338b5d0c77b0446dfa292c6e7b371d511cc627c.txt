The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 has created worldwide shortages of personal protective 10 equipment, in particular respiratory protection such as N95 respirators 1 . SARS-CoV-2 transmission is 11 frequently occurring in hospital settings, with numerous reported cases of nosocomial transmission 12 highlighting the vulnerability of healthcare workers 2-4 . In general, N95 respirators are designed for single 13 use prior to disposal. Several groups have addressed the potential for re-use of N95 respirators from a 14 mechanical or from a decontamination perspective (for a full literature overview see Supplementary   15 Appendix).
Here, we analyzed four different decontamination methods -UV radiation (260 -285 nm), 70ºC heat, 18 70% ethanol and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) -for their ability to reduce contamination with 19 infectious SARS-CoV-2 and their effect on N95 respirator function. For each of the decontamination 20 methods, we compared the inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filter fabric to that on stainless steel, 21 and we used quantitative fit testing to measure the filtration performance of the N95 respirators after each 22 decontamination run and 2 hours of wear, for three consecutive decontamination and wear sessions (see 23 Appendix). Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ethanol yielded extremely rapid inactivation both on N95 24 and on stainless steel ( Figure 1A ). UV inactivated SARS-CoV-2 rapidly from steel but more slowly on 25 N95 fabric, likely due its porous nature. Heat caused more rapid inactivation on N95 than on steel; 26 inactivation rates on N95 were comparable to UV.
Quantitative fit tests showed that the filtration performance of the N95 respirator was not markedly 29 reduced after a single decontamination for any of the four decontamination methods ( Figure 1B ).
Subsequent rounds of decontamination caused sharp drops in filtration performance of the ethanol-treated 31 masks, and to a slightly lesser degree, the heat-treated masks. The VHP-and UV-treated masks retained 32 comparable filtration performance to the control group after two rounds of decontamination, and 33 maintained acceptable performance after three rounds. 34 35 for use under a CC0 license. : medRxiv preprint Taken together, our findings show that VHP treatment exhibits the best combination of rapid inactivation 36 of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of N95 respirator integrity, under the experimental conditions used here 37 (Figure 1C). UV radiation kills the virus more slowly and preserves comparable respirator function. 70ºC 38 dry heat kills with similar speed and is likely to maintain acceptable fit scores for two rounds of 39 decontamination. Ethanol decontamination is not recommended due to loss of N95 integrity, echoing 40 earlier findings 5 . 41 42 All treatments, particularly UV and dry heat, should be conducted for long enough to ensure that a 43 sufficient reduction in virus concentration has been achieved. The degree of required reduction will 44 depend upon the degree of initial virus contamination. Policymakers can use our estimated decay rates 45 together with estimates of degree of real-world contamination to choose appropriate treatment durations 46 (see Appendix).
Our results indicate that N95 respirators can be decontaminated and re-used in times of shortage for up to 49 three times for UV and HPV, and up to two times for dry heat. However, utmost care should be given to 50 ensure the proper functioning of the N95 respirator after each decontamination using readily available 51 qualitative fit testing tools and to ensure that treatments are carried out for sufficient time to achieve 52 desired risk-reduction. 53 for use under a CC0 license. : medRxiv preprint 54 55 Figure 1. Decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 by four different methods. A) SARS-CoV-2 on N95 fabric 56 and stainless steel surface was exposed to UV, 70 ºC dry heat, 70% ethanol and vaporized hydrogen 57 peroxide (VHP). 50 µl of 10 5 TCID 50 /mL of SARS-CoV was applied on N95 and stainless steel (SS). 58 Samples were collected at indicted timepoints post exposure to the decontamination method for UV, heat 59 and ethanol and after 10 minutes for VHP. Viable virus titer is shown in TCID 50 /mL media on a 60 logarithmic scale. All samples were quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells. Plots show 61 estimated mean across three replicates (dots and bars show the posterior median estimate of this mean and 62 the posterior inter-quartile range, or IQR). Lines show predicted decay of virus titer over time (lines; 50 63 random draws per replicate from the joint posterior distribution of the exponential decay rate, i.e. negative 64 for use under a CC0 license. of the slope, and intercept, i.e. initial virus titer). Black dashed line shows maximum likelihood estimate 65 titer at the Limit of Detection (LOD) of the assay: 10 0.5 TCID 50 /mL media. B) Mask integrity. 66 Quantitative fit testing results for all the decontamination methods after decontamination and 2 hours of 67 wear, for three consecutive runs. Data from six individual replicates (small dots) for each treatment are 68 shown in addition to the predicted median and IQR (large dots and bars respectively) fit factor. Fit factors 69 are a measure of filtration performance: the ratio of the concentration of particles outside the mask to the 70 concentration inside. The measurement machine reports value up to 200. A minimal fit factor of 100 (red 71 dashed line) is required for a mask to pass a fit test. C) SARS-CoV-2 decontamination performance.

Short literature review:
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the necessity for large-scale decontamination procedures for 103 PPE, in particular N95 respirator masks 1 . SARS-CoV-2 has frequently been detected on PPE of 104 healthcare workers 2 . The environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need for rapid and 105 effective decontamination methods 3 . Extensive literature is available for decontamination procedures for 106 N95 respirators, using either bacterial spore inactivation tests, bacteria or respiratory viruses (e.g. 107 influenza A virus) 4-11 . Effective inactivation methods for these pathogens and surrogates include UV, 108 ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, gamma irradiation, ozone and dry heat 4,6,8,10-13 . The 109 filtration efficiency and N95 respirator fit has typically been less well explored, but suggest that both 110 filtration efficiency and N95 respirator fit can be affected by the decontamination method used 12,14 . It will 111 therefore be critical that FDA, CDC and OSHA guidelines with regards to fit testing, seal check and 112 respirator re-use are followed 4,15-18 . This article is a US Government work.

This is simply the 199 probability that a Poisson random variable with mean (-ln(2) × 10 x ) is greater than 0. Similarly, the 200 conditional probability of observing Y ijkdl = 0 given a true underlying titer log 10 titer v ijk is given by:
which is the probability that the Poisson random variable is 0.
This gives us our likelihood function, assuming independence of outcomes across wells. 
We model each replicate j for experimental condition i as starting with some true initial log 10 titer 218 v ij (0) = v ij0 . We assume that viruses in experimental condition i decay exponentially at a rate λ i over time t.
It follows that:

We use the direct-from-well data likelihood function described above, except that now instead of 222 estimating titer distribution about a shared mean µ ij we estimate λ i under the assumptions that our 223 observed well data Y ijkdl reflect the titers v ij (t).
Regression prior distributions
We place a weakly informative Normal prior distribution on the initial log 10 titers v ij0 to rule out 226 implausibly large or small values (e.g. in this case undetectable log 10 titers or log 10 titers much higher than 227 the deposited concentration), while allowing the data to determine estimates within plausible ranges:
228 v ij0 ~ Normal(4.5, 2) (10)
We placed a weakly informative Half-Normal prior on the exponential decay rates This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We label the control treatment i = 0. So we denote by F ijk the fit factor 243 for the j th mask from the i th treatment after k decontaminations (with k = 0 for the initial value).

That is, we calculate the probability of observing a value between Y + ijk and Yijk , given our parameters.
Decay model
We assumed that each mask had some true initial filtration rate p ij0 . We assumed that these were 263 logit-normally distributed about some unknown mean mask initial filtration rate p avg with a standard 264 deviation σ p , that is:
We then assumed that the logit of the filtration rate, logit(p ijk ), decreased after each decontamination 267 by a quantity d 0k + d ik , where d 0k is natural degradation during the k th trial in the absence of 268 for use under a CC0 license.
