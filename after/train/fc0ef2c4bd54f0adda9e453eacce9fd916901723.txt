The lockdown response to COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic 25 activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution 26 concentrations using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting 27
for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen 28 dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) 29 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 30 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere 31 although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to 32 NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-33 response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature 34 deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-35
lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 36
(1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced 37 deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 38 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be 39 avoided globally. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate 40 the potential health benefits gained from reducing "business as usual" air pollutant emissions from 41 economic activities. Explore trends here: www.covid-19-pollution.zsv.co.za 42 Significance statement 43 The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented reductions in 44 economic activity. We find that lockdown events have reduced air pollution levels by 45 approximately 20% across 27 countries. The reduced air pollution levels come with a substantial 46 health co-benefit in terms of avoided premature deaths and pediatric asthma cases that 47 accompanied the COVID-19 containment measures. 48 Introduction: 49 In many developing nations economic growth has exacerbated air pollutant emissions with severe 50 consequences for the environment and human health. Long-term exposure to air pollution 51 including fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5µm (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are 52 estimated to cause ~8.8 million excess deaths annually (1, 2), while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) results 53 in 4 million new paediatric asthma cases annually (3). Despite the apparent global air pollution 54 "pandemic", anthropogenic emissions remain on positive trajectories for most developing and 55 some developed nations (4-6). 56 57
The major ambient (outdoor) air pollution sources include power generation, industry, traffic, and 58 residential energy use (4, 7). With the rapid emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and 59
in particular the government enforced lockdown measures aimed at containment, economic 60 activity has come to a near-complete standstill in many countries (8). Lockdown measures have 61 included partial or complete closure of international borders, schools, non-essential business and 62 in some cases restricted citizen mobility (9). The associated reduction in traffic and industry has 63 both socio-economic and environmental impacts which are yet to be quantified. In parallel to the 64 societal consequences of the global response to COVID-19, there is an unprecedented 65 opportunity to estimate the short-term effects of economic activity counterfactual to "business as 66
usual" on global air pollution and its relation to human health. 67 68
Here we test the hypothesis that reduced air pollution levels during Feb/Mar 2020 were related to 69 the COVID-19 lockdown events. To test the hypothesis, satellite data are used to provide a global 70 perspective over Feb/Mar, but to estimate exposure levels relevant to public health, we derive 71 ground-level measurements from >10,000 air quality stations after accounting for meteorological 72
variations. The air pollution anomalies during COVID-19 lockdown are then used to quantify 73 mortality and pediatric asthma incidence that have been potentially avoided (Fig. S1 ). Similarly, aerosol optical depth (AOD: a proxy for PM2.5) has also increased slightly (+13.2% IQR: 97 35%), although local declines are evident over parts of China ( Fig. 1E; Fig. S2 ). While the 98 lockdown impacts on NO2 and on ground-level O3 in inhabited regions are largely due to local 99 emissions, PM2.5 is less locally controlled as it has an atmospheric lifetime of several days or 100 longer in the absence of rain. For instance, European AOD levels during March 2020 were 101 strongly influenced by dry weather with easterly winds, which carried mineral dust from West Asia, 102
which explains some of the positive anomalies in this period. Since much of the long-distance 103 dust transport takes place above the boundary layer (10), these AOD anomalies do not 104 necessarily represent ground-level PM2.5 trends. The same is true for satellite-measured O3, 105 which is strongly influenced by its generally increasing abundance above the boundary layer, 106 especially during winter. 107 108
Ground-level country-specific trends 109
While satellites provide global data coverage, they do not necessarily reflect pollutant 110
concentrations at ground-level that are relevant to human exposure and health. Therefore we 111
supplemented satellite data with ground-level pollutant concentrations collected by over 10,000 112 air quality stations. In contrast to the satellite data we used, station data allowed us to calculate a 113 more robust 3-year baseline measure of expected pollution levels for Feb/Mar. These data largely 114 corroborate the satellite data in that we found the same spatial patterns and net directions of 115
Feb/Mar 2020 pollutant anomalies ( Fig. 1 Focusing on the ground-level trends is illustrative of the change at both global ( Fig with the rapid lockdown response in Wuhan province at the outset of COVID-19. Thereafter, the 127 spread of COVID-19 led to lockdowns in various countries, associated with a greater negative 128 deviation in NO2 and PM2.5 from 3-yr baseline values (Fig. 2) . Some notable outliers include 129
Australia and Mexico. Australia exhibited drastic declines in PM2.5 from January onward likely 130 reflecting the tail-end of the recent wildfires (11). The rapid decline in NO2 over Mexican stations 131 is more difficult to explain, particularly given that Mexico, along with Taiwan, Slovakia and 132
Sweden, was one of the few countries not to enforce any national lockdown measures. 133 134
The trends for O3 and PM2.5 are more heterogeneous over space (Fig. 1D , F) and time (Fig. 2E , 135 F) relative to the ubiquitous declines in NO2. For instance, increases in O3 over southern China 136 differ significantly from the decreases observed over the Wuhan province, the epicenter of 137 COVID-19 (Fig. 1D ). We expect this to be a consequence of synoptic redistribution of O3 by 138 atmospheric circulations. Similarly, the local decreases over parts of Spain are in contrast to 139 increases observed over eastern Europe. This is not surprising given that O3 is affected by long-140 distance transport as well as non-linear chemical interactions with volatile organic compounds 141 (VOCs) and NOx, mediated by mesoscale and urban canopy weather patterns (12). 142 143
Direct links to COVID-19 lockdown and health outcomes 144
To test our primary hypothesis that pollution anomalies were directly associated with COVID-19 145 lockdown events, we calculated average ground-level concentrations for each country separately. 146
Instead of averaging over Feb/Mar, we focus on the two weeks after lockdowns were announced 147 in each country. We first corrected for the effects of local and meso-scale weather patterns 148 (temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed) which can significantly affect ground-level 149 .

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . pollutant concentrations (13, 14) and thereby compromise any observable effect of COVID-19 150 lockdowns. Using regression models, we estimated the lockdown-attributable anomaly (Fig. S1 ) 151
as the difference between observed and expected pollutant concentrations given weather during 152 lockdown. 153 154 We found a net decline of about 20% (5% to 35% -95% confidence interval) across all three 155 pollutants in countries where significant anomalies were detected. There were significant declines 156 in NO2 (29 %; 13% to 44%) and O3 (11%; 2% to 20%), however our model estimates were not 157 able to control for the confounding effects of weather enough to detect significant declines in PM2.5 158 (9% decline; -10 to 28%; Fig. S5 ). Indeed, our meteorological-control models were able to explain 159 less of the variance in PM2.5 (R 2 = 0.45) compared to NO2 (R 2 = 0.54) and O3 (R 2 = 0.72; Table  160 S1). This suggests PM2.5 has a weaker coupling to land-transportation and small business activity 161 declines during lockdown compared to NO2 and O3. In Many countries PM2.5 is more strongly 162 linked to residential energy use, power generation and agriculture (7). In addition, PM2.5 is 163 significantly influenced by long-distance atmospheric transport of mineral dust and therefore the 164 local effects of economic activity may be diluted or even overwhelmed (15). 165 166
Using the two week post-lockdown anomalies in combination with published exposure-response 167 functions for NO2 (16, 17), O3 (17, 18) and PM2.5 (17, 19), we estimated changes in daily all-cause 168 mortality burden and pediatric asthma incidence. During the two weeks post-lockdown, there were 169 a total of 7400 (340 to 14600) deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided 170 across 27 countries with recorded COVID-19 mitigation measures ( Fig. 3 ; Table S2 ). The number 171 of PM2.5-related deaths avoided (6800; 60 to 13700) exceeded those related to NO2 (540; 300 to 172 800) and O3 (50; 10 to 80). While for pediatric asthma incidence, NO2 reductions contributed to 173 more avoided cases (5700; 4500 to 6800) compared to O3 (50; 40 to 60) and PM2.5 (850; 300 to 174 1000). In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related reductions in mortality burden were 1400 (1100 175
to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively (Fig. 3C ). These are countries with both the 176 highest baseline pollution levels and population densities, and therefore have the most to gain 177 from pollutant declines. 178 179
Furthermore, we performed a counterfactual projection of reduced health burden assuming 180 ground-level air pollution deviations experienced during lockdown ( Fig. S5 ) are maintained for the 181 remainder of 2020 (Apr-Dec). The cumulative effect of the reduction in NO2, O3 and PM2.5 over 182 the remainder of 2020 is that 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric 183 asthma cases could be avoided ( Fig. 4 ; Table S3 ). Our findings suggest that, in spite of the 184 modest response of PM2.5, countries would have much to gain in maintaining PM2.5 lockdown 185 levels because that would prevent 0.6 (0.01 to 1.3) million deaths and 1.1 (0.4 to 1.4) million 186
pediatric asthma cases which is 3-and 5-fold higher than those from NO2 and 5-and 30-fold 187 higher than those from O3 (Fig. 4) . The bulk of the benefit gained would take place during the 188 latter half of the year when air pollution levels are at their highest over countries with the largest 189 air pollution health burden (i.e. India and China). 190 191

Making explicit links between ambient air pollution and human health burden relies on several 193 assumptions that are difficult to verify apriori. First, using relative risk rates from select meta-194 analysis (17) and multi-city (n>406) short-term time-series association studies (18, 19) to make 195 inference over entire countries rests on the assumption that city-or cohort-specific response rates 196 are generalizable to broader populations. While this is likely to introduce uncertainty, the dearth 197 of representative data necessities these generalizations, and this approach has been used by 198
numerous studies at the global scale (2, 3). Further, we acknowledge that our results are affected 199 by harvesting effects, where premature deaths attributed to air pollution might have occurred in 200 the immediate future (20). Note that this also applies to death counts attributed to COVID-19. We 201 also acknowledge that we do not account for indoor sources of PM2.5 pollution which are unlikely 202 to be reduced by lockdown measures. As smoke from household stoves add substantially to 203 population exposure for people dependent on solid fuels, accounting for ambient air pollution only 204 could imply a misclassification of exposure and biased health burden estimates (21). Finally, the 205 baseline mortality rates we use are from 2017 (22) and therefore may be prone to ignoring before 206 and after COVID-19 onset differences in baseline mortality incidence. 207 208
Despite these assumptions and the associated uncertainty, the analysis and results presented 209
here can provide useful insights to raise awareness and orientate interventions regarding the 210 global effects of air pollution on human health. They should be interpreted as preliminary lessons 211 from the Corona crisis. As the science evolves, and the COVID-19 pandemic plays out, empirical 212 data will emerge to fill in the knowledge gaps and uncertainties associated with air pollution health 213 burden attribution. It is expected that the two-week lockdown effects calculated here will be an 214 underestimate of the full effect because most lockdowns will likely last much longer than two 215
weeks. However, we suggest the current situation is a useful lens through which to view the global air 229 pollution "pandemic". Time will tell how significant the change in health burden has actually been. 230
Nevertheless, the early evidence presented here suggests it is likely significant. Reduced 231 premature mortality from air pollution thus appears as a co-benefit of the minimized number of 232 deaths from the lockdown measures, although more accurate, quantitative assessments must 233 await termination of the crisis.

data. These data were accessed from the OpenAQ Platform and originate from government-and 277
research-grade sources. See www.openaq.org for a list of sources. Despite the reliability of the 278 sources, we inspected pollutant time series for each country and removed spurious outliers in the 279 data with z-scores exceeding an absolute value of 3. Following quality control, we were left with 280 data representing 30 countries. 281 282
Quantifying air pollution anomalies 283 We used two approaches to quantify air pollution anomalies coincident with COVID-19 during 284
Feb/Mar 2020. We refer to these as (1) the Feb/Mar differential, and (2) the lockdown differential 285 (Fig. S1 ). For the Feb/Mar differential we calculated average pollutant levels for Feb/Mar each 286
year between 2017 and 2020. The differential was defined as the difference between 2020 values 287 and the average of those for a 3-year baseline (2017-2019 involved partial or full closure of borders and flights, government advisories for citizens to work 300 from home, closure of schools, and limiting gathering sizes. Severe lockdowns included 301 government-enforced movement restrictions or curfews and closure of all non-essential 302
businesses. This resulted in a sample of 27 countries that reported lockdown measures and which 303
we had ground-level air pollution data for. 304 305
Air pollution anomalies measured during two weeks post-lockdown are not necessarily 306 attributable to reduced economic activity, but may be an artifact of meteorological variability 307 coincident with the onset of COVID-19. Therefore we adopted a modelled differential approach to 308 correct for the effect of meteorological parameters on air pollution trends. This involved 309 developing a model based on historical data to estimate what the expected air pollution levels for 310 2020 lockdown dates should have been given the prevailing weather conditions and time of year. 311
We performed multiple linear regression of weekly pollutant concentrations on temperature, 312 humidity, precipitation and wind speed derived from the Global Forecast System (GFS) of the 313 National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) between Jan 2017 and Apr 2020. We 314
accounted for the effect of seasonal fluctuations and long-term trends by including month and 315
year as fixed effects in the model. We calculated the sin and cos component of the month variable 316
to account for its cyclical nature. Using models trained on historical data, we predicted the 317 expected pollutant levels for the two lockdown weeks. The modelled differential is then the 318 difference between this predicted value and the observed pollutant concentrations during 319 .

This differential has been attributed to COVID-19 mitigation measures with 320 greater confidence than simple comparisons with 3-yr baseline values. 321 322
Linking air pollution anomalies to public health burden 323
To relate COVID-19 lockdown air pollution anomalies to all-cause mortality and pediatric asthma 324
incidence we applied short-term (daily) exposure-response relationships reported in recent 325 literature. We obtained relative risks from recent studies on the relationship between daily 326 mortality and O3 (18) and PM2.5 (19) resulting from the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) 327
Collaborative Research Network (35). For NO2-mortality responses, we used relative risks 328
reported in a meta-analysis which controlled for the effect of particulate matter to extract excess 329 mortality solely attributable to NO2 (16). Pediatric (< 18 years) short-term relative risks for asthma 330 incidence in response to NO2, O3 and PM2.5 were derived from a global meta-analysis of 87 331 studies (17). These data are not country-specific and we therefore applied the same relative risk 332 rate to all countries in our study. 333
Daily health burden (premature mortality and asthma incidence) for each country was derived 334 with the formula: 335 336 Where Inc is the baseline mortality or asthma incidence rate and Pop is the total population. Inc 337 for mortality and asthma were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 338
for the 27 countries in our study (22) where ƛ is the relative risk reported in the literature and ẟ is the concentration increment used. All 351 three studies reported results relative to a of 10 µg m -3 . 352

for the remainder of the year. Using the resulting daily forecasts we calculated the total avoidable 360 air pollution related mortalities and new asthma incidence.
