The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spike protein is a smart molecular machine that instigates the entry of coronavirus to the host cell causing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a structural-topology based model Hamiltonian of C3 symmetric trimeric spike is developed to explore its complete conformational energy landscape using molecular dynamic simulations. The study finds 2019-nCoV to adopt a unique strategy by undertaking a dynamic conformational asymmetry induced by a few unique inter-chain interactions. This results in two prevalent asymmetric structures of spike where one or two spike heads lifted up undergoing a dynamic transition likely to enhance rapid recognition of the host-cell receptor turning on its high-infectivity. The crucial interactions identified in this study are anticipated to potentially affect the efficacy of therapeutic targets.
One Sentence Summary: Inter-chain-interaction driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy adopted by the prefusion trimeric spike protein likely to make 2019-nCoV highly infective.
We are in the midst of a global catastrophic situation due to coronavirus outbreak where every day the global death toll is biting the past count. While history has witnessed past pandemics (1-3), 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) trends to outcompete them all by its rapid transmission in a short period to win the crown. As the name 'corona' (in Latin, it means crown), the accused of the outbreak makes use of a 'crown-shaped' molecular machine, the trimeric spike-protein to drive the virus entry into the host cells. 2019-nCoV is the newest addition of betacoronavirus genus (4). While the sequence and structural similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike (SARS-CoV S) repute the identity of 2019-nCoV spike as SARS-CoV-2 S (5, 6), a recent study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 S has 10-20 fold higher affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor than that of SARS-CoV S (7).
The large ectodomain of the S glycoprotein of the coronavirus uses the S1 subunit for receptor binding and the trimeric S2 stalk for host-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 1A) (8, 9) . In SAR-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the β-sheet-rich S1 subunit comprises an N terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) towards its C-terminus (CTD) (Fig. 1B) . So far, static structural characterization reported that the RBD of S1 has an intrinsic hinge-like conformational was not certified by peer review)
movement that generates the 'up' and 'down' conformations (7, 8, 10) . Other betacoronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) also have this apparently stochastic RBD movement (11, 12) . The combination of RBD up-down rearrangement may lead each S1-head of the trimeric prefusion spike protein of coronavirus to adopt different possible conformations: (i) 3down, (ii) 1up-2down, (iii) 2up-1down, and (iv) 3up (Fig. 1C) . Among them 3down, 3up are symmetric conformers and 1up-2down, 2up-1down are asymmetric conformers. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) determined few such symmetric and asymmetric structures referred to as the receptorbinding inactive state and receptor-binding active state, respectively (8) . The asymmetric structure where one of the RBDs rotates up was thought to be less stable for SARS-CoV S (10) . In comparison, the recent Cryo-EM study found three RBDs in 1up-2down conformation as a predominant arrangement in the prefusion state of 2019-nCoV S trimer (7) . This arrangement apparently appears legitimate for SARS-CoV-2 S in order to explain the higher affinity of 1up-2down for ACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV S. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of 2up-1down conformation as a functional state, which may provide even stronger binding with ACE2 considering the fact that ACE2 is a dimeric receptor (9, 13) . This hypothesis is consistent with a recent crystallographic study demonstrating that CR3022, a neutralizing antibody isolated from convalescent SARS patients targets the RBD when at least two RBD on the trimeric spike protein are in the up conformation (14) . Assembling all these experimental results it is high time to understand the molecular mechanism of S1-head coordination of trimeric SAR-CoV-2 S and to identify important interaction in regulating spike up-down conformations. A schematic of receptor-bound spike protein including the receptor-binding subunit S1, the membrane-fusion subunit S2 of a coronavirus is shown. B. Side and top views of the homo-trimeric structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with one RBD of the S1 subunit head rotated in the up conformation. C.

A major challenge was simulating the gigantic structure of the full-length trimeric spike, as it is associated with the largescale conformational transition. It is indeed a daunting task to explore the full conformational landscape at an atomic length-scale. To overcome this, a structure-based coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation approach has been adopted (15) . The simulation started with a full-length homo-trimeric spike protein structure generated from homology modeling which involves the alignment of a target sequence and a template structure (pdb: 6vsb) (7, 16) . This also helped to build the missing loops. The domain-specific residuerange for the full-length, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S is given in Fig. 2A . The S1 head coordination of the trimeric spike is programmed by developing a super-symmetric topology-based modeling framework ( Fig. 2B ) (described in the Method pipeline in the supplementary material). With this, the molecular machine is ready to swing each of its S1 head between its 'up' and 'down' conformations (Movie S1, S2). A number of Cryo-EM structures captured the 'up' and 'down' conformations of the RBD domain of spike proteins of other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 where the S1 subunit undergoes a hinge-like conformational movement prerequisite for receptor binding (Fig. 2C) (7, 8, 10, 17) . Apart from the hinge-responsive RBD-cleft interaction, in this study, a few inter-chain interactions are found to assist the 'RBD-up' and the 'RBD-down' conformations (shown in Fig. 2D and 2E, Movie S3). These few interactions are identified to impact the breathing of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S. This makes the early referred 'RBD-up/down' conformations slightly different from the 'S1-head-up/down' conformation for trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S as the former is regulated only by intra-chain interactions while the latter is regulated by both intra and inter-chain interactions (Fig. S1 ). After identifying all these unique intra and inter-chain contacts (18, 19) extracted from the corresponding 'S1-head-up' and 'S1-head-down' conformations, a super-symmetric contact map is generated. This follows the development of a structure-based model Hamiltonian (Materials and Methods in Supplementary) which is based on the energy landscape theory of protein folding (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . This approach not only potentiates the trimeric spike to adopt C3 symmetric '3up' and '3down' states but also to break the symmetry in a thermodynamically governed way (Fig. S1-S4) (25, 26) .

Within intra-chain contacts, the unique contacts that drive hinge motion leading to RBD-up and RBD-down states are highlighted in the structure, as well as in the contact map. D.

To monitor the transition between the 'S1-head-up' and the 'S1-head-down' states for each monomer with the trimeric interactions, a large pool of unbiased longtime trajectories generated where multiple occurrences of up and down states for each monomer have been sampled. We employ a reaction coordinate, Q, the fraction of the native contact (19, 27) corresponding to the inter-chain contacts associated with the 'S1-head-up' and the 'S1-head-down' states. A typical trajectory plot of Q extracted from the equilibrium simulation of the trimeric prefusion spike clearly shows the hopping between different conformational states as hypothesized earlier (Fig.  3A) . Furthermore, the dynamic transitions between the two major asymmetric states (1up-2down: Q S1-head-down ≈0.45 and 2up-down: Q S1-head-down ≈0.15) are evident in the Q-trajectory. Analysis of all the simulations yields the 2-D free energy landscape of the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig 3B) with its all possible conformations. The conformations corresponding to the minima of the free energy landscape are shown in Fig.3C . The temperature dependence of conformational transition indicates that the configurational entropy and enthalpy compensation results in the enhanced population of the asymmetric 1up-2down to 2up-1down conformations ( Fig S4) . While the predominant population of the 1up-2down state is consistent with the recent Cryo-EM data, (7) (Movie S1, S2) the other asymmetric structure (2up-1down) emerges as a best binding epitope for CR3022 (an antibody collected from convalescent SARS patients) according to a recent antibody recognition study of SARS-CoV-2 S (14).

This comparison results that SARS-CoV-2 S has NTD-RBD domain association where a proline residue of ChainA forms CH-п type interaction with the tyrosine residue (28) and hydrophobic interaction with another proline of ChainB (Fig. 4A, Fig. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 22, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052290 doi: bioRxiv preprint S1). Inter-chain proline-proline distance measurement shows that the corresponding RBD-NTD domains are far away in the case of SARS-CoV S (Fig. 4B ) and further away in the case of MERS-CoVS (Fig. 4C ). This measurement involves their respective Cryo-EM structures. Despite the relatively high degree of sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and the SARS-CoV S and also with the spike protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, a single histidine residue at the relevant RBD-NTD domain interface is found unique in the vase of SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. S5 ) (29) . The imidazole ring of histidine is pointing towards the hydrophobic assembly of aforesaid proline-tyrosine in the juxtaposition of the RBD-S1 hinge region. Such inter-chain RBD-NTD connection is thus found to impact the RBD hinge interaction by upregulating more RBD-up conformation (Fig. 4D ). In the absence of such interchain interaction, the RBD mostly stays in the down conformation allowing RBD to break the symmetry rarely in a stochastic manner (Fig. 4E ). The absence of inter-chain RBD-NTD connection also appears to impact the SARS-CoV RBD hinge interaction. Here, the opening of RBD-S1 cleft is significantly less than that of SARS-CoV-2 S in their respective S1-head-up state (Fig. S6 ). The assistance from the inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk related interfacial contacts are also found to modulate the population dynamics of RBD-down conformation (Fig. S7 ). The influence of this inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk interaction has also been observed in an early Cryo-EM analyses where two proline mutations at the top of S2 stalk (inferring RBD-S2 inter-chain connection) helped to stabilize the 'up' conformers of SARS-CoV S (30) .
The synergy between internal RBD-hinge interactions and inter-chain interactions allows trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S to adopt a unique dynamical feature than other corona-virus spikes. It appears that the inter-chain interactions driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy potentiates this spike machine to turn on its high-infectivity. The energy landscape framework used in this study indeed helps to unify and compare different spike protein interactions present in other coronaviruses. While in the current situation to develop diagnostics and antiviral therapies are of utmost priority, the present structure-based model derived information at the microscopic interaction level might provide deep insight to design effective decoys or antibodies to fight against 2019-nCoV infection.

Method pipeline of building a super-symmetric contact map of SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike protein.
Coarse-grained structure-based simulations have been performed for full-length trimetric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The structure-based Hamiltonians for different simulations were derived after processing the recent Cryo-EM structure (pdb:6vsb) thorough the Swiss Model to complete missing loops present in the structure (7, 16) . This generates a homo-trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike where this initial structure has important components in terms of intra and inter-chain contacts (interaction) leading to an 'S1-head-up' and an 'S1-head-down' conformation for each protomer. In this prevalent trimeric variant, only one monomer adopts 'S1-head-up' and the same was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Interesting components are inter-chain contacts residing at the interface of the dimer. Now, two categories of interactive dimeric interfaces are there: asymmetric-dimer interface and symmetricdimer interface. ChainA (S1-head-up) and the adjacent ChainB (S1-head-down) represent an asymmetric dimer unit. Similarly, ChainB (S1-head-down) and the adjacent ChainC (S1-headdown) represent a symmetric dimer unit. At the asymmetric-dimer interface, the RBD-domain of

A structure-based Hamiltonian of trimeric spike protein for SAR-CoV2 is derived using the super-symmetric contact map. In the current structure-based model amino acids are represented by single beads at the location of the C-α atom (15, 25, 31, 32) . The coarse-grained structurebased model, a well-established model, comprehends a novel way to investigate the mechanisms associated with protein folding and function (20-22, 24, 33-38) . In the current context of decoding virus entry mechanism, this model successfully characterized Class-I viral fusion protein dynamics including conformational rearrangement of a viral surface glycoprotein, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) during its prefusion and postfusion states (26, 39) .
As described in the pipeline method, the complete Hamiltonian comprises of two terms:

The first non-local term of the Hamiltonian used in A/B/C intra H represents non-bonded interaction potential in the form of 10-12 Lennard-Jones potential that is used to describe the interactions that stabilize the native contacts (15) . A native contact is defined for a pair of residues (i and j) present in the native state using shadow criteria and when (i−j)>3. Δ ij is defined in such a way that if any i and j residues belong to intra C , Δ ij = 1 turning on 10-12 Lennard-Jones potential;
otherwise Δ ij = 0. For all non-native pairs for which Δ ij = 0, a repulsive potential with σ = 4Å is used. All the interaction coefficients used in this potential are given in Table S1 .
As described in the method pipeline, inter H will include only the non-local inter-chain contacts residing at the interface of the dimer which comprises of accounting for asymmetric-dimer

Population distribution as a function of the fraction of native inter-chain contacts formed in the S1-head-down state is monitored over these temperatures. Four states emerge as indicated in Fig. 3B and Fig. S4 . As the temperature increases the population shifts more towards the S1-head-up state. At T*=0.58T R the population of 1up-2down state appears as a predominant population in the conformational landscape which correlates well with the recent Cryo-EM data (7) . We have performed all our simulations being consistent with this selected temperature. The RMSD analyses ensure the correctness of the simulation progress and the emergence of the correct structure (Fig. S3) .
The population shifts more towards the S1-head-up state conformations as the temperature increases. It suggests that the S1-head-up states are more dynamic and entropically stable. Note that the dynamical transition between 1up-2down and 2up-1down states may tolerate a wide range of temperatures by a population shift mechanism. So far, we have examined that it tolerates the temperature range from T*=0.50T R to T*=1.67T R . Temperature dependence of RBD hinge motion has also been studied (Fig. S4) . Population distribution as a function of the fraction of native intra-chain hinge-region contacts formed by the RBD at different temperatures has been monitored. A bimodal distribution reflects the population of the 'RBD-up' and 'RBDdown' states for any individual chain being in trimeric spike. As temperature increases, the RBD-up states start to enhance their populations.
In a system, if a state "A" described by its reaction coordinate, X A (which in our case is the fraction of native contact) is separated from another state "B" described by its reaction coordinate, X B , by a finite barrier, the free energy of transition from A to B can be expressed as,
