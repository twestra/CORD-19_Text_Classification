A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) : bioRxiv preprint 2 of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-23 19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges 24 to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-25 drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at 26 ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were 27 freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by 28 Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual 29 moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, 30 specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly 31 prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature 32 (18~25℃) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37℃ and 56℃, 33 respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by 34 transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and 35 hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried 36 PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens. 37 38
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute 42 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of 43 international concern [1, 2] .

Both 45 infected persons and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are likely sources of new 46 infections [4, 5] . Timely diagnosis and management are essential for disease control. Real-47 time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is an accurate and 48 sensitive molecular technique and is considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis 49 of COVID-19 [6, 7] . 50 However, to maintain bioactivity, PCR reagents must be transported and stored at 51 a low temperature. This presents challenges to already overburdened transport logistics 52 networks and cold storage space at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. 53 Freeze-drying (lyophilization) is a low-temperature dehydration process mainly 54 used for stabilizing of heat-labile biological drug substances contained in aqueous 55 solutions [8] . Because water drives many destabilization pathways, removing most of the 56 water can prolong the shelf-life of the product [9, 10] . Because freeze-dried reagents 57 typically contain all of the necessary components for testing (at appropriate 58 concentrations), errors associated with improper handling of wet reagents can also be 59 reduced. This reduces preparation time and, thus, testing throughput. 60 There have been several recent publications investigating the possibility of freeze-61 drying PCR mixes. Klatser et al. freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of 62 mycobacterium, which could be stored at 4℃ and 20℃ for 1 year and at 56℃ for 1 63 week [11] .

This is 73 particularly relevant to the current study given that SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded 74 RNA coronavirus [17] .
Physical evaluation methods are critical when developing storable molecular 76 biology tools, but the published works have often neglected this. For example, the 77 residual moisture content is the most important factor affecting the quality and stability 78 of freeze-dried reagents [18, 19] , and the commonly applied reduced weight method is 79 inadequate. Karl-Fischer (KF) titration is an absolute method for measuring residual 80 moisture content and is accepted as the standard method for water content 81 determination in freeze-dried reagents [20] , but is rarely applied in studies because of its 82 complexity.
In addition, the choice of assessment method to evaluate the freeze-dried reagents 84 is pivotal. For example, regular PCRs are not quantitative, whereas rRT-PCR can report 85 the dynamic changes in product abundance during the whole process, and can be used 86 to detect reaction inhibitors or reduced activity.

Thermal cycling was performed at 50℃ for 5 min for reverse transcription, 119 followed by 95℃ for 10 min and then 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 s, and 55℃ for 30 s. The freeze-drying process consists of multiple consecutive phases. First, we loaded 130 the PCR tube strip containing the reagents into the shelf of the freeze dryer (Advantage 131 2.0，VITRIS), then lowered the shelf temperature gradually until -40℃ to freeze the 132 author/funder.

Next, the chamber pressure was decreased (from 133 760 mTorr to 100 mTorr) to establish the primary drying phase, enabling the 134 sublimation of all ice and the formation of a porous network. All freeze-drying phases 135 (freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying) were programmed sequentially at 136 fixed time points, and within each phase, critical process parameters were typically kept 137 constant or linearly interpolated between two setpoints. The procedure was as follows: The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 155 2.5 Sensitivity, stability, and specificity of the tests 156 The sensitivity of the freeze-dried PCR reagents (relative to freshly-prepared wet 157 reagents) was tested using a 10-fold serial dilution of nucleic acid. Each reagent was 158 reconstituted in 35 µl of nuclease-free water before adding 5 µl of the sample. We also The freeze-dried PCR mixes were stored at ambient temperature, 37℃, and 56℃, and 167 then reconstituted to their original volume with nuclease-free water at a periodic 168 interval. Retention of the reaction activity of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was tested 169 (relative to freshly-prepared wet reagents) by rRT-PCR.

The amplification efficiency and cycle threshold (Ct) value were mostly 178 unaffected by the addition of the lyophilization additives, but the fluorescence intensity 179 (Rn) was marginally decreased (Fig. 1A-C) . This indicates that the lyophilization 180 additive had no obvious effect on PCR and could be used for subsequent lyophilization. Figure 2B shows the freeze-dried PCR mixes after 28 days of simulated transport.
The appearance of the reagents was unchanged by the simulated transport, and no 190 powder floating was observed. This is likely because of the inclusion of PEG20000, a 191 biomacromolecule that helps maintain the shape of the freeze-dried product. (Table 2 ). In general, the level of addition agents in the PCR reagents and freeze-197 drying procedure should be adjusted to allow moisture levels of less than 3%; the 198 author/funder. All rights reserved.

By comparing the residual moisture of the ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targeting PCR 200 mixes, we found that the differences among these was not obvious, and are smaller than (Table 3) .
To enhance sensitivity, we attempted to reconstitute the freeze-dried regent as a 40-216 µl total volume mix. This equates to an 8-fold increase in the sample template, which The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934 doi: bioRxiv preprint calculation, reduced by three. By this approach, the assay was sensitive down to 221 template concentrations of 10 -6 . 222 In the repeatability assay, a 10-fold serial dilution of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 223 selected as the reaction template, and 12 batches of lyophilized mixes were randomly 224 selected for testing. We detected no meaningful differences in Ct value when comparing 225 the lyophilized reagents and wet reagents ( Table 4 ). The CV of the lyophilized reagent 226 was larger than that of the wet reagent, but the difference was not statistically significant The freeze-dried PCR mixes were stored for up to 28 days at either room temperature, 235 37℃, or 56℃, and, upon reconstitution, were tested relative to freshly-prepared wet 236 reagents. At day zero, the Ct values and fluorescence intensities obtained using the 237 lyophilization reagent were not decreased relative to the wet reagent (Fig. 4) , indicating 238 that PCR mixes could retain activity following lyophilization.
The freeze-dried PCR mixes were then tested at multiple time points during storage.
After storing at room temperature for 28 days, similar Ct values (Fig. 4A ) and 241 fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4B) were observed for freeze-dried and wet reagents. It 242 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

After 246 28 days of simulated transport, the appearance of the freeze-dried mixes was unchanged 247 (Fig. 2B) . Similar Ct values (Fig. 4C ) and fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4D) were 248 observed for freeze-dried and wet reagents when targeting the ORF1ab, N, and S genes.
Ideally, we would have liked to test the activity of the freeze-dried master mix after 250 12 months of storage at ambient temperature. However, given the ongoing outbreak and 251 our eagerness to share our findings, we opted to perform accelerated stability tests at 252 37℃ and 56℃. After storing at 37℃ for 2 weeks, the freeze-dried reagents performed 253 similar (Ct values) to the wet reagents (Fig. 4E) . The fluorescence intensities were 254 initially similar, but decreased gradually from the sixth day. The mixes retained half of 255 their original fluorescence intensity until the 14th day (Fig. 4F) . When stored at 56℃, 256 the freeze-dried reagents and freshly-prepared wet reagents initially perform similarly 257 (Ct values), but the freeze-dried mixes lose activity from the tenth day (Fig. 4G) . The 258 fluorescence intensity values decreased sharply at the beginning, and little fluorescence 259 could be detected on the 14th day (Fig. 4H) .
In conclusion, the freeze-dried mixes retain activity at room temperature for 28 261 days, and for 14 and 10 days at 37℃ and 56℃ respectively. Also, there were no obvious 
Freeze-drying is widely applied for the preservation and transportation of heat-labile 278 biological drug substances at ambient temperature [21, 22] . In this study, we present an 279 optimized freeze-drying formulation and procedure, allowing the stabilization of the 280 PCR mixes at ambient temperature. We used both physical and biological methods to 281 evaluate them comprehensively and systematically.
An ideal appearance is the basic requirement for lyophilized reagents' packing, 283 transportation, and preservation. It is mainly influenced by additive formulation and 284 freezing process. Trehalose, as an important lyophilization protectant, and plays a 285 crucial role in the lyophilization process. However, if the trehalose concentration is too 286 author/funder.

If some macromolecular 287 substances (e.g., PEG20000) are added in the PCR mixes, the mixed reagents can 288 become tightly connected after lyophilization, which can help to avoid disturbance 289 during transportation. The freezing process of freeze-drying can be divided into three 290 stages, and it is important to ensure that the reagents can be maintained at low 291 temperatures for sufficient time during the freezing process to make sure that ice 292 crystals can grow to the extent that no further ice crystal growth is possible. Otherwise, 293 the appearance of the freeze-dried reagents may be affected [23] .
Residual moisture content is an impact factor influencing the quality and stability 295 of freeze-dried PCR mixes [18, 19] . A high moisture level will decrease the stability of the 296 reagent. Since glycerol is hygroscopic, its presence in the final freeze-dried product 297 likely results in a high moisture content, which might affect the stability of the 298 product [24] . The commercial availability of glycerol-free Taq polymerases (enzyme) 299 would help to prolong the shelf life of freeze-dried PCR mixes [11] . However, removing 300 all water from the reagent would have deleterious effects on those reaction components, 301 proteins for example, that require certain amounts of bound water in order to maintain 302 proper conformations. Here, we found that a residual moisture content of 1-3% is 303 optimal for freeze-dried PCR mixes. 304 We chose rRT-PCR to evaluate the detection performance of the freeze-dried PCR 305 mixes. The supplemental ingredients added to the freeze-dried mixes did not affect the 306 Ct values, fluorescence intensity, or amplification efficiency of the PCR mixes. The 307 sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of freeze-dried reagents were similar to those 308 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We also found that the sensitivity of freeze-dried 309 PCR mixes could be improved by reconstituting the dried mix using the test sample 310 solution (to a volume of 40 µl). However, we did not observe the activity of lyophilized 311 PCR mixes beyond 28 days of storage. Given the ongoing outbreak and our eagerness 312 to share our findings, we opted to use an accelerated stability test to predict the long-313 term storage effect of the lyophilized reagent at room temperature. Klatser et al. 314 described a freeze-dried PCR mix for detection of mycobacteria, which could retain 315 activity at 4℃ and 20℃ for 1 year and at 56℃ for 1 week [11] . Unlike in the work of 316 Klatser et al., our freeze-dried PCR mixes contain a reverse transcriptase. Given that 317 our freeze-dried PCR mix could retain activity at 56℃ for 10 days, we predict that it 318 would remain active for 1 year when stored at room temperature.
In conclusion, we describe a method for producing thermostable freeze-dried PCR 320 mixes for use in COVID-19 diagnosis, with sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability 321 values that match those of freshly-prepared wet reagents. There were no obvious 322 differences in the performance of the freeze-dried mixes targeting the ORF1ab, N, and 323 S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this finding, we propose that the primers and probes 324 do not affect the efficiency of the lyophilization. 325 We propose that the method described here can now be transferred to the 326 lyophilization of PCR mixes targeting other pathogens by simply changing the primers 327 and probes. This approach will also be useful in tackling future major outbreaks or other 328 public health hazards. 329 330 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
