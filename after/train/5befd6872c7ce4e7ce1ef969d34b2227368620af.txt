Korean public health authorities raised the public alert to its highest level on February 23, 26 2020 to mitigate the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic. We have identified that the mean 27 delay from symptom onset to isolation was reduced to one day after raising the alert. Vigilance 28 can reduce this interval. 29 30 .

To assess the response's impact during the highest alert phase in Korea, we obtained data 40 on 576 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and 41
Prevention, the city department of public health, and news reports for February 1-March 30, 42 2020. We extracted information about confirmed cases using a structured data-extraction form. 43
We used case-based data on the date of exposure of confirmed cases, date of illness onset, and 44 date of isolation. We compared the time interval from illness onset to isolation before and during 45 the red alert (after February 23, 2020), assuming that the number of intervals was log-normal, 46
Weibull, or gamma-distributed (Appendix). Further, we conducted a similar analysis to identify 47 the interval from exposure to isolation. The range of intervals was reported with 95% confidence 48 intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). To identify the difference between these intervals in the 49 early epidemic and during the red alert, we conducted a Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical 50 analyses were performed in R version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). 51
Of the 576 laboratory-confirmed cases reported (6% of the 9,786 Korean COVID-19 52 cases as of March 31, 2020), 211 included the date of exposure, illness onset, or isolation and 53 .

The mean delay between symptom onset and isolation was 4.3 days 54 (95% CI 0.5-11.3 days) in the early phase and 3.3 days (95% CI: 0.5-9.4 days) during the red 55 alert. This reduction was significantly lower than in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemics in 56 Korea (p-value = 0.02). The mean delay from exposure to a confirmed case to isolation was 7.2 57 days (95% CI 1.7-14.4 days) before the red alert and 6.5 days (95% 1.7-15.7 days) during the 58 red alert (Figure) . Therefore, the mean delay was shortened by 0.8 days; however, this was not 59 significantly lower (p-value = 0.07). 60
Most COVID-19 transmissions occur during the presentation of symptoms of cases; 61 therefore, we believe that COVID-19-affected countries are making efforts to reduce the time 62 delay from symptom onset to isolation by strengthening countrywide surveillance and control 63 programs for COVID-19. In Korea, to enhance the surveillance, public health authorities have 64 operated 80 drive-through screening centers (operated since February 23, 2020) and have 65 designated 341 private hospitals as public relief hospitals for COVID-19 (operated since 66
February 25, 2020) [4, 5] . This provided easier access to screening tests for suspected cases of 67 COVID-19 in the community compared to the early phase and could reduce the interval from 68 symptom onset to isolation. 69
The delay from illness onset to isolation early in the epidemic in Korea is relatively 70 shorter than that in China (mean estimate of 5.8 days, 95% CI 4.3-7.5 in early January 2020) [6] . 71
However, more efforts are needed from public health authorities and the public to prevent the 72 potential spread of COVID-19 in communities since the infectiousness of COVID-19 begins 73 before illness onset [7] . 74 .
