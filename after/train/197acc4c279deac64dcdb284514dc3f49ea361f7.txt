To establish the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of 24 SARS-CoV-2.
The most efficient pool size was determined to be 5 specimens using a web-based application.
From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from one SARS-CoV-28 2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) 29 for a total volume of 250 microliter l. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and 30 tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into 31 individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an 32 unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12-pools.
All 25 pools were positive with Cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original 35 individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that two pools were positive 36 followed by identification of two individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was 37 accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.
When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the 40 saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.

The second step in the assay employs reverse transcription and amplification using a real 54 time PCR instrumentation. The assay therefore requires two kits, one for extraction and another 55 for amplification of the target and detection. We investigated whether a strategy used in the testing 56 of blood prior to transfusion could have application for conservation of scarce reagents for the 57 SARS CoV-2 assay 4,5 . The process of group testing that employs sample pooling is used for 58 detection of the human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses 4 in blood products.
Key principles for successful application of group testing involve knowledge of the limit-of-60 detection, sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the prevalence of disease in the population.
The goal of the process is to determine a pool size that provides the greatest conservation of 62 resources while maintaining the reliable performance of testing.

Although the prevalence of COVID-19 in Nebraska has not been specifically defined by 67 comprehensive epidemiology studies, the observed specimen positive rate within the tested 68 community has been around 5% for the past two weeks.
The following parameters and 69 assumptions used in this calculation included an experimental prevalence rate of 5%, an assay 70 lower limit-of-detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies/Âµl, an assay sensitivity of 95% or 100%, an assay 71 specificity of 100%, a two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples 6 .
These calculations predicted a pool size of 5 samples would provide the largest reduction in the 73 expected number of tests of 57% when compared to testing specimen separately ( Figure 1 ).

To 92 examine this approach in a clinical situation, 60 specimens from individuals at risk for COVID-19 93 as determined by the public health department were separated randomly into 12 pools, which were 94 processed as described. Two of the pools were characterized as "2019-nCoV detected" by the The practical application of this process was confirmed with 60 samples from the 108 community resulting in the saving of reagents and personnel time that could expand testing to an 109 additional 38 samples.

During a rapidly changing epidemic, testing strategies will need to adapt to potential 113 increases in the positive test rate. Group testing of pooled specimens also requires the use of highly 114 sensitive assays to avoid missing low positive samples. Therefore, strategies must be employed to The authors thank the staff of the Biology Section within the Nebraska Public Health 126 Laboratory for processing of the specimens and performance of the assay.
