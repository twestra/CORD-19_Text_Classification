unprecedented pandemic infecting more than one millon people, which is declared by WHO as a international public health emergency. Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. . We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype.
The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients.
Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients.
High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/μl ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/μl, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with : medRxiv preprint eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566,], p=0.039).
Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients.
Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation.
Since December, 2019, a series of resembling viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause have occured in Wuhan, China, with clinical presentations inclued fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, dyspnoea, sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea. This resembling viral pneumonia was similar to the severe respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 COVID-19 has become a global unprecedented pandemic infecting more than one millon people, which is declared by WHO as a international public health emergency.
The overall rate of severe cases was 16.0%, and mortality was 3.2% in a nationwide analysis of China 4 . Elderly people, complicated with comorbidities, impaired immune function, and involvement of multiple lung lobes are risk factors of patients for having severe or critical disease 5,6 . At an early stage, increased serum d-dimer predicts a poor prognosis pf COVID-19 patients 7 . Meanwhile, lower counts of CD3 + CD8 + T cells and high cardiac troponin I are two predictors for high mortality of COVID-19 8 . All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In this multi-center retrospective study, a total of 59 patients with COVID-19
were reviewed from January 23, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Of the 59 patients, 5 were mild, 46 were moderate, 8 were severe. The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type was significantly older than patients with mild or moderate type (median age: 57 vs 24 vs 37 years old, p=0.001). Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) than patients with mild to moderate type (p<0.05) ( Table 1 ). Other common symptoms included cough, sputum, fatigue, and myalgia did not reach statistic differences among these types. Fifteen of 59 patients (25.4%) had one or more comorbidities, mostly in patients with severe type (62.5%, p=0.020) ( Table 1 ). Laboratory findings indicated that increases of D-Dimer (median concentration: 1ng/ml) and CRP (median concentration: 88.2 mg/dl) were observed in patients with severe type compared with mild to moderate type (median concentration: 0.19 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml, p =0.01; 0.86 mg/dl and 12.64 mg/dl , p=0.007; respectively). Lower counts of lymphocyte (median counts: 900 cells/ μ l) and eosnophils (median counts: 100 cells/μl) were observed in patients with severe type, though there were no statistic differences among these types ( Table 1 ). All patients received CT scans, radiological features of lungs showed that 5 of patients (8.5%) All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Nineteen of 59 patients (32.2%) were treated with corticosteroids after admisson.
The use of corticosteroids therapy was highest in severe COVID-19 patients (75%) than in mild (0) and moderate (28.3%) patients (p=0.009) ( Table 2 ). All patients received antiviral treatments including inhalation of recombinant interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and oseltamivir. One severe patient received convalescent plasma therapy and tocilizumab ( Table 2 ). Radiographic improvement time was longer in patients with severe type than that in moderate type (median days: 10.5 vs 8.5, respectively, p=0.001). No statistic differences were observed in viroloy improvement time and hospital stay among mild to severe type ( Table 2) .
The median age of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia was significantly higher than that in patients with non-eosinopenia (47 vs 36, respectively, p=0.042).
Eosinopenia patients had higher temperature than non-eosinopenia patients (median highest temperature: 38 vs 37.7, p=0.02 ). Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients (80% vs 44.8, p=0.007; 46.7% vs 13.8, p=0.01; 63.3% vs 37.9, p=0.07; respectively).

Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/μl ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/μl, p<0.001). The AST concentrations (median value: 28.5 U/L) in eosinopenia patients were higher than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median value: 23 U/L, p=0.048). Other laboratory parameters as well as radiological features of lung did not reach statistic differences between the two groups (Table 3) .
After admission, the use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Radiographic improvement time (median days: 9.5) and hospital stay (median days: 17) in patients with eosinopenia were numerically longer than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (median days: 6.0 and 15, respectively) (Table 4 ). However, there were not statistic differences between the two groups. All patients received inhalation of recombinant interferon. Twenty-eight of 30 eosinopenia patients were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, 14 with arbidol, and 6 with oseltamivir. Convalescent plasma therapy and tocilizumab were used in one severe patient with eosinopenia (Table 4) .

In this study, all COVID-19 patients with severe type were cured. The counts of eosnophils as well as lymphocyte were dramatically elevated and normalized in recovery patients with severe type compared with those at adimission. The counts of white blood cells did not differ between both groups ( Figure 1 ).
COVID-19 has become an emerging, and rapidly evolving public health emergency worldwide. By unbiased sequencing from samples from patients, a novel virus named SARS-Cov-2 (previously named 2019-nCoV) was confirmed to be the seventh meber of the coronaviruses family 2 . Recent meta-analysis of data from patients with COVID-19 indicates that fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, expectoration, and dyspnea are main clinical symptoms. Other symptoms included headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are minor. Remarkably, lymphopenia is frequent in COVID-19 patients 1, 15, 16 . Tao Chen and colleagues reported that higher proportion of lymphopenia in deceased patients with COVID-19 than that in recovered patients, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In the present study, we reported clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, and first described the clinical features of a novel type of COVID-19: eosinopenia phenotype. It is hoped that results of this study will deep the knowledge of COVID-19 in the future work.
Adequate evaluation of the severity in COVID-19 is of crucial importance.
Mounting evidence have indicated that eldly COVID-19 patients are inclined to develop severe condition, and higher rates of dyspnea, lymphopenia, CRP, and D-dimer in severe patients than those in moderate patients 10, 11, 13, 17 . Consistent with previous studies, we found that the median age of COVID-19 patients with severe type were significantly older than patients with mild or moderate type, and severe patients had higher proportions of dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms than patients with mild to moderate type. Meanwhile, the results of this study indicated that the proportions of cough, sputum, fatigue, and myalgia were numerically high in severe patients. Chest CT plays an vital role in differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Li X, etal reported that around 83% COVID-19 patients had more than two lobes involved, and most images were multiple lesions localized in the peripheral of bilateral lungs 18 . In this study, all patients received chest CT scans, the radiological features of lungs showed that 72.9% COVID-19 patients and 87.5% severe patients had bilateral pneumonia. We found that one-third of COVID-19 patients were treated with corticosteroids which was highest in severe patients (75%). All patients received antiviral treatments, and one severe patient received convalescent plasma therapy and All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

No statistic differences were observed in hospital stay among patients in this study may due to lack of adequate knowledge of this unprecedented pandemic.
In the present study, lymphopenia, and increases of D-dimer and CRP were more common in severe COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 may primarily infect T lymphocytes, resulting in lymphopenia as well as decrease of IFN-γ production 10 .
Lymphopenia and elevated CRP may be useful predictors for developments of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients 19 .
Dysfunctions of blood coagulation in severe COVID-19 patients should be paid more concerns. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients is around 25 %. D-dimer is a promising biomarker for identifying high-risk groups of VTE 20 . Of note, in this study, more than half of COVID-19 patients developed eosinopenia, particularly severe patients (75%). Similar results were reported in previous studies 9, 13, 14 . Eosinopenia may indicate a poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Autopsy of deceased COVID-19 revealed minimal eosinophils or eosinophils in lung tissues 21,22 . However, the pathogenesis of eosinopenia in COVID-19 remains to be determined, which may be related to depletion of CD8 T cells producing IL-5 to stimulate eosinophil proliferation, or eosinophil consumption caused by higher viral load of SARS-CoV-2 13,14 .
Eosinophils play an important role against parasitic infection, and produce antiviral molecules against respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and influenza 23 . However, the role of eosinophils in SARS-Cov-2 infection is largely unknown. In this study, COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were older than All rights reserved.

Early corticosteroids therapy is close associated with high blood SARS-Cov load and delayed MERS-Cov clearance 28 . Therefore, corticosteroids therepy should be avoided in patients with COVID-19 unless there are indications for moderate or severe ARDS, and septic shock.

First, despite this was a multi-center retrospective study in Anhui province, China, samples of this study were still small, which may lead to unavoidable bias. Second, clinical significance of eosinopenia in COVID-19 needs further investigations. Finally, this study was a observational study, more experimental research should be performed to reveal the pathogenesis of eosinopenia in COVID-19.
