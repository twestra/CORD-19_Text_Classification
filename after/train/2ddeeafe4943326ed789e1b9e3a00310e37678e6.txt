Importance: Reliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and to assess the effectiveness of interventions.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused over 115,000 deaths, with global deaths doubling every week. 1-3 Mortality is less biased than case reporting, which is affected by testing policies. However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place. [4] [5] [6] Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12 th . We report also on six US states that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix). 1 We quantify the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over longer time periods.
The goal of the University of Toronto's GCAM is to provide medium-term mortality forecasts.
For each country, US state, and for Hubei Province in China, GCAM uses non-linear regressions to fit a five parameter model to the observed daily mortality counts. We used Bayesian inference, via the algorithm from Carpenter et al., 7 of several thousand posterior ("prior") .

We systematically collected COVID-19 mortality data for all countries with more than 100 deaths. We examine the top ten countries ranked by the total number of COVID-19 deaths as of April 12 th : USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium, Hubei province, China (as this accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany and the Netherlands. We also included Switzerland, Canada and the US States of New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington. We collated daily mortality data (where reported by age and sex) from the World Health Organization (WHO), country reports, 10 and from online data collections. 1-3
Definitions of COVID-19 mortality vary across countries. The WHO has created a new International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition, ICD-10 code, U07.2, 11 but this has been .

In some countries (e.g., the Netherlands), only deaths of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are counted as definitely due to the virus. 12 We deemed each setting's epidemic to have begun on the day after the first death is recorded. We forecast deaths until October 1, 2020, but most deaths will have occurred by July 1.
To enable contrasts with current COVID-19 mortality (which is nearly always from acute respiratory failure), we examined the WHO Mortality database 13 to quantify the average baseline pneumonia and influenza deaths during 2015-17. For the US, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality database, 14 and for China, we used the Global Burden of Disease. 15 We obtained age-and sex-specific population denominators from the United Nations Population Division, 16 and for Hubei, China, and for US states, from national vital statistics. 14,17
We assumed the mean number of daily deaths for each setting to follow the shape of a skewnormal density function, which resembles a typical "bell-shaped" normal distribution with added skewness to permit an epidemic to rise fast but fall slowly (as has already been observed with COVID-19 deaths). 1-3 The observed deaths Yi(t) in region i on day t follows a negative binomial distribution with mean λi(t) and overdispersion parameter τ, or more specifically:

The Ei are age and sex standardized death counts, obtained from each country's population data and age-specific mortality risk calculated from Italian data on 29 March 2020. 18 The model parameters which determine the shape of the epidemic curve are: Ci, the expected total deaths relative to the Italian rates on 29 March; Ai, the location of the peak of the epidemic; Bi, the duration of the epidemic (roughly the standard deviation); Ki, the skewness parameter specifying the steepness of the growth phase of the epidemic relative to the decline phase; and
Di, a 'spark' term allowing for occasional deaths outside the range of the main epidemic.
We used the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm within the Stan software. 7 From each posterior sample of the model parameters, we computed the intensity λi(t) and simulated potential future death counts from the negative binomial distribution. We calculated predictions envelopes, which contain the entire true epidemic curve from the samples by applying the methodology of Myllymäki et al. 19 We chose probability distributions to generate simulated epidemic curves consistent with data from Italy and Hubei, China, 1-3 and with SARS and MERS outbreaks. 8, 9 The Supplementary Appendix provides the prior distributions for all parameters, as well as simulated epidemics for a population with Italy's demographic structure.
As model validation, we fitted the model to training data of deaths on or before March 20 and compared the projections with data observed up to April 12.
For each country, we present the actual mortality daily totals, projected daily and totals, the date of peak mortality and derive credible intervals (CI), at various probability levels. We calculated age-specific mortality rates at age 20 years or more for influenza and pneumonia, and present totals for both sexes, as COVID-19 deaths are only rarely reported in children and .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. Figure 1 shows the results for six European countries with over 2,000 COVID-19 deaths to date and the USA. Each blue dot indicates daily actual deaths. The dark line is the median model projection and the red shaded area represents credible intervals. Mortality has already peaked in Italy and Spain (March 29 and April 1, respectively). The Netherlands and France next peaked on April 5 and 7, respectively, followed by Belgium (April 9) and Germany (April 13). The USA and UK will reach their peaks on April 18 and 21, respectively. Table 1 . The USA can expect 49,000-249,000 deaths (median 86,000). Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Ranges for other countries are as shown. Collectively, across the 12 countries, the range of deaths is 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The lowest value would be .

The maximum would represent more than 500% increase of deaths. As a proportion of all annual mortality, the median estimate of excess COVID-19 mortality ranges from 1.0% in Hubei to 8.1% in Belgium. Median deaths in the USA and the UK represent 3.2% and 7.8%, respectively of total non-COVID-19 deaths in 2020.
The column called precision represents the ratio of upper to lower uncertainty estimates. The most precise estimates are in settings where the epidemic has peaked or nearly peaked: Hubei, China (1.1), Italy (1.3), and Spain (1.5). The least precise estimates are for Canada (11.1) and
California (10.6) . The USA and the UK show moderate precision 5.1 and 4.4, respectively. Table 2 provides an estimate of the maximal daily totals, ranging from median values of 4, 787 in the USA to 114 in Switzerland, and within the USA, individual states ranging from 1,303 in New York to 49 in Washington state. We used the average annual deaths in previous years from pneumonia and influenza in both sexes above age 20 years as a crude indicator of existing hospital and ventilator capacity. We compare these totals against the median COVID-19 deaths, and this ratio provides an estimate of the "surge" capacity needed to deal with the excess COVID-19 deaths. The highest ratios are in France and Spain (each 2.1). We estimate the number of days in which COVID-19 deaths will exceed the daily death total of pneumonia in earlier years to be highest in Canada at 73 (39-104) with other settings averaging 62 days (48-83).

All three countries reported their first case almost simultaneously, but Germany took the most aggressive steps to expand testing. Compared to the other two countries, the German peak is lower with fewer peak day deaths. Similarly, the rapid and early increase in deaths in New York state (mainly in New York City), which accounts for about 25% of the forecasted USA death totals, contrasts with the flatter trajectory in 
Our forecasting predicts that in 12 early high-burden countries, the minimum number of COVID-19 deaths will be about 50% higher than current, reaching about 167,000 deaths.
However, a worst case scenario would be just under 593,000 deaths, or a 500% increase over current totals. Much of the trajectory across these countries depends on what happens in the USA, which accounts for 30-40% of the cross country forecasted totals. Within the USA, COVID-19 deaths will be a minimum of 49,000 or about 2 fold over current, but could reach 249,000.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. Within the US, most of the increase will be from outside the initial six states we examined, and in these settings micro epidemics with different trajectories are likely to occur, as has been observed in sub-parts of Italy and Spain. 1-3
The wide variation in forecasted mortality suggests interventions might help reduce the eventual total. Reassuringly, our analyses is sufficiently robust to fit actual death patterns in Italy and Spain, and confirms that Germany, Washington and California, which have taken testing, isolation and other strategies seriously have flatter trajectories and lower daily totals than areas with looser measures. This has allowed valuable time to scale up acute bed and ventilator capacity.
An acute excess of hospitalizations and deaths, clustered over short time periods, can swamp any health system, as indeed happened in northern Italy. Italy faced more pressures in one month on ventilator and critical-care bed supply than the usual annual burden. 21 Model-based estimates for the USA suggest that above age 55 years, ten people will need hospitalization for every COVID-19 death. 22 For each country, GCAM provides additional details of when these deaths will peak and the duration of excess deaths, which will average about 62 days but with a wide range (Indeed suggesting that California already has sufficient capacity to meet the surge of cases). Such information should aid planning and help avert an overwhelming of health systems.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161 doi: medRxiv preprint Initial infectious disease models estimated total COVID-19 deaths in the USA of 1 to 2.2 million (roughly 40% to 80% over and above the usual annual total of 2.8 million deaths) if no action were taken. 23 These same projections suggested 510,000 COVID-19 deaths in the UK, roughly doubling the current annual total. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model considers physical distancing through May 2020 and has median death estimates lower than ours (Supplementary Appendix). However, the IHME model has some implausible results like suggesting that Netherlands will have 16,000 deaths which is only slightly below their estimate for France and Spain, despite being at least three times larger in population. 22 Moreover, the IHME analyses assumes a symmetrical bell-shaped mortality curve, whereas a skewed curve (which we use) is observed in the actual data. 1-3 Our totals for the USA fall broadly within the range projected by the White House Task Force of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths, 24 and our Canadian estimates are consistent with infectious disease dynamic model results. 25 There is little doubt that some of GCAM forecasts are wrong as undercounts of COVID-19 and delayed reporting are common. [4] [5] [6] For example, the undercount in UK COVID-19 deaths might have been about 70% for some weeks. 4 For France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, we could find some record of undercounts and correcting for these substantially raised the total deaths in each country (Supplementary Appendix). However, systematic examination of undercounts across settings is needed to establish if the undercounts have accelerated during the epidemic, which would mean that we have underestimated the speed of the upward trajectory, or if they are more random, in which case our results would mostly be unaffected. Future iterations of GCAM will incorporate undercounts in as many countries as document these. Differences in .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161 doi: medRxiv preprint reporting across countries does not bias the results for any one country however, as mortality forecasts rely on actual counts within each country. Third, in settings with few deaths over many days, the model becomes highly sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. However, the model validation (Supplementary Appendix) showed reasonably good performance with actual death counts in several countries. As with all models, ours emphasizes the need to obtain additional days of observation and rerun the analyses as data improve, and as additional epidemiological research results become available. 26 The GCAM is set up to be do so, hence its results improve constantly.
In a time of crisis, open data sharing is particularly important, hence the full input details and code of GCAM are freely available (www.cghr.org/covid) and we welcome criticisms and suggestions on how to refine our estimates. We provide a simple metric of precision that can be used to gauge improvements over time. Future iterations will also provide estimates for subnational regions of the USA and other countries, particularly for Asian and African countries with weaker health systems and mortality surveillance capacity. 27 .
