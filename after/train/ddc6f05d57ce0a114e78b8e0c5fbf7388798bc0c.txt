Passaged sample names and cell lines are 120 described in the methods. An in-house pipeline (available at: 121 https://github.com/katarinabraun/SARSCoV2_passage_MS) was applied to trim out primer 122 sequences, bioinformatically deplete host reads, and generate alignment files, which contained 123 all reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 Madison reference genome (MT039887.1). At the 124 consensus level, SARS-CoV-2 does not accumulate genetic variation after two passages on 125
Vero 76 cells (Fig 2) . We also examined deletions ≥ 1% frequency and ≥ 3 nt in length. We found 126 no evidence of deletions that fit these criteria in any of the cell culture isolates. 127
To characterize patterns of sub-consensus diversity, we looked at SNVs at or above 1% 129 frequency in only the Illumina reads. We previously established that this conservative cutoff 130 ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered [15, 16] . All minor variant analyses and 131 figures were completed using the Illumina SNV data as these data are higher average quality 132 and ideal for analysis involving low-frequency variants (Fig 3) . Seventy-five percent of all minor 133 variants we identify fall in ORF1a and ORF1b, which together take up 72.8% of the length of the 134 28kb coding genome. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replicase machinery [7] . We account for 135 differences in gene size by normalizing variants to kilobase gene length (variants / kb-gene-136 length -"v/kbgl") [10] . The highest density of variants was reported in smaller genes like 137 envelope, ORF7a, and ORF10 (S2 Table) . We also show that through each passage, variant 138 density in ORF1a and ORF1b increases. There were no SNVs ≥ 1% in the spike gene in the 139 primary NP swab, but low-frequency SNVs (all <5%) were identified in spike following passage 140 in cell culture (Fig 3) . Outside of ORF1a and ORF1b, the other genes in the primary NP swab 141 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Specifically, we calculated genewise 189 diversity using π , the average number of pairwise differences per nucleotide site among a set of 190 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Overall, genewise nucleotide diversity is very low 191 compared to other RNA viruses, consistent with low mutation rates in coronaviruses due to RNA 192 proofreading machinery [18, 19] . Genewise diversity was very low in the primary NP swab and 193 was only measurable in ORF1a (9 SNVs), ORF1b (5 SNVs) and N (1 SNV). Genewise diversity 194 is more varied in the passaged samples (Fig 5) . Interestingly, π is highest in ORF7a in these 195 samples -although this signal seems to be primarily driven by the small size of this gene.

We examined the concordance between SNV calls at the same sites, irrespective of frequency, 207 determined by Illumina and ONT workflows. To begin, we used a stringent cutoff of 10% 208 frequency for ONT SNVs. We then called variants at percentage frequencies decreasing by 209 0.5% (eg. calling 8% variants, then 7.5%, etc) until the variants called by ONT no longer 210 matched Illumina variants irrespective of frequency at these sites (Fig 6, S1 Illumina and ONT at lower frequencies in the passaged samples because viral titer in vitro 219 typically exceeds viral titer in vivo resulting in higher average coverage in the passaged samples 220 required to support minor variant calls at lower frequencies. Oxford Nanopore kits SQK-LSK109. Samples were barcoded using the Oxford Nanopore Native 327 Barcodes (EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114), and pooled to a total of 140ng prior to being run 328 on the appropriate flow cell (FLO-MIN106) using the 72hr run script. 329
Amplified cDNA was purified using a 1:1 concentration of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, 331
Brea, CA, USA) and eluted in 48µL of water. PCR products were quantified using Qubit dsDNA 332 high-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, USA) and were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 ng/µl (1 ng 333 in 5 µl volume).

Samples were purified using two consecutive AMPure bead cleanups (0.5x 337 and 0.7x) and were quantified once more using Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, 338 USA). The average sample fragment length and purity was determined using Agilent High were pooled with seven other samples (not included in this manuscript) and were denatured to a 346 final concentration of 14pM with a PhiX-derived control library accounting for 1% of total DNA 347 and was loaded onto a 600-cycle v3 flowcell. Average quality metrics were recorded, reads 348 were demultiplexed, and FASTQ files were generated on Illumina's BaseSpace platform. 349
Seventy-two hours after sequencing was initiated, raw sequencing reads were demultiplexed 351 using qcat (https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat). In order to deplete host sequences, 352 sequencing reads are mapped against host genome and transcript references, and unmapped 353 reads are saved. Reads were then trimmed by 30bp on each side to discard SISPA primer 354 sequences. In this step, reads with quality scores ≤ 7 were discarded. Cleaned viral reads were 355 then mapped to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-356 WI1/2020 consensus sequence (Genbank: MT039887.1, originally sequenced by the CDC) 357 using minimap2. Minor variants from ONT sequences that comprise at least 10% of total 358 sequences in any of the samples were identified using the bbmap callvariants.sh tool 359 .
