C3A is a sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with the strong contact inhibition 26 of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-27 OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into 28 C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential 29 susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and 30 LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at 31 significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression 32 of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While 33 overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-34 OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to 35
HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry 36 mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently 37 pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or 38 amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus 39 entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The 40 work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that 41 controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.
and CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N) as their receptor, respectively (17, 18) . However, 78
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 bind to 9-Oacetylated sialic acids via a conserved receptor-79 binding site in spike protein domain A to initiate the infection of target cells (19) . As the key 80 determinant of cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis, CoV entry is primarily controlled by 81 interactions between the spike envelope glycoprotein and host cell receptor as well as the 82 susceptibility of spike glycoprotein to protease cleavage and/or acid-induced activation of 83 membrane fusion (20, 21) . For instance, SARS-CoV can use ACE2 orthologs of different animal 84 species as receptors (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) and the efficiency of these ACE2 orthologs to mediate SARS-CoV 85 cell entry is consistent with the susceptibility of these animals to . 86
In addition, expression of endosomal cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane proteases 87 (TMPRSS), furin, and trypsin differentially modulates the entry of different human CoVs (31-88 35) . other human CoVs, HCoV-OC43 hijacks human IFITM2 or IFITM3 as entry factors to facilitate 98 its infection of host cells (42, 43) . We also demonstrated recently that GILT suppresses the entry 99 of SARS-CoV, but not other human CoVs (38) . As reported herein, in our efforts to identify host 100 efficiency of HCoV-OC43pp infection in C3A cultures is approximately 50 folds higher than 124 that in HepG2 cultures. These results clearly indicate that the differential susceptibility is 125 attributed to the distinct ability of the two cell lines to support the infectious entry of 128 IFITM proteins modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of C3A and HepG2 cells in a similar 129 extent. We reported previously that IFITM proteins differentially modulate HCoV-OC43 entry 130 into target cells. While IFITM1 inhibits the virus entry, IFITM2 and IFITM3 enhance the cellular 131 entry of this virus (42). To investigate whether the differential expression of IFITM proteins in 132 the two cell lines is responsible for their difference in HCoV-OC43 infection efficiency, we 133 examined IFITM protein expression by Western blot assays and found the two hepatoma cell 134 lines expressed similar levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2/3 (Fig. 1B) . Because the C-terminal 135 variable regions of IFITM1 and IFITM3 control the inhibition and enhancement of HCoV-OC43 136 entry (42), respectively, we further compared the effects of IFITM1 and C-terminal region 137 exchanged IFITM proteins on the virus infection. As shown in Fig. 3 , in spite of their distinct 138 susceptibility, expression of IFITM1-EX2, a mutant IFITM1 protein with its C-terminal domain 139
replaced with the C-terminal domain of IFITM3 (42), and IFITM3-EX2, a mutant IFITM3 140 protein with its C-terminal domain replaced with the C-terminal domain of IFITM1 (42), 141 significantly enhanced and inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection of both cell lines, respectively, as 142 evidenced by the significant changes in infected cell percentage (Fig. 3A) , reduced viral 143 nucleocapsid protein expression (Fig. 3B ), intracellular RNA accumulation (Fig. 3C ) and yields 144 of progeny virus production (Fig. 3D) . Moreover, pseudotyped lentiviral infection assay further 145 demonstrated that IFITM1, IFITM1-EX2 and IFITM3-EX2 modulated HCoV-OC43 envelope 146 .

Accordingly, we 147 concluded that IFITM proteins were not responsible for the observed differential susceptibility of 148 the two hepatoma cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection. 149 150 LY6E inhibits the entry mediated by human CoV envelope spike proteins and is 151 responsible for the differential susceptibility of C3A and HepG2 cells to HCoV-OC43 152 infection. In order to identify host cellular proteins that may enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of 153 C3A cells or suppress the virus entry into HepG2 cells, we first compared the expression of 154 several cellular genes with known activity to restrict or enhance virus entry into target cells. As 155 shown in Fig. 4A , we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E mRNA expressed at significantly 156 higher levels in HepG2 cells. While the expression of ADAP2 and GILT did not inhibit HCoV-157
OC43pp infection (Fig. 4B) , expression of LY6E in Flp-In TREx 293 cells efficiently suppressed 158 the infection of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of all the human 159
CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, except for SARS-CoV ( Fig. 4C and 4D ). In addition, LY6E 160 enhanced the infection of IAVpp (Fig. 4D ). In agreement with our previous report, expression of 161 abolished the activity of LY6E to restrict the entry of human CoVs (Fig. 6 ). As anticipated, 180 N99A substitution that disrupts the addition of GPI anchor also abrogated the inhibitory effects 181 of LY6E on human CoV entry ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 In this study, we further demonstrated that AmphoB treatment also efficiently attenuated the 215 restriction of IFITM3 on the infection of SARS-CoVpp, MERS-CoVpp, HCoV-NL63pp, HCoV-216 229Epp and IAVpp, but not LASVpp (Fig. 8A ). However, AmphoB treatment altered neither the 217 restriction activity of LY6E on the infection of human CoV spike protein-pseudotyped 218 lentiviruses nor the enhancement of LY6E on IAVpp infection (Fig. 8B ). These results strongly 219 imply that LY6E modulates virus entry via a distinct mechanism. 220 221 DISCUSSION 222 223 LY6E was initially identified as a cell surface marker to discriminate immature from 224 mature thymocytes subsets (53). The primary function of LY6E has been associated with 225 immune regulation, specifically in modulating T cell activation, proliferation, development (54). 226
In addition to lymphocytes, LY6E mRNA can also be detected in liver, spleen, uterus, ovary, 227 lung, and brain and its expression can be induced by type I IFN in a cell-type specific manner 228 Second, in addition to GPI anchor, the evolutionally conserved amino acid residue L36 is 256 also required for both the enhancement and restriction of virus entry into target cells by LY6E 257 ( Fig. 6 ) (48). It can be speculated that this specific residue may mediate an interaction with other 258 cellular membrane proteins to module viral entry. The fact that LY6E enhances viral infectivity 259 in a cell type-specific manner, with the strongest phenotype in cells of fibroblast and monocytic 260 .

Variations in the 261 abundance of expression, as well as the localization of LY6E and its associated proteins or lipids, 262 may explain the differential effects of LY6E on the infection of different viruses in different cell 263 types ( Fig. 4 and 7) . However, LY6E enhancement of RNA virus infection appears to be 264 independent of type I interferon response and other ISG expression (48) CoV-2pp and HCoV-NL63pp, that share the ACE2 receptor, does not support such a hypothesis 282 (Fig. 4) . 283

Specifically, inhibition of TMPESS2-enhanced CoV entry 287 implies that LY6E most likely blocks virus entry at plasma membrane or in early endosomes. 288
Moreover, IFITMs impede viral fusion by decreasing membrane fluidity and curvature (37). 289
AmphoB can bind cholesterol in cell membranes to increase membrane fluidity and planarity and 290 consequentially rescue IFITM inhibition of virus entry (52). Interestingly, AmphoB only 291 neutralize the antiviral effects of IFITM2 and IFITM3, but has little effect on IFITM1 restriction 292 of virus entry (52). While IFITM1 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane or early 293 endosomes, IFITM2 and 3 are mainly localized in the later endosomes and lysosomes. Due to 294 their differential subcellular localization, IFITM1 mainly restricts the viruses that enter the cells 295 at cell surface or in the early endosomes, such as parainfluenza viruses and hepatitis C virus (59, 296 60), IFITM2 and 3 primarily restrict the infection of viruses that enter the cells at later 297 endosomes and/or lysosomes (43, 61, 62). Because AmphoB is endocytosed quite rapidly 298 leading to its concentration in the late endosomes and lysosomes, it more efficiently alleviates 299 the effect of IFITM2 and 3, but not IFITM1, on virus entry (52). Similarly, the failure of 300
AmphoB to attenuate the antiviral effects of LY6E against human CoVs is most likely due to its 301 predominant cell surface localization and inhibition of an early step of CoV entry. 302
In summary, while it is very interesting to know that LY6E is capable of modulating the 303 entry of many RNA viruses, we only begin to uncover the mechanism of this fascinating host 304 factor and define its pathobiological role in virus infection (41, 63) .
