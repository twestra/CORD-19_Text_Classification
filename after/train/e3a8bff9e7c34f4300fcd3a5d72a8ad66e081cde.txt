Background 50
The psychological impact of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 outbreak and related 51 lockdown measures among the Italian population are unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic is a 52 global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health, including 53 mental health (World Health Organization, 2020a; Xiang et al., 2020) . Since clusters of atypical 54 pneumonia of unknown etiology were discovered in the city of Whuan, Hubei province, in late 55
December 2019, the viral disease has continued to exponentially spread throughout China and 56
worldwide. Italy has been the first European country that had to face the pandemic. On March 9 th 57 2020, lockdown measures were enforced by the government on entire national territory. 58
Lockdown measures included travel restrictions, the mandatory closure of schools, nonessential 59 commercial activities and industries. People were asked to stay at home and socially isolate 60 themselves to prevent being infected. 61
As previously reported, health emergencies such as epidemic can lead to detrimental and long-62 lasting psychosocial consequences, due to disease related fear and anxiety, large-scale social 63
isolation, and the overabundance of (mis)information on social media and elsewhere (Dong and 64
Bouey, 2020). At the individual level, epidemics are associated with a wide range of psychiatric 65 comorbidities including anxiety, panic, depression and trauma-related disorders (Tucci et al., 66 2017) . The psychosocial impact of health emergences seems to be even higher during quarantine 67
measures (Brooks et al., 2020) . Quarantine has been associated with high stress levels 68 (DiGiovanni et al., 2004) , depression (Hawryluck et al., 2004) , irritability and insomnia (Lee et 69 al., 2005) . Furthermore, being quarantined is associated with acute stress (Bai et al., 2004) and 70 trauma-related (Wu et al., 2009 ) disorders, particularly in specific at-risk populations such as 71 health workers (Lai et al., 2020) . 72
Concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, a study on 1210 respondents in China found rates of 30% 73 of anxiety and 17% of depression (Wang et al., 2020) . Further, in a nationwide survey including 74 more than 50.000 Chinese respondents, almost 35% of the participants reported trauma-related 75 distress symptoms, with women and young adults showing significantly higher psychological 76 distress (Qiu et al., 2020) . 77
Together, these findings strongly suggest the need to accurately and timely assess the magnitude 78 of mental health outcomes in the general population exposed to COVID-19 pandemic, with 79 particular regard to the implementation of preventive and early interventions strategies for those at 80 higher risk. However, no study to date has investigated mental health outcomes and associated 81 risk factors in the Italian population. This could be of additional relevance considering the 82 implementation of the strict lockdown and social distancing measures imposed on the entire 83 national territory. 84
The aim of the current study was to assess rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general 85 population three to four weeks into lockdown measures and to explore the impact of COVID-19 86 related potential risk factors. This study aims at providing evidence that could potentially inform 87 subsequent research strategies and mental health delivery in Italy and Europe. 88 89

Participants were allowed to terminate the survey at any time they desired. The survey was 94
anonymous, and confidentiality of information was assured. 95
Data on mental health were collected between March 27 th and April 6 th 2020 using an on-line  96  questionnaire spread throughout the internet, using sponsored social network advertisement  97 together with a snowball recruiting technique. The investigated timeframe corresponds to the 98 contagion peak in Italy, according to epidemiogical data confirmed by the World Health 99
Organization (World Health Organization, 2020 Region of residence was inserted in order to account for the different incidence of COVID-19 136 among Italian regions. COVID-19 related independent variables were: 1) being under quarantine 137 either because infected or in close proximity to infected people; 2) any changes in working 138 activity compared to "working as usual" (e.g., smart-working, working activity discontinued due 139 to lockdown measures, higher workload due to ; 3) having a loved one infected, 140 hospitalized or deceased due to COVID-19; 4) any stressful events comprised in the IDAQ 141 checklist, purposely modified in order to capture only stressful events due to COVID-19. The 142
IADQ checklist comprises 8 questions about any potential stressful life event occurred in the 143 recent past, with a yes/no response, including financial, working, educational, housing, 144 relationship, own or loved one' s health and caregiving problems. In order to separate COVID-19 145 related stressful life events from non-COVID-19 related events, responses to the checklist were 146 modified as follows: "no"; "yes"; "yes, due to COVID-19". .

Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analyses are reported in In this study, we report for the first time on the mental health outcomes related to outbreak and related lockdown measures on the general population in Italy. To the best of our 207 knowledge, this is the first study to report on mental health outcomes related to the COVID-19 208 outbreak in Europe on such a large sample size. This study shows relatively high rates of PTSS, 209
Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, Perceived stress and ADS, with young women having higher odds 210 of endorsing a mental health outcome. These outcomes were associated with a number of COVID-211
19-related risk factors, including being under quarantine, having a loved one deceased by COVID-212
19, working activity discontinued due to lockdown measures, or experiencing other stressful 213 events (i.e. working, financial, relationship or housing problems) due to the pandemic or 214 lockdown measures. These findings were adjusted for previous psychiatric illness and a history of 215 childhood trauma, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic is exerting an independent effect on 216 the population mental health. 217 218
Compared to an early report on the mental health outcomes related to COVID-19 in China on 220 1210 respondents (Wang et al., 2020), we found lower rates of anxiety, similar rates of depression 221 and higher levels of perceived stress, notwithstanding differences in assessment tools. The 222
negative association with age and the positive association with female gender was confirmed, 223
suggesting that young women may be at heightened risk for mental disorders. Compared to 224

The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency that could 287
potentially have a serious impact on public health, including mental health. The psychological 288
impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and related lockdown measures among the Italian population 289 are unknown. In this web-based study, we report for the first time on the psychological impact of 290 COVID-19 outbreak on the general population in Italy. This study shows high rates of post-291 traumatic symptoms, Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, Perceived stress and Adjustment Disorder 292 associated with a number of COVID-19-related risk factors. This study represents the first 293
European report on mental health in the time of the COVID-19, and it could have a strong impact 294 on subsequent research and clinical intervention strategy for global mental health related to 295 COVID-19. 296 297 .
