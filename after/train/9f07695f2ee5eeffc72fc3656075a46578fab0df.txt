21 Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are a valuable animal model used in biomedical research.
22 Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, 23 and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To 24 overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We 25 provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal 26 changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female 27 ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were 28 weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the 29 winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, 30 while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals 31 varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated 32 with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such 33 that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average 34 weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water 35 regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight 36 changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water 37 regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative 38 benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into : bioRxiv preprint 42 of biomedical research areas, including: neuroscience [1-6], drug development [7] and 43 respiratory diseases such as Influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 44 [8,9] including the new coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 [10]. In laboratory animals 45 exposed to scientific procedures, a standard approach to monitoring health status is to 46 measure body weight. Weight loss is a key indicator of health problems, and therefore 47 understanding the factors that contribute to natural variation in body weight is critical for 48 correctly monitoring an animal's condition. Ferrets undergo significant variation in their 49 body weight seasonally; however, there is currently no normative data available to provide 50 a benchmark for the expected seasonal weight changes. Seasonal variations may mask 51 or exaggerate changes in body weight due to an experimental procedure or change in 52 health status and thus must be integrated into assessments of a ferret's health status. 53 Seasonal weight changes have been demonstrated in multiple species 54 independent of diurnality, including monkeys [11,12], raccoons [13], hamsters [14] and 55 rodents [15]. There are a range of potential factors that elicit seasonal weight changes, 56 but temperature and day length are key triggers, which are ultimately crucial for survival. 57 Ferrets are members of the mustelid family and have been domesticated from 58 European polecats, a species which was native to western Euroasia. Seasonal weight 59 changes have been observed in polecats and other closely related species such as mink. 60 These weight changes are seen as adaptations to the differing energy intake and 61 expenditure requirements of winter and summer [16,17]. In animal care facilities, daylight . 4 62 hours can be easily regulated and are often set at a 12-hour light cycle (12-hours ON, 12-63 hours OFF) or synchronised with the external environment; for example, varying from a 64 minimum 8-hour cycle in winter (8-hours ON, 16-hours OFF) to maximum 16-hour cycle 65 in summer (16-hours ON, 8-hours OFF) [18-21]. Variation in the photoperiod can change 66 factors such as eating habits, coat thickness, sleep and activity levels -all of which may 67 contribute to normal and possible abnormal weight changes. Previous research has 68 demonstrated that ferret weights increase as hours of daylight decrease, leading to 69 sinusoidal weight fluctuations with annual light cycle [22,23]. Contrastingly, in another 70 study where the sleep habits of two male ferrets were tracked, light/dark schedule was 71
shown to have no effect on their weight [24].
In addition to body weight, changes in photoperiod have also been linked to the 73 timing of the oestrus cycle, which occurs once per year in female ferrets [20,22,25,26].
74 One of the first studies showed that sexual activity in ferrets increased when light duration 75 or intensity increased [27]. Since then, further research has described ferret oestrus as 76 seasonal and photoperiod activated [28]. The relationship between photoperiod, oestrus 77 and body weight is unknown, but Donovan (1986) concluded that while there was not a 78 critical weight to trigger oestrus, oestrus does require a minimum weight of around 420g.
The aim of this study is to provide data on the normative weights of female ferrets, 80 accounting for seasonal changes over multiple years. In addition, we document changes 81 in weight that occur due to water regulation. We hypothesized that controlled light 82 exposure in animal care facilities would induce naturalistic fluctuations in the ferrets' body 83 weight.
Animals 93 The data from 39 healthy female pigmented ferrets (0.5 -4 years) were used for this 94 study. All animals underwent behavioural testing in psychoacoustic tasks that required 95 regulated access to water. Water was available during twice-daily testing sessions, with 96 supplementary wet food and/or water provided to ensure animals received a minimum of 97 60 ml/kg of water. Testing took place from Monday to Friday in, roughly, a three-weeks 98 on and one week off schedule. This ensured that ferrets did not experience water 99 regulation more than 50% of the time. When not participating in behavioural testing, 100 animals had free access to water. During testing periods, each animal was weighed daily 101 using digital scales (Salter, UK) prior to their morning testing session. Data was obtained
41 Domesticated ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are valuable animal models for a wide range 8 147 period is shown in Figure 1B . All ferrets conformed to a similar seasonal pattern of weight 148 change with weight greatest in April (when lights were altered to their summer day length) 149 and lowest in October (when the light cycle was switched to winter day lengths, Fig. 1C ).
150 The observed decreases in weight during the summer period and increases in weight 151 over the winter months, resulted in sinusoidal weight fluctuations over the two-year 152 measurement period. To quantify the observed changes in weight with season, we divided weight 162 measurements into 'summer' and 'winter' periods according to day length (summer = 14
163 hours daylight, winter = 8 hours daylight), considering time as the number of weeks since 164 the transition to longer/shorter days. For each animal and season for which we had at 165 least 8 weeks of data, we performed a linear regression to determine the relationship 166 between time (in weeks) and body weight ( Fig. 2A-B 182 Symbols indicate individual weight measurements; plotted according to the number of 183 weeks since the transition to summer light cycles.

Modelling the contribution of season and fluid regulation to body weight 226 To determine the relative contribution of season and water regulation duration on body 227 weight, we fitted General Linear Models to weight data, using the following predictors:

In 233 each case the best fitting mode retained each of the three main effects (week since 234 transition, day of water regulation and starting weight) as well as the two-way interaction 235 between the week and starting weight (see table 1 ). To illustrate the key features of these 236 models, we used the fitted models to simulate the changes in weight that would occur 237 over a 20-week period in summer and winter for animals of 750g and 900g (Fig. 4) .

While our models could recapitulate key trends in the data, and for some animals 253 the predicted and observed weights were closely aligned ( Figure 5A ), others were much 254 less well predicted (e.g. Figure 5B ). Moreover, to be useful as a diagnostic measure of 255 healthy or abnormal weight changes, the model should be able to estimate an expected 256 weight of an animal given factors such as the season and its starting weight. To test this, 257 and determine whether this model had any utility as a diagnostic measure, we applied the 258 regression model obtained by fitting data to all animals (above) to data from all but one 259 animal, excluding each animal in turn. We used the resulting model to predict weight 260 measurements (and their 99% confidence intervals) for the left-out animal's data and then 261 compare predicted and actual weight measurements. 
We found that that although predicted and observed weights were correlated 294 shows a rapid weight loss that stabilises at a baseline, whereas Animal F1705 continues to gain weight 295 after the weight change, before beginning to lose weight for the remainder of the season.
Given the observation that weight loss/gain with season could be fit as a linear 298 model ( Figure 2E ,F), but that there was significant inter-animal variation we adapted our 299 modelling approach to address three questions about the changes in body weight 300 between weeks that occurred with water regulation that were common across animals: .

As 312 before, data for summer and winter were modelled separately.
313 When modelling weight changes in the winter the intercept was significant (beta = 1.38, 314 table 2), suggesting that typically animals gained 1.38% of their body weight weekly in 315 winter, and the week was also a significant predictor (beta = -0.065) indicating that 316 animals initially gained weight more rapidly. In summer the intercept was again significant 317 (beta = -0.73) and the only other significant predictor was whether the animal had been 318 on regulation the previous week (beta = -0.82, indicating that animals who had access to 319 free water in the previous week lost more weight than those who had not had access to 320 free water). In summary therefore, it is possible to estimate typical patterns of weight loss 321 / gain that should occur over the course of a week but data such as that shown in Figure   322 6C,D demonstrate that each animal must really be assessed individually (ideally in 323 comparison to its own historic data) in the context of other factors.

In addition to body weight data, we also had the timing of oestrus for each animal 365 Depending on diet, water consumption for a ferret can be up to 100ml/day [29] and we 366 ensured ferrets received 60ml/kg of water each day of water restriction (which is the 367 amount that animals maintained on laboratory ferret diet, with free access to water, 368 typically consume in a 24 hour period). Since the key contributor to weight loss in water 369 regulated animals is thought to be reluctance to eat dry food (rather than dehydration per 370 se) providing animals with water combined with ground pellet diet to form a mash [8] 371 appears to be successful at ensuring weight loss does not exceed more than a few 372 percent. Food and water restriction are common methods used as motivation to train 373 many laboratory animals including ferrets, rats and mice in tasks for research [35] and 374 weight loss is a key marker of health status. Understanding how seasonal fluctuations 375 interact with these effects is therefore important to refine health assessment and ensure 376 the highest standards of animal welfare.
In addition to body weight data, we also had the timing of oestrus for each animal 
While the seasonal and water-regulation induced changes in weight were highly 399 stereotyped within an animal, and had common features across animals, we were unable 400 to generate a simple statistical model that could accurately predict the expected weight 401 changes. Pulling together our findings we would expect that animals should gain weight 402 in winter, with an initial increase of around roughly 1.4%/week, declining to 0.7%/week 403 after 10 weeks and 0.1%/week after 20 weeks. In contrast, expected weight loss in the 404 summer was roughly linear, with animals losing roughly 0.7%/week, except in weeks 405 which were preceded by access to free water in which weight loss was around 1.5%.
406 Superimposed upon these weekly changes are daily fluctuations in body weight that result 407 from fluid regulation which are typically of the order of 3-4% from a Monday morning to 408 Friday morming. These data therefore establish some normative benchmarks for 409 seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated along with other 410 indicators of well-being into the assessment of an animal's overall condition.
