concentrations of particulate matter, which are already known to have negative effects on human health. [3] Regional figures are available for Italy at the date of April 12 th show that about 30% of currently positive people still live in Lombardy (about 40% if considering the overall cases confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic), followed by Emilia Romagna (13.5% of currently positive people), Piedmont (10.5%), and Veneto (10%). [2] These four regions of the Po Valley account for 80% of total deaths recorded in Italy and 65% of Intensive Care Units admissions. [2] A research carried out by the Harvard School of Public Health seems to confirm an association between increases in PM concentrations and mortality rates due to COVID-19. [4] .

However, the issue of airborne PM-associated microbiome, especially in urban environments, remains largely under-investigated [16] , and -at the presentnobody has still carried out experimental studies specifically aimed at confirming or excluding the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 on PM.
Here, we present the first results of the analyses that we have performed on 34 PM10 samples of outdoor/airborne PM10 from an industrial site of Bergamo Province, collected with two air samplers (POS1 and POS2) over a continuous 3-weeks period, from February 21 st to March 13 th . University. Given the "environmental" nature of the sample, presumably rich in inhibitors of DNA polymerases, we proceeded with the extraction of RNA by using the Quick RNA fecal soil microbe kit adapted to the type of the filters. [18] Half filter was rolled, with the top side facing inward, in a 5 ml polypropylene tube, together with the beads provided in the kit. From the initial 1 ml of lysis buffer, we were able to get about 400 ul of solution, which was then processed as defined by the standard protocols, resulting in a final eluate of 15 ul. Subsequently, 5 ul were used for the SARS-CoV-2 testing.
Given the particular origin of the sample, the qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix was used. The test was explicitly aimed at confirming or excluding the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter. The first analysis used the "E gene" as a molecular marker and produced an impressive positive result on 15 out of 16 filters even if, as we could expect, the Ct was between 36-38 cycles. After that, we have replicated the analysis on 6 of the positive filters (already positive to "E gene") by using the "RtDR gene" as a molecular marker -which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2reaching 5 significant results of positivity; control tests to exclude false positivity were also successfully .

To avoid the running out of the scarce sampling material available, the remaining extracted RNAs were delivered to the local University Hospital (one of the clinical centres authorized by the Italian Government for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests), in order to perform a second parallel blind test. This second clinical laboratory tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 7 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers (Tab. 1). Because of the nature of the sample, and considering that the sampling has not been carried out for clinical diagnostic purposes but for environmental pollution tests (taking also into account that filters were stored for at least four weeks before undergoing molecular genetic analyses, as a consequence of the Italian shutdown), we can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by detecting highly specific "RtDR gene" on 8 filters. However, due to the lack of additional materials from the filters, we were not able to repeat enough number of tests to show positivity for all the 3 molecular markers simultaneously. This is the first preliminary evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on outdoor particulate .
