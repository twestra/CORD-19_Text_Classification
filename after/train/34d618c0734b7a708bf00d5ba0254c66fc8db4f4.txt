The miniaturization of real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using 19 drop-based microfluidics, or droplet qPCR, allows for quantification of single nucleic acids. The 20 nucleic acids are compartmentalized into aqueous microdroplets, picoliters in volume, separated 21 by an immiscible oil, and stabilized by a surfactant. In droplet qPCR, accurate data can only be 22 obtained if the drops remain stable to coalescence upon thermocycling and drop contents do not 23 diffuse to neighboring drops. In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying 24 influenza A virus (IAV) following systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the 25 optimal combination of Tween-20 / BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye 26 diffusion. We use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of 27 hundreds of thousands of drops and correlate this data with constructed amplification curves 28 obtained from hundreds of drops sampled at various cycle numbers and imaged using 29 epifluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we tested a range of in 30 vitro transcribed M gene and IAV viral supernatant from infected cells. We directly amplified 31 IAV genomes from infected supernatant without an RNA extraction step. Our droplet qPCR 32 assay enables detection of IAV down to 0.274 cpd, or a single viral genome per drop, 33 establishing the high sensitivity and precision of our method. 34 35 36 37 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The most common 71 additives used for droplet PCR assays are polyethylene glycol (PEG), Tween-20, bovine serum 72 albumin (BSA), and betaine; yet systematic testing of the effect of these additives is critically 73 lacking and, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported. Systematic testing would 74 provide an optimized set of additives for droplet qPCR by improving drop stability during 75 thermocycling and limiting transport of small molecules between drops. 76
Here, we investigate a range of additives for optimizing droplet quantitative reverse 77 transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and enabling quantification of influenza A virus (IAV) in 100 µm 78 diameter drops. Additive combinations of PEG, Tween-20, BSA, and betaine were screened for 79 their ability to stabilize drops from coalescence and limit diffusion between neighboring drops. 80
Together with 3 wt% (w/w) of PEG-PFPE2 surfactant 13 in the oil phase, an additive combination 81 of 1% w/v Tween-20, 0.8 µg/µl BSA, and 1 M betaine in a standard qRT-PCR mixture was 82 found to be optimal for stabilizing drops and limiting dye diffusion under qPCR thermocycling 83 between 60 °C and 95 °C. Using Tween-20 / BSA / betaine as additives, five orders of 84 magnitude of in vitro transcribed viral RNA was resolved between drops ranging from 10 -1 to 85 10 4 copies per drop (cpd). Drops containing low (10 1 cpd) and high (10 4 cpd) viral RNA 86 concentrations were thermocycled using a standard qPCR machine and the qRT-PCR 87 amplification curves were comparable to constructed curves obtained from drops sampled at 88 various cycles using epifluorescence microscopy. The optimized droplet qRT-PCR assay was 89 used to quantify the number of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) IAV genomes present in the 90 supernatant from infected A549 cells. At 24 hours post infection (hpi), we prepared six dilutions 91 of supernatant from infected cells to determine our detection limit for live virus. Using ddPCR 92 analysis, we were able to quantify IAV RNA directly from infected cells across four orders of 93 magnitude. We find that our limit of detection is at a dilution that corresponds to 0.274 cpd, 94 demonstrating that we are able to detect down to a single viral genome in a drop. In addition, we 95 amplified viral RNA from supernatant collected directed from infected cells without an RNA 96 extraction step. This direct PCR method will have impact in reducing the number of steps for 97 future work performing droplet qPCR of viruses. 98 99 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Screening of qRT-PCR additives to stabilize drops and reduce dye diffusion during 230 thermocycling 231
To probe how different PCR additives impact drop stability and dye diffusion during 232 thermocycling, we measured the effect of Tween-20, BSA, PEG-6K, and betaine individually 233 and in different combinations in a droplet qRT-PCR assay with 3 wt% (w/w) of PEG-PFPE2 234 surfactant. To analyze drop stability, drop diameters D were measured post thermocycling from 235 epifluorescence images. To quantify dye diffusion, fluorescence intensities of a thermally stable 236 reference dye (ROX) that is present in all droplet qPCR assays was measured post thermocycling 237 from epifluorescence images. All of the droplet qRT-PCR assays were optimized for TaqMan-238 based chemistry to detect and quantify in vitro transcribed M gene RNA from IAV. The M gene 239 is a standard target for IAV detection due to its conserved nature across different IAV species. 21, 240 28 Drops were produced from a solution of qRT-PCR reaction master mix, probe and primers, 241 enzymes and 10 7 copies/µL (~170 cpd) of M gene template. This represents the qRT-PCR 242 reaction mixture with no additives. To test different PCR additives, the qRT-PCR reaction 243 mixture was supplemented with each of the following: BSA, PEG-6K, betaine, Tween-20, 244
Tween-20 / PEG-6K, Tween-20 / BSA, or Tween-20 / BSA / betaine. PEG enhances PCR 245 reactions due to its ability to act as a macromolecular crowding agent, thereby increasing DNA 246 polymerase activity. 29 In drops, PEG has been shown to improve the stability of drops containing 247 high salt content which can occur in standard PCR reaction mix. 30-32 BSA is a common PCR 248 additive and has been shown previously to limit dye diffusion between drops. 33, 34 Tween-20 has 249 been utilized as an additional surfactant 8, 35, 36 and acts to reduce surface tension in drops while 250 betaine improves PCR amplification of GC rich regions by reducing the formation of nucleic 251 acid secondary structure. 37-39 252
The drops containing 10 7 copies/µL of M gene template were thermocycled on a standard 253 qPCR machine with a 30-minute reverse transcriptase step followed by 40 cycles of PCR. Drops 254 were imaged on an epifluorescence microscope following thermocycling in order to assess drop 255 stability from coalescence and retention of the ROX dye. The images of drops that contained no 256 additives, BSA alone, PEG-6K alone, or betaine alone show extensive coalescence with multiple 257 different drop sizes in each image (Fig. 1A) . Diameters D were compared to the initial drop 258 diameter D0 before thermocycling of drops with no PCR additives. Normalized diameters (D-259 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In addition to drop stability, we also investigated the retention of ROX reference dye 279 within drops after thermocycling. The fluorescence intensity I of ROX in each of the 280 epifluorescence images was normalized by subtracting the background signal IB. The normalized 281 ROX fluorescence intensity of each drop, I-IB, was measured to quantify diffusion of the dye 282 from the drops (Fig. 1C) . A lower value of I-IB indicates that the ROX dye diffused out of the 283 drops and not between neighboring drops. To verify this, we measured the background 284 fluorescence of the oil surrounding the drops and found that the background fluorescence 285 intensity was highest for the no additive condition (Fig. S2) , indicating that the additives tested 286
here had a positive effect on ROX dye retention in drops during thermocycling. 287
A narrow ROX I-IB within drops (smaller CV) is ideal for normalizing the TaqMan probe 288 signal that is produced during thermocycling. In addition, a high I-IB indicates that the dye is not 289 diffusing out of the drops.

With no additives, I-IB of the ROX dye 291 was 33.6 a.u., the lowest of all eight conditions tested, and indicates a loss of ROX dye from the 292 drops during thermocycling. Based on our data, Tween-20 and the Tween-20 / BSA / betaine 293 combination maintained the best drop stability post thermocycling. In terms of ROX dye 294 retention, Tween-20 had the highest I-IB of 99.6 a.u. (Fig. 1C, red box) compared to Tween-20 / 295 BSA / betaine with a I-IB of 89.7 a.u. (Fig. 1C, orange box) . However, the Tween-20 / BSA / 296 betaine condition resulted in a smaller CV (15.9%) of I-IB than the Tween-20 condition (18.5%). 297
Based on our results, droplet qRT-PCR reactions that contain an additive combination of Tween-298 20 / BSA / betaine have the lowest change in drop diameters following thermocycling with 299 relatively high overall ROX fluorescence intensity and the lowest CV of the fluorescence 300 intensity.

To evaluate the reaction efficiency of our droplet qRT-PCR reaction with the optimized 319 additives Tween-20 / BSA / betaine, we performed a dilution series of RNA in drops and as bulk 320
reactions. PCR is based on the principle that amplification begins in an exponential growth phase 321 at early thermocycles before the reaction products become exhausted. This exponential phase 322 corresponds to a reaction efficiency of 100%, where all DNA is multiplied by a factor of two at 323 the completion of every cycle. Desired amplification efficiencies should fall between 90-324 110%. 42, 43 PCR efficiencies that fall outside of this range will limit dynamic range and 325 sensitivity. A dilution series of a known quantity of target RNA or DNA is required to create a 326 standard curve to relate cycle threshold (Ct) values to the common logarithm (log10) of the RNA 327 or DNA concentration. When a standard curve has a slope of -3.33, it indicates that the PCR 328 reaction efficiency is 100%. To perform a standard curve in drops, in vitro transcribed IAV M 329 gene RNA was added as template to the optimized qRT-PCR reaction mix with additives Tween-330 20 / BSA / betaine. Serial RNA dilutions of a range of 10 4 to 10 9 copies/µL in bulk were 331 generated, corresponding to a range of 10 -1 to 10 4 cpd. The amplification curves obtained using 332 qPCR in bulk (Fig. S3) follow the same trend as in drops (Fig. 2A) . The Ct values for the 333 dilution series in drops and in bulk were plotted to generate standard curves for both reactions 334 (Fig. 2B) . The slopes of the curves yield a droplet reaction efficiency of 90.3% compared to a 335 bulk reaction efficiency of 98.9%, with both falling within the desired 90-110% range (Fig. 2B) . 336
We hypothesize that the lower efficiency in the droplet reactions compared to bulk is due to 337 sequestration of reagents within the drops, resulting in a slightly reduced ability to fully amplify 338 the DNA over 40 cycles before exhaustion of required reaction reagents. 339
An end-point measurement of the drop fluorescence can be performed either with 340 epifluorescence microscopy or custom flow-based detection methods. 1, 2, 24 Here, we used 341 epifluorescence microscopy. Drops from the dilution series in Fig 2A were imaged on an 342 epifluorescence microscope after 40 PCR cycles. Representative images of FAM and ROX 343 signals in drops containing 10 4 (Fig. 2C) and 10 -1 (Fig. 2D ) RNA cpd are shown. As expected, 344 the 10 4 cpd case resulted in all bright drops due to the high concentration of RNA amplified in 345 each drop, while the 10 -1 cpd case resulted in a combination of bright and dark drops due to the 346 limiting dilution of RNA.

Poisson statistics was used to 348 fit the fraction of positive drops from the dilution series images, following Eq. 1: 349
where λ is the average copy numbers of target RNA and p is the fraction of positive drops. 1 The 351 percentage of amplified drops demonstrated good agreement with Poisson statistics (Fig. 2E , 352 Table S2 ).

Concentration of nucleic acid present within a sample can be determined using qRT-376 PCR. In the prior section, we introduced a novel method for testing qRT-PCR additives to obtain 377 amplification curves across five orders of magnitude of M gene RNA in drops. Here, we 378 performed a high-resolution investigation of two concentrations of M gene in drops undergoing 379 real-time PCR amplification. We studied drops containing low (10 1 cpd) and high (10 4 cpd) viral 380 RNA by sampling drops at various cycle numbers on the qRT-PCR machine and imaging under 381 epifluorescence microscopy. We obtained real-time PCR amplification curves from the 382 thermocycled drops in the qPCR machine and compared these curves to constructed 383 amplification curves arising from hundreds of individual drops imaged using epifluorescence 384 microcopy. 385
Amplifying RNA within drops on a standard qPCR machine generated amplification 386 curves of all the drops contained within the sample tube, approximately 300,000 drops. The 387 qPCR machine tracks fluorescence amplification of all drops in the tube at each cycle number 388 between 0 to 40, which we call continuous data. We sampled hundreds of randomly sampled 389 drops imaged on an epifluorescence microscope over multiple thermocycles, which we call 390 discontinuous data. This allowed us to construct amplification curves using microscopy that 391 resembled the real-time continuous measurements performed on the standard qPCR machine. 392
Thermocycling drops within the qPCR machine without interruption generated a continuous 393 amplification curve (Fig. 3A, green solid line) and is representative of a bulk sample (Fig. S3) . 394
By contrast, a discontinuous amplification curve was produced by imaging drops from individual 395 tubes at specific cycles on an epifluorescence microscope (Fig. 3A, blue dashed line) . Drops 396 from the low RNA loading condition were analyzed across eight cycles (cycle 1, 20, 22, 24, 26, 397 28, 30, and 40) (Fig. 3A) . Cycle 1 provides a baseline fluorescence measurement. At cycle 20, 398 the amplification curve begins to increase exponentially. Drops are then imaged after every two 399 cycles from cycle 20 to 30 to capture the exponential region of the amplification curve. A final 400 endpoint measurement is taken at cycle 40. The normalized fluorescence data from the 401 epifluorescence images (Fig. 3A, blue dashed line) are plotted for each cycle measured and 402 produce a curve similar to that of the qPCR machine (Fig. 3A, green solid line) , validating that 403 an amplification curve can be constructed from the discontinuous epifluorescence data.

As amplification starts to 406 increase at cycle 20, the distribution of drops shifts to the right as the fluorescence increases. 407
From cycle 20 to 30, we observed that a majority of the drops began to amplify while a small 408 population did not (Fig. 3B, arrow, cycle 40) , forming a bimodal distribution. We hypothesize 409 that this small population of non-amplifying drops did not contain template RNA. This would 410 indicate that the 1.7 x 10 1 cpd loading was an overestimate as empty drops are not expected at 411 this concentration. In comparison, the high RNA loading condition (1.7 x 10 4 cpd) should result 412 in every drop containing RNA, with all drops amplifying in unison, and should not result in a 413 bimodal distribution as observed with the low RNA loading condition. To test this, drops 414 containing 1.7 x 10 4 RNA cpd were imaged at 0, 10, 15 and 40 cycles (Fig. 3C) . As with the low 415 RNA loading condition, the normalized fluorescence data from the high RNA loading condition 416 epifluorescence images produced a curve (Fig. 3C , red dashed line) similar to that of the qPCR 417 machine (Fig. 3C, orange line) . The distributions of drop fluorescence at each cycle for the high 418 RNA loading condition are presented in Fig 3D. 419
As discrete particles such as RNA are encapsulated into drops following a Poisson 420 distribution, 24 we predicted the high RNA loading condition (1.7 x 10 4 cpd) would create a tight 421 distribution (CV = 0.77%) while the low RNA loading condition (1.7 x 10 1 cpd) would create a 422 wide distribution (CV = 24.3%) of RNA between drops, respectively. The CV is calculated as 423 4 " # , as defined by the Poisson distribution, where λ is the RNA loading in cpd. The high RNA 424 loading condition resulted in all drops amplifying as predicted. In addition, the fluorescence 425 intensities of the high loading RNA condition showed tighter distributions at all cycles compared 426 to the amplified drops in the low RNA loading conditions. Representative images of drops for 427 both 1.7 x 10 1 and 1.7 x 10 4 cpd at early and late cycles provide a visual reference for the 428 distributions in the histograms (Fig. 3E) . The similar trend of drop measurements between the 429 qPCR machine and the epifluorescence images demonstrates that RNA concentrations in 430 individual drops can be extrapolated from real-time PCR amplification curves produced by either 431 standard qPCR thermocycling or epifluorescence microscopy. These methods can therefore be 432 utilized to determine nucleic acid concentrations from a large population of drops without the 433 need for custom flow-based methods. 1, 2, 24 434 435 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Following successful amplification of in vitro transcribed RNA, we applied our 461 optimized droplet qRT-PCR assay to quantify the number of IAV genomes present in the 462 supernatant from infected cells using ddPCR analysis. We infected A549 supernatant results in every drop amplifying after 40 cycles (Fig. 4B) . In comparison, a 10 -2 484 dilution of supernatant, which we estimated to contain 1.75 cpd, results in a majority of drops 485 amplifying (77%) with a few that remain dark (Fig. 4C) . The lowest 10 -5 dilution of supernatant 486 from infected cells is similar to supernatant from mock infected cells and is therefore 487 representative of background amplification (Fig. 4D and E) . Our limit of detection was reached 488 at a 10 -3 dilution level, in which N+/Ntotal was measured to be 0.274 cpd.

In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying IAV following 508 systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the optimal combination of Tween-20 / 509 BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye diffusion. We demonstrate, for the first 510 time, the ability to use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of 511 hundreds of thousands of drops. We correlate this data with hundreds of drops sampled using 512 epifluorescence microscopy. Measurements of real-time PCR amplification in drops using a 513 standard qPCR machine or epifluorescence microscope can eliminate the need for complicated 514 custom microfluidic thermocycling devices 3-5 . As qPCR machines and epifluorescence 515 microscopes are common instruments in many laboratories, this method can be used to 516 systematically test droplet qPCR additives for quantifying genomes within a large population of 517 drops. 518
We tested a wide concentration range of both in vitro transcribed viral RNA and viral 519 supernatant from infected cells in drops. Our optimized droplet qPCR assay enabled 520 quantification of 10 -1 to 10 4 cpd of in vitro transcribed IAV M gene. To further demonstrate the 521 utility of our method, we quantified viral IAV genomes from infected cells. Using ddPCR, we 522 measured IAV RNA over four orders of magnitude down to 0.274 cpd, or a single viral genome 523 per drop. This demonstrates the high sensitivity and precision of our droplet qPCR assay. 524 Importantly, our work establishes the ability to directly amplify viral RNA without the need for 525 RNA extraction and with very little reagent, which is advantageous in challenging resource-526 limited situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our findings will have great 527 impact in future studies for accurately quantifying viral genomes using droplet qPCR. 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535
