Objectives: 30 SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis is challenging in patients from 2-3 weeks after the 31 onset of symptoms, due to the low positivity rate of the PCR. Serologic tests could be 32 complementary to PCR in these situations. The aim of our study was to analyze the 33 diagnostic performance of one serologic rapid test in COVID-19 patients. 34 Methods: 35 We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COVID-19 IgG / IgM) which 36 detects IgG and IgM antibodies. We validated the serologic test using serum samples 37 from 45 negative patients (group 1) and 55 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR 38 (group 2). Then, we prospectively evaluated the test in 63 patients with clinical 39 diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology that were COVID-19 negative by PCR 40 (group 3).
The pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 that started in Wuhan four months ago (1,2) has 59 caused until April 8, 2020, a total of 1,353,361 cases and 79,235 deaths worldwide (3) . 60 Spain is the country of the European region that has been most affected by the 61 infection, accounting for 140,510 cases and 13,798 deaths by April 8 (3) . From the 62 beginning of the pandemic, one of the main concerns was the complexity and These limitations have led to development of different microplate ELISA tests (11, 12) . 81 Recently published studies confirm the usefulness of combining PCR in 82 nasopharyngeal exudates with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the blood 83 (13).

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first evaluation of this serologic rapid test 243 which has complete data on the time from the onset of symptoms. As this is a 244 serological test, this kind of information is key in order to interpret properly the 245 sensitivity and specificity results. Additionally, in our experience, the use of these tests 
Our study is subject to some limitations. First, it has been conducted in a single 252 hospital. Further multicenter studies are necessary to reinforce our findings. Second, 253 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The question about the reliability of serologic rapid tests is still under debate 265 (18,19) and more research is needed on this topic. We think that our study may help to 266 point out the usefulness of these rapid tests. 278 The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
