Identifying transcriptional responses that are most consistently associated with 16 experimental coronavirus (CoV) infection can help illuminate human cellular signaling 17 pathways impacted by CoV infection. Here, we distilled over 3,000,000 data points from 18 publically archived CoV infection transcriptomic datasets into consensus regulatory 19 signatures, or consensomes, that rank genes based on their transcriptional 20 responsiveness to infection of human cells by MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 21 subtypes. We computed overlap between genes with elevated rankings in the CoV 22 consensomes against those from transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq consensomes for nearly 23 880 cellular signaling pathway nodes. Validating the CoV infection consensomes, we 24 identified robust overlap between their highly ranked genes and high confidence targets 25 of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. We then developed a 26 series of use cases that illustrate the utility of the CoV consensomes for hypothesis 27 generation around mechanistic aspects of the cellular response to CoV infection. We 28 make the CoV infection consensomes and their universe of underlying data points freely 29 accessible through the Signaling Pathways Project web knowledgebase. : bioRxiv preprint Josset et al., 2013; Sims et al., 2013; Yoshikawa et al., 2010). To date however the field 55 has lacked a resource that fully capitalizes on these datasets by, firstly, using them to 56 rank human genes according to their transcriptional response to CoV infection and 57 secondly, contextualizing these transcriptional responses by integrating them with 58 'omics data points relevant to host cellular signaling pathways. Here, as a service to the 59 research community to catalyze the development of novel CoV therapeutics, we 60 generated consensomes for infection of human cells by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 61 CoVs. We then analyzed the extent to which high confidence transcriptional targets for 62 these viruses intersected with genes with elevated rankings in transcriptomic and ChIP-63 Seq consensomes for cellular signaling pathway nodes. Integration of the CoV 64 consensomes with the existing universes of SPP transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data 65 points in a series of use cases illuminates previously uncharacterized intersections 66 between CoV infection and human cellular signaling pathways. The CoV infection 67 consensome and its underlying datasets provide researchers with a unique and freely 68 accessible framework within which to generate and pressure test hypotheses around 69 human cellular signaling pathways impacted by CoV infection.
70 75 We first set out to generate a set of consensomes ranking human genes based on the 76 frequency of their significant differential expression in response to infection by MERS, 77 SARS1 and SARS2 CoVs. To do this we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus 78 (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases to identify datasets involving infection of human 79 cells by these species. From this initial collection of datasets, we next carried out a 80 three step quality control check as previously described (Ochsner et al., 2019), yielding 81 a total of 3,041,047 million data points in 111 experiments from 25 independent CoV 82 infection transcriptomic datasets (Supplementary information, Section 1). Using these 83 curated datasets, we next generated consensomes for each CoV species, as well as 84 one ranking genes across all CoV infection experiments (ALL CoV). As a reference 85 consensome for a virus whose transcriptional impact on human cells has been studied 86 in depth, we also generated a consensome for human influenza A virus (IAV) infection. 87 The Supplementary information files contain the full human ALL CoV (Section 2), MERS 88 (Section 3), SARS1 (Section 4), SARS2 (Section 5) and IAV (Section 6) infection 89 transcriptomic consensomes. To assist researchers in inferring transcriptional regulation 90 of signaling networks, the ALL CoV consensome is annotated to indicate the identity of 91 a gene as encoding a bioactive small molecule, receptor, signaling enzyme or 92 transcription factor (Supplementary information, Section 2, columns W-Z). As an initial 93 benchmark for the ALL CoV consensome, we assembled a list of 20 interferon-94 stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode many of the key canonical viral response 95 factors (Supplementary information, Section 2, column I) (Schneider et al., 2014).

Generation of the CoV consensomes
Infection by coronaviruses (CoV) represents a major current global public health 33 concern. Signaling within and between airway epithelial and immune cells in response 34 to infections by CoV and other viruses is coordinated by a complex network of signaling (Haviv et al., 1998) . TC95s remained specific to SARS2 (data not shown), confirming that significant overlap 330 with the EMT node signature was specific to the SARS2 TC99. 331 We next applied consensome redundancy analysis (see Use case 1) to isolate a set of 332 SARS2 regulated genes (CPV P < 0.05) that were high confidence targets (i.e. in the The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted April 25, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059527 doi: bioRxiv preprint 20 appreciation of the cellular signaling pathway nodes whose gain or loss of function in 400 response to CoV infection gives rise to these transcriptional patterns.
