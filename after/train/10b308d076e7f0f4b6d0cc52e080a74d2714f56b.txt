The new coronavirus disease, officially known as COVID-19, originated in China in 2019 and 35 has since spread around the globe. We presented a modified Susceptible-Latent-Infected-36
as 30, 11591, 7716, 3143, 1408 and 89 with mortality ratios nearly 0.67%, 11.39%, 8.77%, 76 1,9%, 6.4% and 1.2% respectively [1] . Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of confirmed The highest burden of COVID-19 is not only dependent on the health system but also depend 83 quickly response. For example, in Italy, the first confirmed COVID-19 cases on February 15 84 and then after few days thousands of people infected by COVID-19. The problem is not that 85 the Italy government didn't respond to the COVID-19. The problem is that it always responded 86 slightly too slow and with slightly too much moderation. What has resulted in China reveals 87 that quarantine, social distance, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic. 88 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is advocating for many countries where 89 COVID-19 is starting to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement 90 the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which 91 .

The number of individuals who become infected per unit time is called the 107 incidence rate in the epidemiology perspective [11] . Here, we consider the nonlinear incidence The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents model descriptions. Sections 122 We considered a modified SLIR compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission with 123 nonlinear incidence between the following mutually exclusive compartments: S(t)susceptible 124 .

Given non-negative initial conditions for the system above, it is straightforward to show that 154 each of the state variables remain non-negative for all t > 0. Moreover, summing equations 155 (1)-(4) we find that the size of the total population, N(t) satisfies 163 In this section we estimated the model parameters based on the available six countries COVID-164 19 reported cases data from the worldometers.info [1] .

Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the parameters that process the greatest 197 influence on the model outputs [20, 21] . In this study, we performed the partial rank correlation 
In this paper, we presented a modified SLIR compartmental model with nonlinear incidence. 214 We estimate number of cases from COVID-19 infection and apply it to data from the COVID- Within the six different countries we found that Spain has the highest transmission rate than 221 the other selected countries, which may be increase massive number of COVID-19 cases and 222 make worst situation in Spain.

Respiratory hygiene is important because droplets 240 spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you catch any droplets that might be In this country, health system is very poor which leads to the fewer number of reported cases.
Therefore, data from other countries, in particular the number of cases by date of COVID-19 249 onset is necessary to better understand the variability in cases across settings. are to reduce contact rates as well as increase the treatment rate that will be most effective way CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
