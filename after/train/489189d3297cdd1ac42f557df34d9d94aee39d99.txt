Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most closely 2 related, by average genetic distance, to two coronaviruses isolated from bats, RaTG13 and 3 RmYN02. However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-4
CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 5 the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent 6 amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the 7 synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid 8 divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the 9 synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than 10 between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for 11 the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin 12 strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent 13 recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also 14 find a 14-fold increase in the d N /d S ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the 15 strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous 16 mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral 17 fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-18
CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% 19 a coronavirus (Lu, et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020), Severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus with a 29,891 bp genome consisting of four major 2 structural genes (Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). Of particular relevance to this study 3 is the spike protein which is responsible for binding to the primary receptor for the virus, 4 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wan, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 5 2020). 6
Human SARS-CoV-2 is related to a coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from the bat 7
Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province of China (Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). RaTG13 and the 8 human strain reference sequence (Genbank accession number MN996532) are 96.2% identical 9
and it was first argued that, throughout the genome, RaTG13 is the closest relative to human 10 SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou, et al. 2020 showed that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 11 were 91.02% and 90.55% identical ,respectively, to coronaviruses isolated from pangolins 12 (Pangolin-CoV), which therefore form a close outgroup to the SARS-CoV-2+RaTG13 clade . 13 Furthermore, five key amino acids in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike were identical 14 between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, but differed between those two strains and RaTG13. 15 (Lam, et al. 2020) independently made similar observations and additionally showed that when 16 analyzing a window of length 582bp in the RBD, nonsynonymous mutations support a 17 phylogenetic tree with SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV as sister-groups, while synonymous 18 mutations do not. They discuss two possible explanations for their results, one which includes 19 recombination and another which includes selection-driven convergent evolution. Boni, et al. 20 2020 found little evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV using the 21 recombination analysis software 3SEQ (Lam, et al. 2018), but argued that if there has been 22 recombination, it likely occurred into RaTG13 from an unknown divergent source. This would 23 explain the amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV in the RBD as an 24
ancestral trait that has been lost (by recombination) in RaTG13. Using a phylogenetic analysis 25 they also dated the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 divergence to be between 40 to 70 years. 26
The Covid19 pandemic is perhaps the biggest public health and economic threat that the world 23 has faced for decades (Li, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020 ; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020 ). It is caused by 24 cleandata = 1". To obtain bootstrap values, we bootstrapped the multiple sequence alignments 1 1,000 times, repeating the inference procedure for each bootstrap sample. The NJ tree was 2 estimated using the 'neighbor' software from the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein 2009 where potential recombination was detected for the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Supplementary Table  12 5). of genome-wide divergence between RaTG13 and human strains, we fix d S at 0.1609 (the 24 maximum likelihood estimate outside the RBD region reported in the Results section).

The estimates in 300-bp windows were further bias-7 corrected as described below. 8 9
Bias correction for d S estimates in 300-bp window: To correct for the biases observed in the 10 estimation of d S (see results section) we identifed a quartic function which maps from ! , the 11 estimates of d S , into ! * , the bias corrected estimate such that to a close approximation, [ ! *] 12 = d S . To identify the coefficients of this function we used 10,000 simulations as previously 13 described, on a grid of d S values (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, ..., 3.0). We then identified coefficients such 14 that sum of ( [ ! *] -d S ) 2 is minimized over all simulation values. 15
To identify possible viral strains that may have contributed, by recombination, to the formation of 19 human SARS-CoV-2, we searched NCBI and EMBL virus entries along with GISAID Epiflu and 20
EpiCov databases for similar sequences using BLAST in 100bp windows stepping every 10bp 21 (Fig. 1B) . The majority of the genome (78.1%, 2330/2982 of the windows) has one unique best 22 hit, likely reflecting the high genetic diversity of the coronavirus. 21.9% of the genomic regions 23 has multiple best hits, which suggests that these regions might be more conserved. Among the 24 windows with unique best hits, 97.0% (2260/2330) of them were the RaTG13 or RmYN02 bat 25 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

These observations are consistent with previous results that 2 RaTG13 and RmYN02 are the most closely related viral strains, while the region containing the 3 ACE2 contact residues is more closely related to the pangolin virus strains. We investigate this issue using estimates of synonymous divergence per synonymous site (d S ) 20 in sliding windows of 300 bp. However, estimation of d S is complicated by the high levels of 21 divergence and extremely skewed nucleotide content in the 3rd position of the sequences 22 (Table 1) which will cause a high degree of homoplasy. We, therefore, entertain methods for 23 estimation that explicitly account for unequal nucleotide content and multiple hits in the same 24 site such as maximum likelihood methods and the YN00 method . 25

However, it is unclear in the current case how best to 2 estimate d S . For this reason, we performed a small simulations study (see Methods) for 3 evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of d N and d S (as 4 implemented in codeml (Yang 2007) ) under the F3x4 model and the YN00 method implemented 5 in PAML. In general, we find that estimates under the YN00 are more biased with slightly higher 6 MSE than the ML estimate for values in the most relevant regime of d S < 1.5 (Fig. 3) . However, 7
we also notice that both estimators are biased under these conditions. For this reason, we 8 perform a bias correction calibrated using simulations specific to the nucleotide frequencies and 9 d N /d S ratio observed for SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods). The bias corrections we obtain are ! * = 10
Notice that there is a trade-off between mean and variance ( Fig. 3) so that 12 the MSE becomes very large, particularly for the for yn00 method, after bias correction. For d S 13 >2 the estimates are generally not reliable, however, we note that for d S <1.5 the bias-corrected 14 ML estimator tends overall to have slightly lower MSE, and we, therefore, use this estimator for 15 analyses of 300 bp regions. 16 (95% C.I., 0.1340-0.1584) and d S = 0.1117 (95% C.I., 0.1019-0.1215) between SARS-CoV-2 1 and RaTG13 and RmYN02, respectively. This confirms that RmYN02 is the virus most closely 2 related to SARS-CoV-2. The relative high synonymous divergence also shows that the apparent 3 high nucleotide similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat strains (96.2% (Zhou, Yang, et al. 4 2020) and 97.2% (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020)) is caused by conservation at the amino acid level 5 (d N / d S = 0.0410 and 0.0555) exacerbated by a high degree of synonymous homoplasy 6 facilitated by a highly unusual nucleotide composition. 7
The synonymous divergence to the pangolin sequences GD410721 and GX_P1E in 8 genomic regions with inferred recombination tracts removed is 0.5095 (95% C.I., 0.4794-9 0.5396) and 1.0304 (95% C.I., 0.9669-1.0939), respectively. Values for other comparisons are 10 shown in Tables 2 and 3. In comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and more distantly related 11 strains, d S will be larger than 1, and with this level of saturation, estimation of divergence is 12 associated with high variance and may be highly dependent on the accuracy of the model 13 assumptions. This makes phylogenetic analyses based on synonymous mutations unreliable 14 when applied to these more divergent sequences. Nonetheless, the synonymous divergence 15 levels seem generally quite compatible with a molecular clock with a d S of 0.9974 (95% C.I., 16 0.9381-1.0567), 1.0366 (95% C.I., 0.9737-1.0995), 1.0333 (95% C.I., 0.9699-1.0967) and 17 1.0304 (95% C.I., 0.9669-1.0939) between the outgroup, GX_P1E , and the three ingroup 18 strains. The largest value is observed for RaTG13 (1.0366), despite this sequence being the 19 most early sampled sequence, perhaps caused by additional undetected recombination into 20
RaTG13. Another possibility is that RaTG13 has been maintained under conditions which have 21 allowed it to continue to evolve after its initial sampling.

Notice that we truncate the estimate of d S at 3.0. 1 Differences between estimates larger than 2.0 should not be interpreted strongly, as these 2 estimates have high variance and likely will be quite sensitive to the specifics of the model 3 assumptions. 4
We find that d S (SARS-CoV-2, GD410721) approximately equals d S (GD410721, 5 RaTG13) and is larger than d S (SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) in almost the entire genome showing 6 than in these parts of the genome GD410721 is a proper outgroup to (SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) . 7
One noticeable exception from this is the RBD region of the S gene. In this region the 8 divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 is substantially lower than between 9 GD410721 and RaTG13 (Fig. 4A,C) . The same region also has much smaller divergence 10 between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 than between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 (Fig. 4A,C) . 11
The pattern is quite different than that observed in the rest of the genome, most easily seen by 12 considering the ratio of d S (SARS-CoV-2, GD410721) to d S (SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) (Fig. 2B,D) . 13
In fact, the estimates of d S (SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) are saturated in this region, even though 14 they are substantially lower than 1 in the rest of the genome. This strongly suggests a 15 recombination event in the region and provides independent evidence of that previously 16 reported based on amino acid divergence (e.g., ). Unfortunately, because of the high level of synonymous divergence to the nearest 7 outgroup, tree estimation in small windows is extremely labile in this region. In fact, synonymous 8 divergence appears fully saturated in the comparison with GX_P1E, eliminating the possibility to 9 infer meaningful trees based on synonymous divergence. However, we can use the overall 10 maximum likelihood tree using both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 2D) . The 11 ML tree using sequence from the ACE2 contact residue region supports the clustering of SARS-12
CoV-2 and GD410721, but with unusual long external branches for all strains except SARS-13
CoV-2, possibly reflecting smaller recombination regions within the ACE2 contact residue 14 region. 15 16
The use of synonymous mutations provides an opportunity to calibrate the molecular clock 18 without relying on amino acid changing mutations that are more likely to be affected by 19 selection. The rate of substitution of weakly and slightly deleterious mutations is highly 20 dependent on ecological factors and the effective population size. Weakly deleterious mutations 21 are more likely to be observed over small time scales than over long time scales, as they are 22 unlikely to persist in the population for a long time and go to fixation. This will lead to a 23 decreasing d N /d S ratio for longer evolutionary lineages. Furthermore, changes in effective 24 population size will translate into changes in the rate of substitution of slightly deleterious 25 mutations. Finally, changes in ecology (such as host shifts, host immune changes, changes in 26 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

For all of 1 these reasons, the use of synonymous mutations, which are less likely to be the subject of 2 selection than nonsynonymous mutations, are preferred in molecular clock calculations. For 3 many viruses, the use of synonymous mutations to calibrate divergence times is not possible, 4 as synonymous sites are fully saturated even at short divergence times. However, for the 5 comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02, 6 synonymous sites are not saturated and can be used for calibration. We find an estimate of ω = 7 0.0391 between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, excluding just the small RDB region inferred by 8 3SEQ to be recombined in SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 5 
To calibrate the clock we use the estimate provided by (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-21 analysis-of-sars-cov-2-update-2020-03-06/420) of =1.04×10 -3 substitutions/site/year (95% CI: 22 0.71x10-3, 1.40x10-3).

Taking into account that RaTG13 was isolated July 2013, we find an 2 estimated tMRCA between that strain and SARS-CoV-2 of =(96.92 +6.5)/2 = 51.71 years. Table 5 ), the estimate is 55.02 years with an approx. 95% C.I. of (29.4, 80.7). As more SARS-17
CoV-2 sequences are being obtained, providing more precise estimates of the mutation rate, 18 this confidence interval will become narrower. However, we warn that the estimate is based on 19 a molecular clock assumption and that violations of this assumption eventually will become a 20 more likely source of error than the statistical uncertainty quantified in the calculation of the 21 confidence intervals. We also note that, so far, we have assumed no variation in the mutation 22 rate among synonymous sites. However, just from the analysis of the 300 bp windows, it is clear 23 that is not true. The variance in the estimate of d S among 300 bp windows from the RaTG13-24 SARS-CoV-2 comparison is approximately 0.0113. In contrast, in the simulated data assuming 25 constant mutation rate, the variance is approximately 0.0034, suggesting substantial variation in 26 A consequence of the skewed nucleotide frequencies is a high degree of homoplasy in 13 synonymous sites that challenges estimates of d S . We here evaluated estimators of d S in 300 bp 14 sliding windows and found that a bias-corrected version of the maximum likelihood estimator 15 tended to perform best for values of d S < 2. We used this estimator to investigate the 16 relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in sliding windows. We show that 17 1 closely related to SARS-CoV-2. In any case, the 3SEQ analyses presented provides further 2 support for the recombination hypothesis. However, we also find that the synonymous 3 divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin viruses in this region is relatively high, 4 suggesting that the recombination was into RaTG13 from an unknown strain, rather than 5 between pangolin viruses and SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the hypothesis proposed 6 by Boni, et al. 2020, and we can exclude the possibility of a very recent recombination event 7 between pangolins and SARS-CoV-2. Another alternative explanation is that there is a 8 mutational hotspot located in the RBD region. While it is possible that selection may have 9 favored hypermutability in this domain, the most parsimonious explanation at the moment, in the 10 absence of knowledge of molecular mechanisms to explain such a hotspot, is recombination 11 into the RaTG13 strain. To fully distinguish between these hypotheses, additional strains would 12 have to be discovered that either are candidates for introgression into RaTG13 or can break up 13 the lineage in the phylogenetic tree between pangolin viruses and RaTG13. 14 The fact that synonymous divergence to the outgroups, RaTG13 and RmYN02, is not 15 fully saturated, provides an opportunity for a number of different analyses. First, we can date the 16 time of the divergence between the bat viruses and SARS-CoV-2 using synonymous mutations 17 alone. In doing so, we find estimates of 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years 18 (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively. Most of the uncertainty in these estimates comes from 19 uncertainty in the estimate of the mutation rate reported for SARS-CoV-2. As more data is being 20 produced for SARS-CoV-2, the estimate should become more precise and the confidence 21 interval significantly narrowed. However, we warn that a residual cause of unmodeled statistical 22 uncertainty is deviations from the molecular clock. Variation in the molecular clock could be 23 modeled statistically (see e.g., Drummond, et al. 2006 and Lartillot, et al. 2016 ), but the fact that 24 synonymous mutations are mostly saturated for more divergent viruses that would be needed to 25 train such models, is a challenge to such efforts.

Another advantage of estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates in the 3 outgroup lineage, is that it can provide estimates of the mutational load of the current pandemic. 4
The d N /d S ratio is almost 14 times larger in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains than in the 5 outgroup lineage. While some of this difference could possibly be explained by positive 6 selection acting at a higher rate after zoonotic transfer, it is perhaps more likely that a 7 substantial proportion of segregating nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious, suggesting a 8 very high and increasing mutation load in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. 9
