In this article, a mathematical model for the transmission of COVID-19 disease is formulated 6 and analysed. It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation at R 0 = 1 when recovered 7 individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is 8 proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally 9 asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter 10 values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R 0 to changes in any of the parameter values 11 involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using 12 the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may 13 play the major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended 14 that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 15 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of 16 symptomatic patients to control the disease.

(2.2). 163 164 We begin by determining the biologically feasible set for the model (2.2). The following theorem 165 implies that the solutions of (2.2) are nonnegative and bounded from above, provided that the initial 166 conditions are nonnegative. 170 To determine the equilibrium solutions, we set the right-hand side of (2.2) equal to zero and obtain 171 (1 − h)π − (λ + σe + µ)S + (1 − ω)ϕR = 0, hπ + σeS − ((1 − ρ)λ + µ)Se + ωϕR = 0, ηλS + φ(1 − ρ)λS e − (θ + α + µ)C = 0, (1 − η)λS + (1 − φ)(1 − ρ)λS e + θC − (γ + µ + δ)I = 0, αC + γI − (ϕ + µ)R = 0, C + ξ I − ψE = 0.

The basic reproduction number denoted by R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary 188 cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infected individual during its 189 entire period of being infectious [11, 38] . Mathematically, R 0 is the spectral radius of B in Eq. (3.4) 190 and after further simplification, we obtain
The next result is a direct application of Theorem 2 in [38] . 
The proof of Theorem 3.3 is carried out using the center manifold theory in [6] and is given in [23] . Let X = (X 1 , X 2 ) with X 1 = (S, S e , R) ∈ R 3 and X 2 = (C, I, E) ∈ R 3 . Then the system (2.2) can 212 be written as

We show that the five sufficient conditions of Kamgang-Sallet Theorem (in [23] ) are satisfied as 220 follows. 221 1. The system (2.2) is a dynamical system on Ω. This is proved in Theorem 3.1.
2. The equilibrium X * 1 is GAS for the subsystemẊ 1 = A 1 (X 1 , 0)(X 1 − X * 1 ). This is obvious from 223 the structure of the involved matrix. Indeed,
Hence, by the Kamgang-Sallet Stability Theorem [23] , the disease-free equilibrium is globally 230 asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1.
The reality behind Theorem 3.4 is that, if immunity is permanent (ϕ = 0), coronavirus will be 232 effectively controlled in the community if R 0 can be brought to a value less than unity. .

The total population of Hubei province was estimated as 59. for the year 2019 which gives an average mortality rate of µ = 3.57 × 10 −5 per day. The recruitment 250 rate is thus given as π = µ × N 0 , where N 0 is taken to be the total population size, 59.2 million.
The average time period taken for symptoms to appear after exposure is observed to vary for after the end of the respiratory symptoms and fever is at least 72 hours.
The waning of the immunity after recovery is estimated to range between 4 months to 1 year, 262 which gives an interval for ϕ as (0.00274, 0.00824) day −1 . For our simulation, we consider a nominal 263 value of ϕ = 0.00274 day −1 (approximately one year). We propose that at the end of the epidemic, at 264 least 20 − 65% of the recovering population will learn from the experiences during the infection and 265 even when the acquired immunity wanes, such individuals will become susceptible individuals with 266 past history/knowledge of the disease.

Applying the above described set of assumptions in the bound for some of the parameters, we 286 optimize the model output to fit the daily new cases data reported for the Hubei province, China.
The parameter values that best fit to the incidence data is given in Table 3 . Figure 2 shows the plot of 288 the reported new-case data together with the incidence of the disease obtained from the model. As 289 we can observe from the graph, the model slightly overestimates the reported data except for the two 290 highest points. In addition, since our model does not assume any control measure at this stage while 291 the reported data after the 31st day may represent the effect of the strict lockdown measure taken by 292 the authorities, the parameters estimated seem to give a good result. When we calculate the value of 293 R 0 from Eq. (3.5) using the estimated parameters given in Table 3 , we obtain R 0 ≈ 2.91, which is 296 We examine the sensitivity of R 0 to variations in parameter values and establish the significance of 297 the sensitivity indices. We used the Latin hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an efficient 298 stratified Monte Carlo sampling that allows for simultaneous sampling of the multi-dimensional 299 parameter space [19] .

In this respect, we note that increasing social/physical distancing directly reduces β 1 as this lowers Table 4 that reducing the rate at which 320 the virus is shed into the environment is significant in reducing the severity of the problem.

To identify the most important parameters in 331 containing or aggravating the epidemic, we computed p-values for the simulated parameters using 332 Fisher's Transformation [1] . We note that the computed PRCCs are bounded between the interval 333 [−1, 1]. For this matter, some sampling distribution of variables that are highly correlated is skewed.
The Fisher's Transformation ρ(r) = 0.5 log 1+r 1−r is used to transform the skew distribution to a 335 normal distribution and then compute p-values for each of the parameters based on the PRCCs [1] .
The PRCCs for the parameters together with their corresponding p-values are indicated in Table 4 . 337 We carry out pairwise comparison of the significant parameters (whose p-values are less than 338 0.05, see Table 4 ) to ascertain whether the process described by such parameters are different.

We summarise our results in Table 6 , where "TRUE" indicates that the compared parameters are 345 significantly different and "FALSE" indicating that the parameters are not significantly different. We observe that the more sensitive parameters are also significantly different (see Table 6 ) except 347 for the β 1 − ε pair which may not necessarily be related. 348 We examine effect of variation of the sensitive parameters on the reproduction number (R 0 ).

We also note that hygienic 368 practices without social/physical distancing may not significantly slow down the infection.
In summary, we observe that it is possible to reduce the value of R 0 to a value less than unity 370 by reducing only the value of β 1 below 0.1 (see Figure 5 (a)). This observation is in direct agreement 371 with mitigation approaches that are aimed at minimising human-to-human contact (such as social 372 distancing and imposing a lockdown). Therefore, the paremeter β 1 is more influential in the model Table 3 ), and the individuals who decided to use any one of them are strict in following 385 the appropriate rules. thereby about 1% of the total asymptomatic individuals can be detected.
A similar scenario is being applied currently in some sub-Saharan African countries.
The time profile in Figure 6 shows the situation described in Case 1. From this graph we can 395 observe that the infection stabilizes around its endemic equilibrium, which is nearly at 5000 18 .

In this case, we assume that strict and longer time (6 weeks) of social distancing rules are 399 enforced by the government nearly 4 weeks after the first positive case of COVID-19 is reported 400 in the community. 401 We assume for simulation purpose that the implementation of the intervention strategy is CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Case 3: In this case, we assume that early action with shorter time social distancing rule is applied.
In this scenario, it is assumed that the interventions described in Case 1 started half way 444 through the time Phase 2 was implemented in Case 1. That means, the implementation of the 445 interventions described in the four phases of Case 1 is assumed to be followed, but the length of 446 the time in Phases 1 and 2 is reduced as described below.

Otherwise, any lower proportion of this effort will imply the emergence of a second wave of 465 infection in the community. 466 Figure 9 : Dynamics of the disease with 30% of the C class and at least 70% of the I class are detected and quarantined in Phase 4 (after the interventions described in Case 2 are carried out).
Therefore, to contain COVID-19 in every given community, public health authorities need to 467 work more on the detection and quarantining of the asymptomatic infectious individuals.
Case 4: In this case, we assume that no lockdown but only large number of testing is applied to 469 detect and quarantine large proportion of infected cases.
If it is possible to beef up the effort of tracing the asymptomatic infectious individuals and be 471 able to quarantine at least 35% of them continuously and effectively, our simulation shows that 472 there is a possibility for the disease to be contained without imposing the strict lockdown rule 473 on the total population. The plot in Figure 10 shows the time profile of the count of the infected 474 groups while about 50% of the individuals from I class are effectively quarantined (for example 475 inside appropriate health facilities). 476 We can observe that this intervention strategy can also produce the required result in containing 477 the outbreak as some countries (like South Korea) is currently being following this pattern. This scenario is more applicable in highly resource constrained countries as the current cost of 481 testing is high. In this case, it is assumed that the length of duration for each phase (except for 482 Phase 2) is the same as given in Case 2.

an effect of reducing 70% of human contacts and 50% of environmental variables, The time profile of the infection following the scenario in Case 5 is plotted in Figure 11 .
The simulation out for this scenario shows that even if we increase the length of lockdown period 495 to 11 weeks (like it was practised in the Hubei province, China) the disease may re-emerge after 496 some period of time. However, the heights of the peaks in the subsequent waves of the disease 497 are much more less than that of the first peak. Therefore, once again, unless the authorities 498 apply some kind of strict contact tracing mechanism and conduct enough testing to detect 499 and isolate up to 30% of the asymptomatic infectious individuals, the disease persist in the 500 community with multiple subsequent waves.
In general, from the simulations, we can observe that in all of the above scenarios a transition 502 from one phase to the other intervention phase is characterised by a surge in new cases. However, 503 the number will eventually go down if the intervention in the immediate next phase is effective, and 504 otherwise the disease re-emerges in the population. 505

We presented a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 whose first cases were reported [34] . From our sensitivity 519 analysis simulations, we observed that for some given parameter combinations the values of R 0 can 520 be reduced to below 1, and similarly to values much higher than 4.
We observed that if the recovering individuals do so with permanent immunity (ϕ = 0), then 522 reducing the reproduction number to a value below unity is enough to contain the infection. On the 523 other hand, if recovering individuals do so with temporary immunity (ϕ = 0), the proposed model 524 exhibits backward bifurcation, which implies that reducing the value of R 0 below 1 is not enough to 525 contain the infection. 526 24 .

We further observed that increased decay of the pathogen from the environment 532 (achieved by disinfecting surfaces) is less significant in reducing/curbing the number of cases. 533 We further observed that having high numbers of people with knowledge from previous similar When providing the mitigation strategies, we did not account for the delay between the actual 551 incidence and the point when cases are confirmed since the actual parameters describing such a delay 552 are not known. In health systems where testing of suspected cases is done after individuals show 553 symptoms or on demand, it is likely to have a big gap between the actual incidence and confirmation 554 of new cases. The impact of the delay between actual incidence and confirmation of case can be 555 explored in future work. In addition, we assumed that all individuals who recover, do so with the 556 same level of immunity. However, this may not necessarily be the case since immunity of individuals 557 is affected by a number of factors including age, cortisol levels and nutrition among others. The 558 impact of differentiated levels of immunity on the disease dynamics and potential resurgence of 559 the epidemic can be explored in the future when relevant data becomes available. Our model did 560 not include the possibility of vaccination or treatment. We however acknowledge their importance 561 in controlling the infection. Therefore, optimal control of infection in presence of these mitigation 562 strategies can be explored in the as some of the relevant data become available.
