Inflammation resulting from tissue injury blocks antigen-specific cutaneous immunity during 24 ageing. Monocytes recruited to the skin inhibit TRM function through COX2-derived 25 prostaglandin E2 production. Blocking inflammation and resulting prostaglandin E2 26 production with a p38-MAP kinase inhibitor significantly enhances cutaneous antigen-27 specific responses. 28 author/funder.

Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) was used for defining network clusters using an 208 inflation value of 2.2. For experiments involving co-culture of monocytes with skin TRM cells, two suction blisters 226 were formed over uninjected skin, as described previously (Akbar et al., 2013) . Cells were 227 collected from the blister the following day and incubated on plastic for 3 hours, to remove 228 mononuclear phagocytes. Cell suspensions (predominantly CD4 + T cells) were removed and 229 labelled with CellTrace Violet and co-cultured with unstimulated or LPS stimulated 230 monocytes as described above. Cell pellets from 3 hour monocyte co-cultures were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer 240 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signalling) for 241 author/funder.

characteristics can be found in Table 1 . Although there were more females in our older adult 280 group, there was no difference in response between male and female older adults 281 (Supplementary Figure 1A) . Volunteers were injected intradermally with VZV skin test 282 antigen in one arm (for the clinical score) and with saline (0.9% NaCl) in the other arm as a 283 control. 5mm biopsies were collected from the injection sites 6 hours post-injection and 284 compared to biopsies of normal (unmanipulated) skin ( Figure 1A ). We showed previously 285 that mononuclear phagocyte numbers were increased at the site of saline injection in old but 286 not young subjects and that this accumulation was negatively correlated with the magnitude 287 of antigen-specific responses induced in the contralateral arm of the same individual 288 in CD14 + and CCR2 + CD14 + cells in old saline-injected skin ( Figure 1D ). 307
To investigate whether this inflammatory response after saline injection in older humans was 308 due to sodium chloride itself or a response to needle injury, we performed intradermal 309 injections with the same volume of air instead of saline (20μl). Air injection also induced a 310 significant increase in the number of monocytes at the site of air challenge in old but not 311 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The 312 accumulation of monocytes was also observed at six hours at the site of VZV injection in old 313 but not young adults ( Figure 1E ). Taken together these data suggest that old subjects have 314 a heightened inflammatory response to mild skin injury that is not observed in young 315
We previously showed that >85% of older individuals have a low VZV response, clinical 317 score between 0-3, while >85% of young individuals have a score of between 3-10 (Agius et 318 al., 2009; Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015). However, a small proportion of older people 319 (~15%) show good cutaneous VZV responsiveness (score 3-10), a group we designated as 320 'old responders'. To assess whether the CD14 + monocyte infiltration was a characteristic of 321 all aged individuals or only those with reduced VZV-specific immunity, we investigated the 322 infiltration of these cells after saline in old VZV responders (red circles) and low responders 323 (filled circles). Old responders to VZV exhibited a similar low extent of CD14 + monocyte 324 infiltration to younger adults (black squares). However, the majority of older donors with a 325 low clinical score (filled circles) had elevated infiltration of these cells. When all the data was 326 combined there was a significant negative correlation between the fold change in CD14 + 327 monocytes in response to saline challenge and the VZV clinical score (R=-0.38 and p=0.04; 328 Figure 1E ). Collectively this indicates that the early recruitment of monocytes to the site of 329 skin challenge in old people was associated with decreased antigen-specific immunity. 330 331 Senescent stromal cells contribute to recruitment of monocytes in the old. 332
We hypothesised that the increase in CD14 + cells in the skin was due to recruitment of 333 circulating monocytes, since CCR2 + expression supported the possibility of recruitment in 334 response to CCL2. The alternative explanation that proliferation of local tissue-resident 335 macrophages (identified as CD163 + ) was not observed (data not shown). This is in line with 336 murine studies showing dermal macrophages are constantly replenished from the monocyte 337 pool (Tamoutounour et al., 2013) . We first investigated the activation status of the dermal 338 endothelium to determine whether it was permissive for monocyte recruitment. CD62E, also 339 known as E-selectin, was used as a marker of activated endothelium as it binds to sialylated 340 carbohydrates expressed on leukocytes and facilitates their extravasation into the tissue. 341
Saline-injected skin of old but not young adults exhibited increased CD62E expression on 342 the CD31 + endothelium when compared to normal skin (Figure 2A and B). Furthermore, 343 transcriptional analysis of skin biopsies indicated that there was increased expression of a 344 range of genes encoding monocyte chemoattractants including CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL2 and 345 CXCL1 in old but not young saline-injected skin as compared to normal skin ( Figure 2C ). 346 author/funder.

The increase of CCL2 expression (one of the main monocyte chemoattractants) was as a marker of fibroblasts, we found that there was a significant increase in the number of 351 fibroblasts expressing CCL2 in the skin of old subjects after saline injection as compared to 352 normal un-injected skin from old donors ( Figure 2E The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.020081 doi: bioRxiv preprint and C). When staining for COX2 was performed in combination with CD14 there was a 382 significant increase in CD14 + COX2 + cells in saline injected as compared to normal skin 383
To demonstrate that COX2 expressing monocytes can inhibit the activation of CD4 + T cells, 385
we first induced COX2 expression in these cells that were isolated from peripheral blood by volunteers. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on normal skin to determine 408 expression of EP4 on CD4 + TRM (as identified by co-expressing CD69; Figure 4A ). The 409 majority of CD4 + TRM expressed EP4 (81.2%), indicating that they have the capacity to 410 respond to PGE2 produced by monocytes. We next assessed the co-localisation of CD14 + 411 monocytes and CD4 + TRM cells in normal and saline injected skin from old subjects. In normal 412 skin, CD14 + monocytes were on average 15.86μm away from CD4 + TRM, however after 413 saline injection the monocytes were significantly closer to the CD4 + TRM (9.47μm; Figure 4B  414 and C). This increased proximity was likely due to increase in the number of monocytes in 415 the skin after saline injection. To confirm that monocytes have the ability to suppress skin 416 CD4 + TRM proliferation, CD4 + TRM were isolated from the skin using suction blister technology 417 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.020081 doi: bioRxiv preprint as described previously ( Figure 4D ) (Akbar et al., 2013) . Skin CD4 + TRM cells were pre-418 labelled with CellTrace Violet and stimulated with CD3 and IL-2 in the presence of either 419 stimulated or unstimulated monocytes for four days. We observed a significant reduction in 420 CD4 + TRM cell proliferation in the presence of stimulated when compared to unstimulated 421 monocytes ( Figure 4E and F) supporting the hypothesis that COX2 + monocytes have the 422 capability to suppress TRM proliferation. 423 424 p38 MAP kinase inhibition significantly reduces CCL2 production from senescent 425
We showed previously that treatment of old subjects with the anti-inflammatory p38-MAPK 427 inhibitor, Losmapimod, significantly enhanced the response to VZV antigens in the skin 428 Figure 4B) . Furthermore, after Losmapimod there was a 445 significant reduction in the number of CCL2 + cells and the number of CCL2 + senescent 446 fibroblasts as defined as being p16 + FSP-1 + (Figures 5D, 5E) . We confirmed experimentally 447 that the treatment of senescent dermal fibroblasts with Losmapimod in vitro significantly 448 reduced their CCL2 production, suggesting Losmapimod could have a direct effect on 449 senescent fibroblast in vivo (Supplementary Figure 4C) . As a result of the reduced CCL2 450 there was significantly reduced monocyte infiltration in saline injected skin Post-Losmapimod 451 ( Figure 5F ). In addition, when VZV injected skin (6 hour post-injection) was assessed there 452 was a significant reduction in the number of monocytes after Losmapimod treatment. 453 author/funder.

in vivo. To test this, we performed Western blot analysis of LPS activated monocytes in the 461 presence or absence of Losmapimod. Losmapimod significantly decreased the LPS induced 462 expression of phopho-p38 MAPK and COX2 in vitro (Figures 6A and B ). In addition, PGE2 463 production was also significantly decreased after Losmapimod treatment ( Figure 6C ). 464
Furthermore, the addition of Losmapimod to co-cultures of CD4 + T cells that were activated 465 in the presence of LPS treated monocytes ( Figure 6D ) enhanced their proliferation to a 466 similar extent to that observed after direct COX2 or EP4 inhibition ( Figure 3G The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.020081 doi: bioRxiv preprint MAP kinase inhibitor Losmapimod can significantly enhance the cutaneous immune 490 response to antigen challenge in older adults. 491 author/funder.

Since the majority of the patients with most severe symptoms are older (Stephanie Bialek, 2020), it will be important to determine the 564 mechanism by which these "inflammatory" monocytes are recruited into the lung. It is 565 possible that once inflammatory monocytes are recruited into the lungs of these patients 566 they may inhibit the function of virus-specific T cells, by the mechanism that we have 567 described, thus preventing appropriate anti-viral immunity (Stephanie Bialek, 2020) .

In older adults the mild damage induced by injection (of air, saline or VZV) results in production of CCL2 from senescent fibroblasts and recruitment of monocytes into the skin 6 hours post injection. The recruited monocytes inhibit TRM proliferation via upregulation of COX2 and subsequent production of the lipid mediator Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The treatment of older adults with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, Losmapimod, results in reduced CCL2 production from the senescent fibroblasts and reduced monocyte infiltration. In addition, p38 MAPK is upstream of COX2 signalling, therefore the treatment with Losmapimod also inhibits COX2 upregulation and reduced PGE2 production. This significantly increases the T cell response to VZV in the skin of older subjects author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
