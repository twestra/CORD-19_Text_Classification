Background: Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus 23 disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public 24 health community's preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics 25 and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid 26 generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some 27 instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and 28 therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate 29 mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned 30 or newly designed assays.
Results: Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature 32 regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the 33 PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro 34 with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-35 2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR 36 assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in 37 silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe 38 sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive 39 hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays 40 are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene.

Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 42 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. : bioRxiv preprint 3 Conclusions: Here we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its 44 capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to 45 detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico 46 detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is 47 designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics 48 experience. 49 Background 50 Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have serious adverse impacts on society 51 with respect to lives lost and annual economic losses [1-5], as being witnessed currently in the 52 COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of March 9, 2020, there 53 have been 113,584 confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the globe and 3,996 deaths [6-8]. 54 Factors such as climate change, urbanization, zoonotic spillover, international travel, lack or 55 breakdown of public health care systems, natural or man-made disasters, and pathogen evolution 56 to name a few, contribute to infectious disease emergence and sustainment [2]. 57 A unique challenge associated with emerging infectious diseases is rapidly identifying 58 the etiological agent and developing or repurposing existing medical countermeasures (MCMs), 59 including diagnostic assays, to curtail the spread of an outbreak. With respect to reemerging 60 infectious diseases the challenge is to determine whether existing MCMs are effective or not, and 61 in the latter case, develop or modify the MCMs in a timely manner. In some cases, the failure of 62 existing MCMs can be accounted for by genetic drift and shift and the resulting altered genotypic 63 and phenotypic profiles of the newly emergent pathogen. Ebolavirus is one such reemerging 64 infectious disease agent that exhibits high degrees of genetic changes in every new outbreak.
Using next generation sequencing, the whole genome sequence (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 134 are continuously being released and shared (306 complete genomes as of March 09, 2020) with 135 the entire research community through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) 136 [31]. The release of WGS allowed us to test the BioLaboro pipeline (described in this study) to 137 evaluate currently used diagnostic assays and to rapidly design new assays. 138 In a previous study, we described a bioinformatics tool called PSET (PCR signature 139 erosion tool) and used it to show in silico, confirmed with wet lab work, the effectiveness of 140 existing Ebolavirus diagnostic assays against a large number of sequences available at that time 141 [32]. The phrase "signature erosion" used here signifies potential false-positive or false-negative 142 results in PCR assays due to mutations in the primers, probe, or amplicon target sequences (PCR 143 signatures). Signature erosion could also mean failure of medical countermeasures; for example, 144 a change in the genomic sequence resulting in an amino acid change that could potentially alter 145 the efficacy of sequence-based therapeutics [33, 34] . 146 In this study, we describe an expanded bioinformatics pipeline called BioLaboro in which 147 we have integrated several tools: BioVelocity®, Primer3 and PSET for end-to-end analysis of 148 outbreak pathogen genome sequences to evaluate existing PCR assay efficacy against the new 149 sequences, and to identify unique signature regions (BioVelocity), design PCR assays to these 
BioLaboro architecture 158 BioLaboro is comprised of three algorithms -BioVelocity, Primer3, and PSET -which 159 are built into a pipeline for user-friendly applications. The user has the option to launch one of 160 four different job types: Signature Discovery, Score Assay Targets, Validate Assay, or New 161 Assay Discovery. Each of the three algorithms can be run individually or together as a complete 162 end-to-end pipeline (Figure 1 ). For the BOMV use case, in the first phase of the pipeline 163 BioVelocity was used to analyze a set of genome sequences for unique regions that are both 164 conserved and signature to the target sequences selected. This was achieved by splitting a chosen 165 representative whole genome sequence into sliding 50 base pairs (bps) k-mers. Each k-mer was 166 then scanned against all target sequences to determine conservation. Conserved k-mers were then 167 elongated based on overlaps and formed into contigs. These contigs were then split into k-mers ≤ 168 250 bps and scanned against all non-target sequences to determine specificity. All passing 169 sequences were then elongated based on overlaps and the signature contigs were passed to the 170 next step in the pipeline. Primer3 was then used to evaluate the signature contigs to identify 171 suitable primers and probes for assay development. Primer3 was run in parallel against all 172 signatures and the output was ranked by penalty score in ascending order. The top five best 173 primer sets were passed along to the final step in the pipeline, PSET. In this step the primer sets 174 were run through a bioinformatics pipeline which aligned the sequences against large public 175 sequence databases from NCBI using BLAST and GLSEARCH [36] to determine how well each 176 assay correctly aligned to all target sequences while excluding off-target hits. 199 Even the two assays that passed in silico criteria did not have perfect matches raising the 200 possibility that these assays may fail in wet lab testing due to mismatches against currently 201 available BOMV genomic sequences. Hence, as described below, we designed new assays using 202 the BioLaboro platform.
Discovery of potential new BOMV assays using BioLaboro end-to-end pipeline 204 Using BioLaboro we ran a New Assay Discovery job to discover new BOMV signatures 205 and determine their potential for accurate detection using PSET. In the first phase, BioVelocity 206 was used to search for conserved and signature regions within the selected genomes. We selected 207 the organism of interest by searching for "Bombali ebolavirus" from the database and selecting 208 the three available complete genomes. The MF319185.1 genome was used as the algorithmic 209 reference sequence as it is the same one that NCBI selected for the RefSeq database (Genbank 210 ID: NC_039345.1). The algorithmic reference sequence was first split into k-mers of 50 bps each 211 using a sliding window of 1 bp, which amounts to 18,994 k-mers to be evaluated with 212 BioVelocity's conserved sequence detection algorithm. BioVelocity found 27% (5,237) of these 213 k-mers to be conserved in all three of the BOMV genomes. The conserved k-mers were then 214 evaluated to determine overlapping segments and were combined into 120 conserved contigs.
These contigs were next evaluated with BioVelocity's signature sequence detection algorithm.
The contigs were split into signatures with a max size of 250 bps (longer contigs were split into 217 250 k-mers with a step size of 1). The conserved k-mer sequences were evaluated against 218 .

There were 291 k-219 mers sequences found to be signatures to BOMV. The signatures were then evaluated to 220 determine overlapping reads and combined back into 119 signature contigs. Metrics for the 221 BioVelocity run in phase one are shown in Table 2 Table 3 Legend. The five new assays identified by Primer3 ranked by lowest penalty score. The

The signature regions identified by BioVelocity and the five new assays selected by 241 Primer3 were mapped to the BOMV genome ( Figure 2 ). As shown, the four assays are clustered The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963 doi: bioRxiv preprint 
In the third phase, PSET was used to test the five newly designed assays identified by 250 Primer3 in silico against publicly available sequences. PSET was used to analyze the primers and 251 probes in the new assays using bioinformatics tools to identify potential false-positive and false-252 negative matches to NCBIs BLAST nucleotide sequence repositories (nt, gss, and env_nt) 253 comprised of over 220 million sequences (as of last update in September 2019). BLAST+ was 254 used to compare the assay amplicon sequences against these sequence repositories to identify 255 matches. These matches were then used to create a custom library of sequences for GLSEARCH, 256 a global-local sequence comparison tool in the FASTA suite of programs, which was used to 257 search for the individual primers and probes. The resulting output was then processed and 258 filtered based on pre-defined hit acceptance criteria. These criteria require that the assay 259 components all hit to 90% identity over 90% of the component length, primer pairs were on 260 opposite strands, and the total amplicon size was no greater than 1000 bps. The results were then 261 validated by comparing the hits to the target NCBI Taxonomy identifier (ID), and true and false 262 matches were reported. PSET results confirmed that the top five primer sets had true positive hits 263 to all three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other organism (Table 4) .

BioVelocity was used to search for conserved and signature regions within the selected genomes.
Ninety six complete SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences were downloaded from the GISAID 282 and uploaded to BioLaboro as a custom database. These 96 genomes were used as our reference 283 set and EPI_ISL_404253 (Genbank ID: MN988713.1) was used as the algorithmic reference 284 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The algorithmic reference sequence was first split into k-mers of 50 bps each using a 285 sliding window of 1 bp, which amounted to 29,833 k-mers to be evaluated with the conserved 286 sequence detection algorithm. BioVelocity found 79% (23,542) of these k-mers to be conserved 287 in all 96 of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The conserved k-mers were then evaluated to determine 288 overlapping segments and were combined into 96 conserved contigs. These contigs were next 289 evaluated with BioVelocity's signature sequence detection algorithm. The contigs were split into Table 5 . In the second phase, Primer3 was used to identify potential primer pairs and probes for 302 generating new PCR detection assays as described above for BOMV. There were 330 primer 303 sets created from the signatures which were assigned a penalty score to facilitate comparison of 304 the results.

The five new assays were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome presented below (Figure 3 ). This 316 figure shows that four assays are in the ORF1ab and one is located in the spike (S) gene. By 317 comparison, the CDC and Corman group assays are clustered primarily at the 3' end of the 318 genome in the envelope (E) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) genes. 
In the third phase, PSET was used to test the five newly designed assays identified by 326 Primer3 in silico against publicly available sequences as described above for BOMV signatures.
The results were then validated by comparing the hits to the target NCBI Taxonomy identifier Table 2 ]. Results are shown alongside assays from CDC and 333 Corman et al. [39, 40] (Table 7) .

We also tested the SARS-CoV-2 assays using PSET on near neighbor sequences that 351 were generated during this outbreak, such as the bat and pangolin sequences. As expected the 352 analyses showed a range of TP from pan assays, FN results due to sequence divergence (Table   353   8 ). Table 8 .

Given these gaps and the human and economic impacts of ebolavirus 366 disease, there is an ongoing need for ebolavirus biosurveillance and further characterization of 367 BOMV. Availability of efficient viral RNA detection assays is critical for bio surveillance of 368 these reservoirs.
Based on in silico analyses, we determined that current EBOV assays could potentially 370 fail to detect BOMV sequences, and thus there is a need for BOMV specific assays. Using 371 BioLaboro we rapidly designed and evaluated new, more specific assays. An advantage of 372 BioVelocity is that the end user obtains results quickly with high confidence that the output of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963 doi: bioRxiv preprint mutations altered protein sequences, it became apparent that the changes should be monitored for 389 impacts on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response. In an earlier study 390 conducted to decipher the impact of the then-available diagnostics, we determined that many of 391 the real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays that were in use during that outbreak 
Using the in silico methods described here, only two of the 30 EBOV rRT-PCR assays evaluated 396 against BOMV target sequences met our criteria for successful detection and neither showed 397 perfect matches. For ongoing biosurveillance, we recommend wet lab testing and validation of 398 the rRT-PCR assays described here to ensure detection of BOMV. 399 We also tested the BioLaboro pipeline with available SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963 doi: bioRxiv preprint contains less than 10 SNPs with the exception of one having 25. None of the variations impact 412 the diagnostic assay signatures. However, real-time monitoring of these assays against WGS as 413 they become available, will enable rapid identification of signature erosion if it occurs and 414 generation of new assays as needed. The newly designed assays we have described here need to 415 be validated in wet lab testing and with appropriate clinical matrices to determine their 416 performance. However, we have demonstrated that the BioLaboro pipeline can be used 417 effectively and rapidly to validate available assays and to design new assays using genome 418 sequences of newly emerging pathogens.
By periodically re-running BioLaboro on emerging and reemerging pathogen sequences 421 as they become available, over time the relative diversity can be monitored, and assays can be 422 updated to remain current with regards to available data. By tracking assay performance 423 measures over time, one can evaluate the efficacy of MCMs on a routine basis. These analyses 424 would ensure that the most accurate MCMs are available when an outbreak response is 425 necessary. In this study we demonstrate the value of real-time genomic sequencing and MCM 426 evaluation to provide actionable information before and during a public health emergency.
Combined with an active biosurveillance of zoonotic reservoirs and generation of sequence data 428 to understand the genetic diversity of these pathogens, BioLaboro is broadly applicable for The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963 doi: bioRxiv preprint

PSET is configured to test PCR assays in silico against the latest versions of public test currently deployed assays as well as new assays designed using BioLaboro's capabilities.
The BioLaboro application is composed of a fully functional GUI front-end that allows 467 users to submit jobs to the back-end bioinformatics pipeline hosted on a dedicated large RAM 468 system. The system has multi-user capability with discrete logins and a single job queue. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 The BioLaboro application allows job submissions through a simplified user interface 475 designed for scientists with minimal or no command-line experience. The user can search for 476 sequences of interest using the built-in Organism Select tool, Figure 5 , which allows for 477 searching on free text, NCBI Accession number, or NCBI Taxonomy ID. The results can then be 478 filtered using a "smart filter" which will only include sequences within +/-10% of the calculated 479 median genome length of the results. This tool is useful for automatically excluding plasmids or 480 sequence fragments which can negatively impact signature identification. Alternatively, custom 481 sequence size filters can also be used if the user wants to target specific plasmids or 482 chromosomes.
