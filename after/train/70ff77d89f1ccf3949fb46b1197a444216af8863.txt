A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 , started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic.
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.4% as of April 15, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II, XII, and MG-132 were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies and thermal shift binding assays. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2
therapeutics.
An emerging respiratory disease COVID-19 started to circulate among human in December 2019. Since its first outbreak in China from an unknown origin, it quickly became a global pandemic. As of April 15, 2020, there are 123,010 deaths among 1,914,916 confirmed cases in 213 countries. 1 The etiological pathogen of COVID-19 is a new coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019).
As the name indicates, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS, the virus that causes severe respiratory symptoms in human and killed 774 people among 8098 infected worldwide in 2003. 2 SARS-CoV-2 shares ~82% of sequence identity as SARS and to a less extent for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (~50%). 3,4 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus that belongs to the β-lineage of the coronavirus. 5 The β-lineage also contains two other important human pathogens, the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is around 6.4% as of April 15, 2020, which is lower than that of SARS (~10%) and MERS (~34%). 2 However, current data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious and has a larger R0 value than SARS and MERS, 6 resulting in higher overall death tolls than SARS and MERS. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently spreading at an alarming speed in Europe and the United States.
There is currently no antiviral or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome encodes a number of structural proteins (e.g. capsid spike glycoprotein), non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL or main protease), papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and accessary proteins. Compounds that target anyone of these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates. In this study, we focus on the viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (M pro ), and aim to develop potent M pro inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The M pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication : bioRxiv preprint by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery. 7-9 The M pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M pro . As such, we developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 M pro and their mechanism of action.
The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 with a confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating COVID-19. The compounds identified herein represent the most potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity. 7,9
Results
The M pro gene from SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was inserted into pET-29a(+) vector and expressed in BL21(DE3) E. Coli. with a His-tag in its C-terminus. The M pro protein was purified with Ni-NTA column to high purity (Fig. 1A) . To establish the FRET assay condition, we designed a FRET based substrate using the sequence between viral polypeptide NSP4-NSP5 junction from SARS-CoV-2: Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans). We then tested the M pro proteolytic activity in buffers with different pH. We found that M pro displays highest activity in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 1B) , which contains 20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA,
and 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. As such, all the following proteolytic assay was conducted using this pH 6.5 buffer. Next, we characterized the enzymatic activity of this SARS-CoV-2 M pro by measuring the Km and Vmax values. When 100 nM M pro was mixed with various concentration of FRET substrate (0 to 200 µM), the initial velocity was measured and plotted against substrate concentration. Curve fitting with Michaelis-Menton equation gave the best-fit values of Km and Vmax as 32.8 ± 3.5 µM and 29.4 ± 1.1 RFU/s, respectively (Fig. 1C) . The protease inhibitors are grouped based on their targets and mechanism of action and include proteasome inhibitors (1-8); HIV protease inhibitors (9-14); γ-secretase inhibitors (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) ; HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) ; DPP-4 inhibitors (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) ; miscellaneous serine protease inhibitors (36) (37) (38) (39) ; cathepsin and calpain protease inhibitors (40-43); miscellaneous cysteine protease inhibitors (44-48); matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (49-51); and miscellaneous protease inhibitors (52-55). The inhibitors were pre-incubated with 100 nM of M pro at 30 °C for 30 minutes in the presence of 4 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) before the addition of 10 µM FRET substrate.
The addition of DTT was to quench non-specific thiol reactive compounds and also to ensure the M pro is in the reducing condition. All compounds were tested at 20 µM, except compound 26, which was tested at 2 µM due to its fluorescent background. Encouragingly, four inhibitors (24, 28, 29 and 43) showed more than 60% inhibition against M pro at 20 µM. Among the hits, simeprevir (24), boceprevir (28) , and narlaprevir (29) are HCV NS3-4A serine protease inhibitors, and compound MG-132 (43) inhibits both proteasome and calpain. Table 1 .

The results are average ± standard deviation of two repeats.
Given the encouraging results from the primary screening, we then further characterized the four hits (24, 28, 29, and 43) in a consortium of assays including dose-response titration, thermal shift binding assay (TSA), and counter screening assays with two other viral cysteine proteases, the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 2A and 3C proteases, both of which are cysteine proteases. The HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors boceprevir (28) and narlaprevir (29) inhibited M pro with IC50 values of 4.13 and 4.73 µM, respectively (Table 2) , more potent than simeprevir (24) (IC50 = 13.74 µM).
Both compounds 28 and 29 also showed strong binding towards M pro and shifted the melting temperature of the protein (ΔTm) by 6.67 and 5.18 o C, respectively, at 40 µM. Despite their potent inhibition against the HCV NS3-4A serine protease and the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine M pro , boceprevir (28) and narlaprevir (29) did not inhibit the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC50 > 20 µM), suggesting they are not non-specific cysteine protease inhibitors. The calpain inhibitor MG-132 (43) had an IC50 value of 3.90 µM against the M pro , and was not active against the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC50 > 20 µM). The binding of MG-132 (43) to M pro was also confirmed in the TSA assay with a ΔTm of 4.02 o C.
In light of the promising results of the calpain inhibitor MG-132 (43), we then pursued to testing other calpain and cathepsin inhibitors that are commercially available (56-63) ( Table 2 ). These compounds were not included in the initial library because they have not been advanced to clinical studies. Among this series of analogs, calpain inhibitor II (61) and XII (62) are the most potent We also included two well-known viral 3CL protease inhibitors GC-376 (64) and rupintrivir (65) in the secondary screening. GC-376 (64) is an investigational veterinary drug that is being developed for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 10,11 GC-376 (64) was designed to target the viral 3CL protease and had potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS, FIPV, and norovirus. 10, 12 Rupintrivir (65) was developed as a rhinovirus antiviral by targeting the viral 3CL protease, but it was discontinued in clinical trials due to side effects. 13 In our study, we found that GC-376 (64) was the most potent M pro inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.03 µM. It shifted the melting curve of M pro by 18.30 o C upon binding. In contrast, rupintrivir (65) was not active against M pro (IC50 > 20 µM). Previous report also showed that rupintrivir was not active against the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (M pro ) (IC50 > 100 µM). 14 Both compounds 64 and 65 were not active against the EV-A71 2A protease, but showed potent inhibition against the EV-A71 3C protease, which is consistent with previously reported results. 12, 15, 16 When plotting the IC50 values (log scale) of the inhibitors against M pro from the FRET enzymatic assay with the melting temperature shifts (ΔTm) from thermal shift binding assay (Fig. 3A) , a linear correlation was observed, and the r 2 of the linear regression fitting is 0.94. This suggests that there is a direct correlation between the enzymatic inhibition and protein binding: a more potent enzyme inhibitor also binds to the protein with higher affinity. The stabilization of the M pro against thermal denaturation was also compound concentration dependent (Fig. 3B ). Correlation of inhibition efficacy (IC50) with ΔTm from thermal shift binding assay. Data in Table 2 were used for the plot. The r 2 of fitting is 0.94. (B) Dose-dependent melting temperature (Tm) shift.
To elucidate the mechanism of action of hits against SARS-CoV-2 M pro , we focus on five most potent compounds prioritized from the primary and secondary screenings including boceprevir The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051581 doi: bioRxiv preprint proceeded beyond 90 minutes, we therefore chose the first 90 minutes of the progression curves for curve fitting (Fig. 4 middle column) . We fit the progression curves in the presence different concentrations of GC-376 (64) with the two-step Morrison equation (equation 3 in methods section). GC-376 (64) binds to SARS-CoV-2 M pro with an equilibrium dissociation constant for the inhibitor (KI) of 59.9 ± 21.7 nM in the first step. After initial binding, a slower covalent bond is formed between GC-376 (64) and M pro with the second reaction rate constant (k2) being 0.00245 ± 0.00047 s -1 , resulting an overall k2/KI value of 4.08 x 10 4 M -1 s -1 (Fig. 4A) . However, when we tried to fit the proteolytic progression curves for boceprevir (28) , MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) using the same two-step reaction mechanism, we could not obtain accurate values for the second rate constant k2. This is presumably due to significant substrate depletion before the equilibrium between EI and EI*, leading to very small values of k2. Accordingly, for these four inhibitors 
To test the hypothesis that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of M pro will lead to the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, we performed cellular antiviral assays for the five promising hits 64, 28, 43, 61, and 62 against SARS-CoV-2. For this, we first tested the cellular cytotoxicity of these compounds in multiple cell lines (Table 3) . GC-376 (64), boceprevir (28) , and calpain inhibitor II (61) were well tolerated and had CC50 values of over 100 µM for all the cell lines tested.
MG-132 (43) was cytotoxic to all the cells with CC50 values less than 1 µM except A549 cells.
Calpain inhibitor XII (62) had acceptable cellular cytotoxicity with CC50 values above 50 µM for all the cell lines tested. 
Coronaviruses have caused three epidemics/pandemics in the past twenty years including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists and researchers around the globe are racing to find effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. 24 The viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir holds the greatest promise and it is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. 25, 26 The HIV drug combination lopinavir and ritonavir recently failed in a clinical trial for COVID-19 with no significant therapeutic efficacy was observed. 27 To address this unmet medical need, we initiated a drug repurposing screening to identify potent inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M pro from a collection of FDA-approved protease inhibitors. The M pro has been shown to be a validated antiviral drug target for SARS and MERS. 28 As the SARS-CoV-2 M pro shares a high sequence similarity with SARS and to a less extent with MERS, we reasoned that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro will similarly prevent viral replication. 7, 9 Noticeable findings from our study include: 1) Boceprevir (28) All potent SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors contain reactive warheads such as α-ketoamide (boceprevir (28) , calpain inhibitor XII (62)) or aldehyde (MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitor II (61)) or aldehyde prodrug, the bisulfite (GC-376 (64)). This result suggests that reactive warheads might be essential for SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibition. The compounds identified in this study represent the most potent and selective hits reported so far, and are superior than recently reported SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors ebselen, N3, and 13b (Table 5 ). Aside from the above positive results, we also showed that ritonavir (9) and lopinavir (10) In summary, this study identified several potent SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors with potent enzymatic inhibition as well as potent cellular antiviral activity. Further development based on these hits might lead to clinically useful COVID-19 antivirals. They can be used either alone or in combination with polymerase inhibitors such as remdesivir as a means to achieve potential synergic antiviral effect as well as to suppress drug resistance.

The SARS-CoV-2 M pro FRET substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans) was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis through iterative cycles of coupling and deprotection using the previously optimized procedure. 34 Specifically, chemmatrix rink-amide resin was used. Typical coupling condition was 5 equiv of amino acid, 5 equiv of HATU, and 10 equiv of DIEA in DMF for 5 minutes at 80 o C. For deprotection, 5% piperazine plus 0.1 M HOBt were used and the mixture was heated at 80 o C for 5 minutes. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA, 2.5% Tris, 2.5% H2O and the crude peptide was precipitated from ether after removal of TFA. The final peptide was purified by preparative HPLC.
The purify and identify of the peptide were confirmed by analytical HPLC (> 98% purity) and mass spectrometry. (1)

We observed substrate depletion when proteolytic reactions progress longer than 90 min, therefore only first 90 min of the progress curves were used in the curve fitting ( Figure 6 middle column). In this study, we could not accurately determine the k2 for the protease inhibitors: Calpain inhibitor II, MG132, Boceprevir, and Calpain inhibitor XII, due to the very slow k2 in these case: significant substrate depletion before the establishment of the equilibrium between EI and EI*.
