The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a currently uncontrolled 2 pandemic and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 . It is important to study 3 the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it 4 back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize 5 animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving 6 ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic 7 and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus 8 RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, 9 horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human 10 transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We 11 show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-12 fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-13 Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its 14 residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses.

Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-
CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.
Two subgroups of coronaviruses, including alphacoronaviruses (e.g. swine acute diarrhea syndrome 19 coronavirus, SADS-CoV) and betacoronaviruses (e.g. SARS coronavirus 1, SARS-CoV-1), infect 20 mammals and have broad host ranges spanning bats, rodents, domestic animals, and humans 1-7 . Bats 21 are considered to be the natural reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic human coronaviruses, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342 doi: bioRxiv preprint animals also served as intermediate hosts that facilitated SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its natural 30 reservoir hosts to humans. 31 As of April 7 th 2020, the uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic has already caused over 1,210,000 32 confirmed infections and over 67,000 documented deaths across 211 countries, according to World 33 Health Organization's online updates. There are currently no vaccines or targeted therapeutics 34 available for this disease 11 . It is therefore urgent to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because Receptor binding is a critical determinant for the host range of coronaviruses 6,12 . SARS-CoV-2 utilizes 39 ACE2, the SARS-CoV-1 receptor 13 , as an essential cellular receptor to infect cells 8, 14, 15 . Therefore, in 40 this study, we characterized seventeen ACE2 orthologs for their function to support entry of SARS- 41 CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, a bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV RaTG13) ref. 8 , and a coronavirus 42 recently isolated from Malayan pangolins (called Pangolin-CoV hereafter) 16 . Furthermore, to explore 43 broadly anti-coronavirus approaches to treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated 44 recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants of the viral spike proteins, and soluble ACE2 45 variants for their potency as entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.
A wide range of ACE2 orthologs support binding to RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-48 CoV, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-1 49 The RBD of SARS-CoV-2, like that of SARS-CoV-1, mainly relies on residues in its receptor binding 50 motif (RBM) to bind ACE2 (Figs. 1a and b) [17] [18] [19] . Through analyzing ACE2 residues that are within 5 51 Å from SARS-CoV-2 RBD atoms, we found that these residues are highly conserved across the 52 seventeen analyzed ACE2 orthologs, including human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of sixteen domestic Pangolin-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 BJ01 (Extended Data Fig. 2a) . These RBD proteins were then 57 used to perform surface staining of 293T cells transfected with each of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs 58 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The flow cytometry data clearly show that, although 59 each of the four tested RBDs has a distinctive binding profile, they all can bind to a wide range of 60 ACE2 orthologs. Note that human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of all the domestic animals, except for 61 that of donkeys, guinea pigs, and chickens, support efficient binding to all the four tested RBDs. The 62 lack of any RBD binding to donkey ACE2 is likely due to a protein sequence defect, because 63 expression of the donkey ACE2 is detectable in 293T cells but a 22-residue fragment likely important 64 for ACE2 folding is missing in the Genbank sequence (Fig. 2c , and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2b) . 65 These data suggest that ACE2 orthologs of domestic animals might be generally functional for 66 supporting cell entry of the four tested viruses. CoV-1, were respectively used to infect 293T cells expressing each of the seventeen ACE2 orthologs.
A VSV-G-pseudotyped reporter retrovirus whose entry is independent of ACE2 was used as a control Recombinant RBD and soluble ACE2 proteins have been shown to potently block SARS-CoV-1 89 entry 20,21 . To investigate whether similar approaches could also be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we first 90 produced IgG Fc fusion proteins of RBD (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc) variants (Fig. 4a) . 91 Specifically, the RBD variants include wildtype RBDs of SARS-CoV-1, Pangolin-CoV, and SARS- 
In this study, we found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic animals and pangolins 113 efficiently support binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, a pangolin 114 coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV), and bat coronavirus RaTG13. In addition, the pangolin coronavirus 115 tested here showed the broadest host range. Our data therefore suggest that livestock and companion 116 pets, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits are potential intermediate 117 hosts for these viruses.
