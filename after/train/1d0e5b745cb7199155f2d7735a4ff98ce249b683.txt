One striking feature of the large KRAB-containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family 15 is its rapid expansion and divergence since its formation about 400 million years ago. 16 However, the evolutionary characteristics of KRAB domains, C2H2 zinc fingers and 17 the full protein of KZFPs have not been fully analyzed. As for the drivers of the rapid 18 evolution, it's partly due to their coevolution with transposable elements (TEs). But 19 their diverse functions besides inhibiting TEs suggest other reasons exist. Here we 20 address these two issues by the systematic analysis of the divergence time and 21 diversification pattern of KZFPs at three aspects and the functional analysis of the 22 3
potential target genes besides TEs. We found that old-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.041848 doi: bioRxiv preprint Introduction 42 KRAB domain-containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, the largest family 43 of transcription factors in mammalian (Nowick et al., 2011) , has 363 member genes in 44 human genome. Generally, KZFP contains a KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2 45 zinc finger array with DNA-binding potential (supplementary fig. 1 ). Both C2H2 zinc 46 finger and KRI (KRAB Interior) motif, which is the ancestor of KRAB domain (Birtle 47 & Ponting, 2006) , are old motifs, appearing widely across animals, plants and fungi. 48 However, these two kinds of motifs did not appear in the same protein during the 49 lengthy process of evolution until their 'marriage' in the last common ancestor of 50 coelacanths and tetrapods (Imbeault, Helleboid, & Trono, 2017) about 400 million 51 years ago. After that, the KZFP family expanded and diverged quickly especially 52 during the evolution of mammalian. 53 The phenomena of the rapid evolution of KZFP family include three aspects: (1) 54 The strong specificity of KZFP family across species. Lots of species-specific KZFP 55 genes were reported in human, chimpanzee and other species (Huntley et al., 2006;  The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.041848 doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 these KZFPs are completely structured ( fig. 2C ), suggesting that they have a single 166 and unchangeable function execution pattern and constantly interact with a specific 167 co-factor (such as KAP-1). In another evolutionary path, the key amino acids in the 168 zinc fingers are conserved (that is, KZFPs containing old zinc fingers). However, the 169 KRAB domains of these KZFPs are variable and tend to be disordered ( fig 2C) , 170 suggesting that their KRAB domains are versatile, interacting with multiple proteins. ; supplementary table 4) . 214 Furthermore, we confirmed that MACS2 used in this study is more accurate than 
The zinc finger similarity between each KZFP pairs was calculated according to the 450 method described previously . Briefly, similarity between two 451 zinc finger arrays was defined as sharing the same three amino acids at the 452 DNA-contacting residues, allowing up to one replacement by a related amino acid (as 453 defined by Blosum62). To identify paralogs of human KZFPs based on zinc fingers: 1) 454 for the KZFP which containing 5 or more zinc fingers, the threshold similarity score 455 of 60% and common zinc-fingers of 5 between any two zinc-finger arrays were 456 selected; for the KZFP which containing 4 or less zinc fingers, a threshold similarity 457 score of 100% between any two zinc-finger arrays was selected.
The disorder scores of proteins and domains 459 Structural disorder ration (SDR): The longest protein encoded by each gene was 460 selected as the representative protein for subsequent analyses. IUPred (Dosztanyi, 461 2018) was used to obtain the disorder score of each amino acid in a protein or domain. 462 The disorder rate of a protein is the ratio of the number of disordered amino acids (the 463 disorder score is greater than 0.5) to the total number of amino acids. According to 464 SDR values, proteins can be divided into four classes: completely structured (SDR = 465 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
