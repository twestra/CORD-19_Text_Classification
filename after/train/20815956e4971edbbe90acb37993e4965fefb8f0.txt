The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a public health emergency of international concern and currently is a pandemic. Approximately 15% of patients suffer from severe form of the disease. 1 As of this time there is no known specific, effective and evidence based treatment.
We noted that COVID-19 transmission and mortality are apparently higher in the United States and European countries in contrast to malaria and other infectious diseases endemic regions like South East Asian and African countries.
The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis and apart from providing some protection against development of severe forms of tuberculosis it has been shown to have significant immunomodulatory action and protection against certain viral infections like respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza A (H1N1) and herpes virus. 2 The interaction between exposure to malaria infection and BCG vaccination with incidence of COVID-19 has not been explored.
So, in the absence of any such data, we aimed to analyse the hypothesis regarding the relationship between malaria incidence and BCG coverage with COVID-19 incidence in the world map.
For this cross sectional study, we collected malaria cases and mortality data (2018) from the World Health Organisation (WHO), 3 and worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website. 4 Data on BCG vaccination coverage was accessed from the WHO website and other online sources. 5, 6 Population data was confirmed from the world population website. 7

Statistical analysis: Malaria and COVID-19 incidence rate was calculated as per thousand of population. Deviation from normal distribution was tested with Shapiro-Wilk test. All continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR) as appropriate and discrete data as fraction (percentage). As a first step non-parametric correlation (Kendall's Tau) was calculated between malaria incidence and mortality with COVID-19 incidence. Then COVID-19 incidence was compared between countries, which are malaria free or not.
Similar comparisons were made with BCG vaccination coverage. Mortality of COVID-19 was assessed as per thousand-population in each country. Association of mortality from COVID-19 was tested against malaria incidence and BCG coverage.
To correct for false inflation of mortality rate, mortality analysis was restricted to only those countries reporting more than 100 COVID-19 cases. Comparison of means was done with Mann Whitney U test. A binary logistic regression was run with COVID-19 incidence as dependent variable and the following two variables: malaria free country and BCG vaccination coverage ≤ 95%. Analysis of incidence and mortality of COVID-19 with malaria incidence and BCG coverage was done separately for different geographical location of the countries. Finally, case fatality rate of COVID-19 was analysed in comparison to malaria incidence with non-linear regression.
Overall data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were extracted. Number of malaria cases was 228435738 and number of malaria deaths was 405255. Number of malaria free countries was 81. Number of COVID-19 cases was 412637 and number of COVID-19 deaths was 18559. The median incidence of COVID-19 per thousand All rights reserved.

The COVID-19 incidence was highest in the European/American countries (0.0974, IQR: 0.024-0.33) followed by Asian/Australasian countries (0.0084, IQR: 0.0005-0.077) followed by African countries (0.0015, IQR: 0.0002-0.0045) and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Median case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 1.68% (IQR: 0.39-6.5). Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (tau = -0.513, p<0.001) Malaria mortality rare was also negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (tau= -0.335, p<0.001).
Both total number of COVID-19 cases (7 (IQR 2-89) vs. 249 (86-1492) respectively, p<0.001) and COVID-19 incidence (0.0008 (IQR 0.0001-0.006) vs. 0.09 (IQR: 0.02-0.34) respectively, p<0.001) was lower in countries where malaria occurred versus malaria free countries. Although COVID-19 incidence (0.02 (IQR 0.003-0.11) vs. 0.003 (IQR: 0.0002-0.06) respectively, p=0.01) was significantly higher in countries with >95% BCG coverage compared to countries with ≤ 95% BCG coverage, total All rights reserved.

However in African, Asian and Australasian countries increased BCG coverage was associated with increased COVID-19 incidence and numerically increased mortality. In all geographic locales malaria-free countries had higher COVID-19 incidence.
In non-linear regression of COVID-19 case fatality was compared to malaria incidence in each countries and a quartic equation (R squared=0.527) was the best fit as follows: COVID-19 case fatality = -0.033 + 7.9*(malaria incidence) -0.709*(malaria incidence)^2 + 0.022*(malaria incidence)^3-0.0002*(malaria incidence)^4. Linear regression with transformed malaria incidence as independent variable showed significant association with COVID-19 case fatality (B=0.235, 95%
CI: 0.026-0.444, p=0.029, variance inflation factor=1.0).
The COVID-19 is a new pandemic. We empirically observed that malaria free countries have a higher incidence of COVID-19 among different countries.

Malarial transmission may give some protection against COVID-19. One explanation may be community level use of drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in malaria-endemic countries and relative non-use of them in malaria-free countries. Interestingly chloroquine has been shown to be effective in reduction of viral replications including COVID-19. 8, 9 Hydroxychloroquine has some immunomodulatory action and after the outbreak, studies have shown some activity of this drug. 10 Viral inhibition from possibly higher blood level in malaria-endemic countries is one postulation. The second possible mechanism seems to be immunological. With increasing effort to eliminate and finally eradicate malaria long-term changes may occur in the human immune system.
Possible link between filarial elimination and increased autoimmunity has previously been reported. 11 Whether elimination of parasites leads to permanent changes in the human immune system should be investigated.
Prior BCG vaccination had an apparent paradoxical effect. In the overall analysis lower BCG coverage was associated with lower number of COVID-19 cases.
However this effect is probably related to geographic locale of the countries. In European and American countries, where natural tubercular infection rate was low, higher BCG coverage was associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality. In these countries higher BCG coverage was also associated with numerically lower COVID-19 incidence. On the other hand, in the African, Asian and Australasian continent, where natural TB incidence is higher, increased BCG coverage appeared to have author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In the equation the even powers have negative weights and the odd powers have positive weights.
Thus in areas of non-zero low to very low malaria incidence, the effect of higher powers shall be overwhelmed by the linear terms and an increased COVID-19 case fatality is seen. On the other hand in malaria-endemic countries the reverse is observed.
There are some limitations in this study. Many other parasitic diseases could have been screened, which however due to lack of worldwide data could not be done.
Many factors like underreporting of cases might underwhelm this report.
Socioeconomics is an important factor, which is missing from the current analysis.
To summarize, malaria free countries, worldwide, are experiencing higher burden of COVID-19 pandemic. Among the western countries, those, which have continued high BCG vaccination coverage, have an apparent mortality benefit from COVID-19 infection. However, among the African, Asian and Australasian countries, continued high-level BCG vaccination was associated with increased incidence of and mortality from the COVID-19 infection. From the COVID-19 case fatality analysis a lower mortality could be expected in malaria-endemic countries.
