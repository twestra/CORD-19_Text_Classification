To date no coherent model has emerged to explain, prevent, or treat the rapid respiratory failure that is the proximal cause of death in a minority of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV; SARS-CoV-2; COVID- 19) patients. Similarly, this fact remains true for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) first described by Ashbaugh in 1967 [4] , the severe acute respiratory syndrome Clearly, a small subset of infected individuals rapidly progress, often in a few hours to a few days, from initial symptoms of fever and dyspnea, to full-blown respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, while others remain essentially asymptomatic. Once placed on a ventilator, the death rate has been reported to be between 37 to 62 percent and up to 80 percent depending on age and other risk factors [5] . Currently, the explanation offered to explain these events has been the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) [6] . However, this model is lacking in many .

Using a systems biology frame we conducted a comprehensive review of autopsy work [7] , reports relating to SARS-CoV-2 deaths, and reviewed the literature concerning hyaluronan with respect to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We found that there is a consistent and statistically significant increase in the reported lung weights at autopsy in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 victims with histologic findings of "hyaline membranes", that have classically been described in ARDS, SARS, and MERS autopsies as well. Most significantly, in the first report of two complete autopsies in SARS-CoV-2 in the English language literature, the observed lung weight of a victim with a positive nasopharyngeal and bilateral lung parenchymal swab, by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, weighed 2,452g -approximately 2.5 times the normal adult lung weight. These lungs were described at autopsy to be as a "bag of water" (personal communication) [8] .
In sharp contrast and most importantly, a 42-year-old obese man was determined to have died with SARS-CoV-2 but not because of SARS-CoV-2. At postmortem examination, the nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but there was a negative lung parenchymal swab, with normal lung weights and findings of acute bronchopneumonia, and no hyaline membranes. We believe this may serve to confirm the unique cause of death induced by the super-normal outpouring of hyaluronan over a short time interval and in the confined space of the human chest cavity. We propose to define a new model of the induced hyaluronan storm (IHS) syndrome, as the most comprehensive, specific, and actionable paradigm to frame and address the global SARS-CoV-2 crisis and specifically, to prevent death in high-risk groups.

They further demonstrated up to an 8080% increase in alveolar hyaluronic acid concentration in ARDS patients compared to controls. Stating that "hyaluronic acid is the most powerful water(edema)-binding substance in the body", they put forth a "humoral" and "biochemical-physiological" hypothesis of ARDS [9] . Others have recently detailed the central role of hyaluronic acid in human respiratory disease, in which viral infections lead to marked and rapid increase in hyaluronic acid concentrations [10] - [12] .
McKallip, et al. reported in 2013, in an in vitro and animal model of ARDS that "targeting hyaluronic acid synthesis might be a novel target for the treatment or reduction of...induced lung injury". Using an elegant combination of cell based and murine studies, they showed it was possible to profoundly suppress the production of hyaluronan by inhibiting the three isoenzymes of hyaluronan synthase-HAS-1, HAS-2, and HAS-3 with 4-MU (4-methylumbelliferone) [13] .
A follow up study by the same group went on to show that "4-MU (a non-toxic molecule) reduces expression of HAS-1, HAS-2, and HAS-3 (the enzymes that produce HA), and reduced levels of HA in the lungs of SEB-exposed mice" and that "4-MU (4-methylumbelliferone) treatment led to a reduction in SEB-induced lung permeability, and reduced cytokine production" [14] .
Bray and others in 1991 demonstrated in a bleomycin-induced lung injury model, maximal hyaluronan content was reached after seven days and was 14.6 fold the normal value [15] . Reeves et al. in 2020, showed that human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) treated with viral mimetic polyinosine-polycytidylic acid, a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, encourages the accumulation of hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and enhances monocyte and lymphocyte binding. It was shown that the activity of mast cells (innate immune cells), particularly in acute respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can lead to the formation of a hyaluronan-enriched ECM. This further emphasizes that RSV infections of .

HLFs encourages inflammation via hyaluronan-dependent mechanisms that enhance mast cell protease expression through direct contact with the has been shown that hyaluronan ECM [16] . It and its various degradation products in vitro are a significant contributor to the immunomodulatory functions of the ECM in both acute and chronic respiratory diseases.
Paul Bollyky, M.D., PhD. and Nadine Nagy PhD. et al., researchers at Stanford, extensively reviewed the use of Cantabilin® in 2015 in both animal and human studies in terms of its mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety with respect to cancer and autoimmunity.
These researchers reported on eight human studies dating back to 1978 involving hyaluronan and ca ncer. They concluded that "there is a potential for hymecromone to be developed and repurposed as a safe, long-term adjunctive therapy for cancer treatment or other potential indication."

Average lung weights were plotted on MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Post-hoc analysis using the Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) to indicate group statistical significance, provided 95 percent confidence intervals between the groups. It is important to note that performing the Tukey HSD test requires a studentized range distribution. Due to limited number of lung weights in confirmed IHS SARS-CoV-2 victims, we cannot determine a p-value at this ± point. However, it is clearly observed that the lung weights seen between IHS+ and IHSautopsies is 2:1, which we believe is indicative of a significant difference. One COVID-19 IHS+ case was recorded with a combined lung 1940g [18] . .

We employed a systems biology ather than a reductionist approach, to better [7] , r characterize and understand the mechanisms associated with the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. We propose that a hyperacute rise in hylauronan concentration is the Under appreciated and neglected since the first description of the clinical features of ARDS based on careful autopsy results in 1967 [4] , the morphologic and spacial implications of the sudden outpouring of hyaluronic acid and it's sequestration of water in the alveolar environment, has not been fully appreciated and specifically addressed. There are many ways that an insult, and the response to that insult, can be characterized and quantified-morphologically, physiologically, molecularly, biochemically, and genetically, for example. Unfortunately, the focus currently and historically, has centered on the down stream consequences, and not the critical and key physical dimension and spacial aspects of a large volume of accumulated and misplaced water in the lung. Essentially the lung parenchyma, as a direct consequence of massive increases in hyaluronan, rapidly becomes saturated with water.
These shifts in water have been demonstrated to begin to occur within minutes, as a direct result of a variety injuries, and in this case, yet unknown and particularly lethal aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and can within minutes, lead to changes that result in acute respiratory distress requiring ventilation within hours.

These findings, and numerous others, all suggest that treatments targeting the production of hyaluronan may be life-saving in the present pandemic. The beneficial effects of 4-MU in patients that are currently on ventilators, and certainly in symptomatic patients who have not crossed the line into respiratory failure, is strongly suggested by the extant literature.
Fortunately, evidence exists that 4-MU which has been readily available in Eurpean Union as an over the counter product, called Cantabilin®, with a current marketing authorization via the Italian Medicines Agency (AIC no. 02130002) might be available for use.
Given the weight of these findings as well as the long track record of the safe use of 4-methylumbelliferone, and particularly the pressing need and current lack of a specific treatment for COVID-19 ARDS, we propose that those on the front lines, (especially in Italy and Spain) consider immediate use of 4-MU under compassionate use guidelines.
The work of Paul Bollyky, M.D., PhD. and Nadine Nagy PhD. et al., would suggest that 800 mg by mouth three times per day at first sign of infection in confirmed high risk patients might be a reasonable initial dose [17] . These finding provide a rational for studying the use of 4-methylumbelliferone in COVID-19 induced hyaluronan storm in prospective, double-blinded clinical trials in high-risk patients, which we strongly recommend start in the earliest time frame possible, and encourage all readers to recommend specific protocols for doing so. All drugs have unanticipated and unwanted side effects and great caution must be taken in the clinical application of this or any compound in COVID-19. Certainly, 4-MU should only be used under the direct supervision of skilled physicians.

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 19.20071647 doi: medRxiv preprint Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease has resulted in a disastrous pandemic of enormous consequences, the likes of which have not been seen in modern times. We propose that the induced hyaluronan storm syndrome or IHS, is the model that best addresses the heretofore perplexing respiratory failure that is the proximal cause of death in a minority, but ever rising number, of patients. We encourage researchers and clinicians to put our model to the test, and expand upon our early understanding of this disease. In addition to treating and preventing IHS in currently infected individuals now; an aggressive research effort should be undertaken to discover why the majority of individuals who are exposed to the virus are either minimally or asymptomatic, while a minority of high-risk individuals rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death. The answer to this question will have profound implications for our fundamental understanding and approach to disease, and for the individuals and institutions charged with the management of this and future threats to global health and well-being.
Foundations have been shaken, and the future will be profoundly shaped by these historic events, as history has been shaped by similar events in the past. Let us hope our collective responses are enlightened, cooperative, and well reasoned . Future directions include the [18] reporting of further IHS SARS-CoV-2 lung weights and performing additional autopsies on ± SARS-CoV-2 victims. We recommend the measurement of hyaluronic acid in serum as a potential indicator of IHS status.
