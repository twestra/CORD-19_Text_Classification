SARS-CoV-2 has recently been detected in feces, which indicates that wastewater may be used to monitor viral prevalence in the community. Here we use two different sampling methods to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater over a 17-day period and sequencing is used to infer viral ancestry. While SARS-CoV-2 is detected over the entire time course, viral RNA has been steadily decreasing over the last week, suggesting that state mandated social isolation is having a measurable impact on containment of the outbreak.
over 181 countries across all continents except Antarctica. The global total of infected individuals now exceeds 1.8 million (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).
Public health professionals around the world are working to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and "flatten the curve", which requires a reduction in cases from one day to the next. However, SARS-CoV-2 containment has been outpaced by viral spread and limited resources for testing. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that the virus is not only spread by aerosols, but may also be transmitted via feces (Hindson, 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Xu, 2020) . This has important implications for the spread of the virus and suggests that wastewater may be used to monitor progression or abetment of viral spread at the community level (Mallapaty, 2020) . To test this hypothesis, we collected three 0.5-liter samples of pre-treated wastewater from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Bozeman, Montana (USA). Samples were collected on 7 different days over the course of a 17-day period, using two different collection methods. The samples were filtered and concentrated prior to RNA extraction. Isolated RNA was used as a template for one-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) according to CDC recommended guidelines (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/ download). Each RT-qPCR reaction was performed using two primer pairs (i.e., N1, and N2), each targeting distinct regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1 and Supplemental Fig 1) . The first two samples were collected manually, using a sampling stick on the mornings of March 23 rd and 27 th , respectively. While samples collected on these two occasions all tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the estimated .

We hypothesized that this variability was due to the sampling method, so subsequent sampling was performed using an autosampler that collects a volume proportional to flow, every hour for 24hours. This 24-hour composite sample was then divided into three 0.5-liter aliquots. Like the previous samples, these samples also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1B) .
Viral titers in composite samples were lower than from previous samples collected manually, but there was considerably less variation between replicates. This indicates that the previously noted variability was due to the sampling method, rather than inconsistencies associated with RNA extraction or the RT-qPCR assay.
To verify the RT-qPCR results and determine the phylogenetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the Bozeman waste stream, we used 10 primer pairs that tile across the SARS-CoV-2 genome to PCR amplify phylogenetically informative regions (Quick, 2020) . These primers were designed to target conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that flank polymorphic sites that have been used to trace viral ancestry and geographic origins (Quick, 2020) (Fig 1C and Supplemental Fig 2) . RNA isolated from the Bozeman waste stream on March 27 th was used as a template for RT-PCR. All 10 primer pairs produced PCR products of the expected sizes (Fig 1C) . PCR products were sequenced using Sanger methods and the reads were aligned to the reference genome using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004; Wu et al., 2020a) . We observed no sequence heterogeneity in redundant reads derived from each location of the genome, which suggests the predominance of a single SARS-CoV-2 genotype in the waste stream at the time of sampling.

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 To determine viral ancestry, we aligned sequences isolated from the Bozeman wastewater to 2,399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes that have been determined from 59 different countries (Hadfield et al., 2018) . While nine of the thirteen positions analyzed in our sample showed no mutations relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 sequence (Fig 2C   and Supplemental Fig 2) , four mutations are characteristic of sequences from Europe (Fig 2A and Fig 2C) . One mutation in particular (G25563T) predominates in the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from France, but is absent in the majority of samples from any other country (Fig 2A) . The conservation of these four mutations suggests a shared phylogenetic history between virus in the Bozeman wastewater and SARS-CoV-2 that is most recently derived from Europe.
In addition to position-specific mutation analysis, we also concatenated each of the ten sequences generated by PCR and then performed a phylogenetic analysis. Similar to the position-specific analysis, this approach indicates that the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains in Bozeman's wastewater are most closely related to those from Europe, specifically strains from France and Iceland (Fig 2B and C) . By scaling the phylogenetic data according to viral isolation dates, Hadfield et al previously showed that the G25563T mutation, which predominates specifically in France, arose more recently than the other mutations (Hadfield et al., 2018) . This suggests that the predominate strain currently circulating in Bozeman may have originated in France. While our sequencing approach was designed to target phylogenetically informative positions, additional .

Collectively, the results presented here demonstrate that municipal wastewater can be used to monitor the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community over time. Our data indicated that the sampling method is critical and that composite samples may provide the most reliable daily average of viral concentration in wastewater over time. Bozeman is a relatively small community (~50,000) and SARS-Cov-2 was not detected in Montana until March 12 nd , 2020. While the time course presented here is relatively short, we note a statistically significant increase in SARS-Cov-2 RNA between the first (March 30 th ) and the second composite sample tested (April 1 st , 2020), and then a gradual reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the next three time points (i.e., April 3 rd , 6 th and 8 th , 2020). While temporal sampling is ongoing, the data collected thus far, reveal an encouraging trend, which suggests that community prevalence is currently on the decline.

Pre-treated wastewater samples were collected from influent at the Bozeman Water Reclamation Facility (WRF). Grab samples were collected in triplicates with 15 second intervals from the wastewater stream. Composite samples were collected with automatic flow proportional sampler to capture average characteristics of wastewater over a period of 24 hours. Each wastewater sample (500 mL) was sequentially filtered through 20 ÂµM, 5 ÂµM (Sartorius Biolab Products) and 0.45 ÂµM (Pall Corporation) membrane filters and concentrated down to 150-200 ÂµL using Corning Spin-X UF concentrators with 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off. Total RNA from concentrated samples was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with 40 ÂµL elution volume and used as a template for RT-qPCR.
RT-qPCR was performed using two primers pairs (N1 and N2) and probes from 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit (IDT#10006606). SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was detected and quantified using one-step RT-qPCR in ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System according to CDC guidelines and protocols (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). 20 ÂµL reactions included 8.5 ÂµL of Nuclease-free Water, 1.5 ÂµL of Primer and Probe mix, 5 ÂµL of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher, A15299) and 5 ÂµL of the template. Nuclease-free water was used as negative template control (NTC).
Amplification was performed as follows: 25Â°C for 2 min, 50Â°C for 15 min, 95 Â°C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 Â°C for 3 s and 55 Â°C for 30 s. To quantify viral genome copy .

Three technical replicates were performed at each dilution. The detection limit was down to 10 copies of the control plasmid. Run data was analyzed in SDS software v1.4 (Applied Biosystems). Threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by manually adjusting threshold to fall within exponential phase of the fluorescence curves and above any background signal. 
Reverse transcription was performed with 10 ÂµL of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive grab wastewater samples using SuperScriptâ„¢ III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the supplier's instructions. Resulting cDNA was used as a template to amplify regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome with following previously published primer pairs (Supplemental Table 1 ) (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bbmuik6w ) .

PCR products were analyzed on 1 % agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR products were purified using DNA Clean & Concentratorâ„¢ kit (Zymo Research) and sent to Psomagen for Sanger sequencing.
Each PCR product was sequenced with both forward and reverse primer used for PCR.
SNP analysis was conducted by aligning thirty-three Sanger reads to the genome of Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (Wu et al., 2020a) and comparing nucleotides at positions that have previously been used to trace ancestry (Hadfield et al., 2018) . SNP abundances for SARS-CoV-2 genomes from each country were calculated in R using the BioStrings package (PagÃ¨s et al., 2019) , and chromatograms of Sanger sequencing reads were rendered in SnapGene (GSL Biotech; available at snapgene.com).
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by concatenating Sanger reads covering each of the thirteen positions of interest. This concatemer, and its component thirty three sequences, were aligned to 2,550 SARS-CoV-2 genomes retrieved from GISAID on 3/29/2020, 1:25:22 PM (https://www.gisaid.org/), using the FFT-NS-2 setting in MAFFT v7.429 (Katoh et al., 2019; Shu and McCauley, 2017) . The alignment was optimized using MaxAlign v1.1, which removed 150 gapped sequences (Gouveia-Oliveira et al., 2007) . Columns composed of more than 50% gaps were removed with trimAl v1.2rev59 (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009) .
