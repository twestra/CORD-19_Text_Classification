Summary of the epidemiological history of the patients 90 The samples of the 11 patients involved in this study were collected during the early 91 phase of the COVID-19 breakout in China, dates ranging from 1/22/2020 to 2/4/2020 92 ( Table 1) . 10 of the 11 patients had clear connections with Wuhan city, where the 93 SARS-CoV-2 was originally identified. 5 of the 11 people either worked in or traveled to 94 Wuhan before they were diagnosed, and another 5 had close contact with people who 95 lived in Wuhan, and the remaining person had contact with people who were COVID-19 96 victims. Notably, patients ZJU-4, -5, -9 attended the same business conference where a 97 few colleagues from Wuhan were present. These patients therefore constitute 1st and 2nd 98 generations of the viral victims based on their epidemiological history. The 11 patients 99 include 8 males and 3 females, with ages ranging from 4 months to 71 years old. There 100 are no clear criteria in selecting these patients other than the fact that they were all 101 admitted into Zhejiang University-affiliated hospitals in Hangzhou.

This extraordinary depth is partially due to the 115 small genome of the SARS-CoV-2, which enables us to identify mutations with high 116 confidence. Moreover, in cases where the viral populations are not homogenous, the 117 depth could help us to characterize alleles with very low frequency. 118 In total, 33 mutations were identified (including 10 mutations observed in 119 mixed-populations), and 19 of these mutations were novel, according to the comparison 120 with 1111 genomic sequences available at GISAID on 3/24/2020 ( Fig. 1 , S1, and S2). 121 Specifically, G11083T and G26144T were found in ZJU-1, and both of these mutations 122 are known as founding mutations for a large group of viruses (Capobianchi et al., 2020) . 123 C8782T and T28144C were found in two of our viral isolates, ZJU-2 and ZJU-8, and 124 these two are known as the founding mutations for another large group of viral isolates 125 (Capobianchi et al., 2020) . Interestingly, mutation T22303G was found in five viral 126 isolates (ZJU-2, -5, -9, -10, and -11) and ZJU-5 and ZJU-9 were exposed to the same 127 potential source of infection during a business conference (Table 1) . Previously, only one 128 viral isolate identified in Australia had the T22303G mutation. Strikingly, the viral isolate 129 from patient ZJU-4, who attended the same conference as ZJU-5 and ZJU-9, has a novel 130 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

At 48 hours P.I., we 263 observed small decreases for all viral isolates except for ZJU-10 and ZJU-11, both of 264 which had presumably already plateaued at 24 hours P.I. (Fig. 3A and B) . Notably, at 24 265 hours P.I., ZJU-2 and ZJU-8, members of the ORF-8-L84S cluster (majority of USA 266 WA-Seattle isolates are in this group), showed considerably lower viral loads (Fig. 4A) . 267 On the other hand, ZJU-1, which clusters with the S-D614G clade (mostly found in 268 Europe), has a viral load 19 times (2 4.25 ) higher than ZJU-2 and ZJU-8 (Fig. 4A) . In 269 addition, a near 270-fold difference (2 8.09 ) in viral load was observed between ZJU-10 270 and ZJU-2 at 24 hours P.I. (Fig. 4A ). These differences became statistically significant at their genomes, exhibit a significant variation of viral load when infecting Vero-E6 cells. 274 We next examined whether a higher viral load leads to more cell death (Fig. 4B) . 275 When examining these cell lines under a microscope at 48 hours and 72 hours P.I., the 276 CPE, or the cell death rate, are highly consistent with the viral load data ( Fig. 4C and S5B, 277 C, and D; at 48 hours P.I., Ct vs CPE, R = -0.72, p = 0.015), indicating that a higher viral 278 load leads to a higher cell death ratio.

Although the Vero-E6 cell line was not derived from human, the ACE2 protein 316 of the Vero-E6 cell line is highly similar to that of Human (Fig. S6) and we provided 317 direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cell line (Fig. 2B) . 318 Several findings stand out in our study: 1. A diverse collection of mutations was 319 identified in the 11 viral isolates, including two sets of founding mutations for two major 320 clusters of viruses currently infecting the world population. In addition, 19 of the 31 321 identified mutations are novel, despite the relatively early sampling dates, indicating that 322 the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated; 2. remarkably, the 323 T22303G and A22301C mutations result in the same S247R mutation in the S protein 324 ( Fig. 1 and S1 ), mapping to the existing structure revealed that this residue is located in a 325 flexible loop region within the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of S protein, 326 although the exact position of S247 could not be determined (Fig. S7, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 19, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20060160 doi: medRxiv preprint 24 despite the fact that it is still largely missing from current GISAID collection. This could 333 be due to the founding effect of mutations, in which case the T22303G mutation was not 334 transmitted out of the China during the early days; 3. The tri-nucleotide mutation in 335 ZJU-11 is unexpected; we note that this specific viral isolate is quite potent in our viral 336 load and CPE assay, and its patient remained positive for an astounding period of 45 days 337 and was only recently discharged from the hospital (Table 1) . Investigating the functional 338 impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting. We note that in the 339 current database, another trinucleotide mutation (G28881A, G2882A and G28883C) has 340 been identified, which also results in two missense mutations at the protein level (Fig. S8) . 341 It leads to a cluster of more than 300 viral strains as of the time of writing this article, and 342 its mutational impact on the viral pathogenicity would be worth investigating. Finally, in 343 contrary to the recent report that a viable viral isolate could not be obtained from stool 344 samples, three of our viral isolated were extracted from stool samples, indicating that the 345 SARS-CoV-2 is capable of replicating in stool samples (Woelfel et al., 2020) . 346 In short, our study provides direct evidence that mutations currently occurring in the 347 SARS-CoV-2 genome have the functional potential to impact the viral pathogenicity. 348 Therefore, viral surveillance should be also performed at the cellular level when possible, 349 All rights reserved.
