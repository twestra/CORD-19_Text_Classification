The ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-kB repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.
protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with human ACE2 expressed on human airway epithelia to facilitate virus entry [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, host targets for other viral proteins remain largely unknown, which limits our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion and pathogenesis, further impeding anti-viral drug development and design of therapeutic approaches.
Limited by their relatively small genomes, viral proteins form different combinations of protein complexes to fulfill a variety of critical functions during viral life cycle, making the investigation of intra-viral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) a requirement. To systematically characterize the intra-viral PPI networks, both genome-wide yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screens and co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) experiments with SARS-CoV-2 genes were performed. All the predicted viral genes were synthesized based on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN908947). The entire library was cloned into Y2H DNA-binding domain (pACT2) and activation domain (pGBTK7) vectors and then transformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain (Clontech). Nsp3 was truncated into two smaller fragments in this experiment since large genes tend to yield fewer interactions in the Y2H assay. All the possible pair-wise combinations were examined independently for the activation of the reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2 in triplicates. We captured 19 PPIs from the Y2H screens, including nsp15-nsp2, ORF7b-nsp1, N-nsp4, ORF3a-nsp4, ORF7b-nsp7, nsp7-nsp8, nsp12-nsp8, nsp7-nsp9, nsp14-nsp10, nsp16-nsp10, ORF6-nsp14, E-E, N-E, ORF3a-E, ORF9b-E, N-N, nsp7-ORF7a, nsp8-ORF8, and ORF9b-ORF9b (Extended Data Fig.1) . The Co-IP assay resulted in the identification of 52 PPIs (Extended Data Fig.1-2) . Some of the interactions between viral proteins, such as the association between nsp12 and nsp8, were detected by both Y2H and co-IP. Some viral proteins, such as M, N, E, nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b, and ORF10 displayed self-association, suggesting their dimer or oligomer forms may carry out important functions during infection. In total, we characterized 58 distinct intra-viral PPIs amongst 28 SARS-CoV-2 genes that may promote virus replication and can be expected to be important to immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. (Fig.1a) .
Among the 4 classical structural proteins, 3 PPIs were detected (Fig.1b) ; these interactions of structural proteins may be critical in the organization of viral particles during viral replication and assembly. We also found 8 PPIs between structural proteins and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b, and ORF10) and 6 PPIs between structural proteins and non-structural proteins (nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, and nsp16) (Fig. 1b) , These PPI may play a pivotal role in viral structural protein processing, modification, and trafficking, supporting their importance for viral particle assembly and egress.
While structural proteins are components for the capsid and the envelope of the virus, several nonstructural proteins (nsps), such as nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 have associated enzymatic activities essential for viral RNA replication and viral protein translation. In addition, nsps can function as virulence factors that inhibit the host's immune system defenses. We speculate that the relatively large number of nsp interactions detected (12) might imply a crucial role of nsps in the formation of multimeric complexes during the viral life cycle (Fig.1c) . The SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (the precursor of all 16 nsps) shares 94.4% amino acid identity to SARS-CoV ORF1ab. A number of structural studies posits the methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 or nsp16 are facilitated by nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 associations, respectively 16, 17 , which are also observed in SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our intra-viral PPI network provides the foundation to dissect the role of these viral proteins in mediating the synthesis, assembly and processing of viral proteins for both SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV. Disruption of these intra-viral PPIs by repurposing small molecule or peptide drugs that target specific epitopes can be a treatment strategy against COVID-19 18 .
To better understand the roles of these viral proteins during the virus life cycle, it is pivotal to establish the SARS-CoV-2-host interactome in human cells. We overexpressed the plasmids encoding each SARS-CoV-2 encoded gene with N-terminal 3xFlag-epitope in HEK293 cells and purified each SARS-CoV-2 protein complex by affinity purification. Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS). From AP-LC-MS analysis, 251 cellular proteins were identified to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, resulting in 631 high-confidence interactions ( Fig.2 and Table 1 ). We identified previously reported proteins that had bona fide associations with SARS-CoV proteins, such as ROA0 and subunits of the ATPase (AT1A1 and AT1A2) 19 , further substantiating these cellular processes as vital targets of the coronavirus family. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins also interacts with the subunits of 40S ribosomal proteins (RS5, RS10, RS12, RS14, RS17, RS18, and RS27), T complex proteins (TCPA, TCPD, TCPE, TCPG, TCPH, TCPQ, and TCPZ), and proteasome-related proteins (PRS4, PRS7, PRS8, PSA, PSA4, PSA6, PSA7, PSD11, PSD13, PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD6, and PSMD7). These viral-cellular protein interactions might have extensive cytopathic effects on the host cell, often altering host gene translation, protein folding, and degradation pathways during viral infection to assist viral growth and proliferation (Extended Data Fig.3a-b) . The virus may also coopt the complex membranous network surrounding and residing within the host cell, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membranes, so long as the membrane systems possess host proteins that lead to a productive infection (Fig.2 ). Most importantly, the AP-LC-MS analysis uncovered host targets pertinent in inflammatory and innate immune responses, which may help explain the common respiratory symptoms. Key viral-cellular PPIs that may influence the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 include interaction between NKRF (an endogenous repressor of IL-8/IL-6 synthesis) and nsp9/nsp10/nsp12/nsp13/nsp15 20,21 , C1QBP (involved in complement C1 activation) and nsp9/nsp10 22 , G3BP2 (anti-viral stress granule protein) and N 23 , and RAE1 (an interferon-inducible mRNA nuclear export protein) and ORF6 24 . These observations provide an overview of host proteins or pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and these PPIs might serve as potential targets for drug development or repurposing against COVID-19.
To elucidate the mechanism and effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, we determined the global proteome profile changes in PBMCs samples taken from healthy donors compared with PBMCs collected from COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms. The PBMC samples were obtained from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and includes 6 healthy donors, 22 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms (COVID-19-MS), and 13 COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (COVID-19-SS) (Extended Data Fig.4 ). PBMCs were harvested from the leftover blood samples and all the patients were confirmed negative for influenza A virus. Following the Guideline of Novel Coronavirus Laboratory Safety (Edition 2), PBMCs were collected, lysed in denaturing buffer (see Methods) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and sent for proteome analysis at the National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai.
A total of 6,739 proteins were identified in our study, of which 4,274 proteins could be quantified in all 26 PMBCs samples. Proteins with less than three quantitation values did not pass filtering threshold and were excluded from the quantitation and statistical analysis. 5,522 proteins were quantified according to criteria and included in global proteomic profiling to reveal a list of 220 proteins found to be differentially expressed [|log2 (fold change)| ≥ 1, n≥3] in the PBMCs of COVID-19-MS compared with that of healthy donors: 115 proteins showed a statistically significant increase while 105 proteins showed reduction in expression when comparing COVID-19-MS with control. (Fig.3a, Extended Data Fig.5a-b and Table 2 ). Functional analysis by DAVID and Cluster Profiler revealed that these genes were enriched in specific cellular biological processes, including positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil activation, type I interferon signaling pathway, inflammatory response, and antigen processing and presentation ( Fig.3b and Extended Data Fig.5c-d) , suggesting an active innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of the global proteomic changes reveal significant upregulation of CXCR2, PRG3, LBP, MMP25, CRP, NLRP1 in the COVID-19-MS author/funder. All rights reserved.

CXCR2 is a subunit of IL-8 receptor and facilitates IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis while PRG3 has been reported to stimulate neutrophil superoxide production and IL-8 release 25, 26 . LBP positively regulates neutrophil response upon LPS stimulation and MMP25 inactivates alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor to facilitate the trans-endothelial migration of neutrophil to inflammatory sites during infection 27, 28 . These differentially expressed proteins support a model by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine release, such as IL-8, in the early stage of infection, resulting in uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils to the sites of infection followed by eventual progression to cytokine storm and respiratory distress. Indeed, laboratory results reveal increased neutrophils to ~90% of the white blood cell count as COVID-19 progresses to critical stages 11, 12 . The elevation of IL-8 and IL-6 but not IL-17 in PMBCs collected from COVID-19 patients indicates possible roles for IL-8/IL-6 in the severe inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3d-e and Extended Data Fig.5e ).
Next, we compared the proteome change between PBMCs isolated from COVID-19-SS and COVID-19-MS patients. Amongst 6,235 quantified proteins (n≥3), 553 proteins were found to be significantly differentially expressed [|log2 (fold change)| ≥ 1, adjusted two-sided p Value ≤0.05] between COVID-19SS and COVID-19 MS's PMBCs. 27 of these proteins were upregulated and 526 of these proteins were downregulated in COVID-19-SS as compared to COVID-19-MS (Fig.3f, Extended Data Fig.6a-b and Table 3 ). Functional analysis by DAVID and Cluster Profiler revealed that these genes are highly enriched in pathways associated with regulation of immune response, T cell co-stimulation and activation, complement activation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling ( Fig.3g and Extended Data Fig.6c-d) . The expressions of T cell receptor (TCR) subunits (CD3e, CD3g, CD247, TRAC, and TRBC1), T cell surface molecules (CD4, CD8a, CD8b, and CD2), MHC class II molecules (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4, and HLA-DRB5), T cell migration stimulators (DDP4), and TCR signaling kinases (ZAP70, LCK, and FYN) were dramatically diminished in COVID-19-SS as compared to COVID-19-MS (Fig.3a,h) , suggesting a failure of T cells activation and function. The expressions of immunoglobulin subunits (IGHG1, IGHG2, IGHG4, IGLC2, IGLL1, and IGHE) were also significant lower in COVID-19-SS (Fig.3a,h) , indicating reduced antibody secretion by B cells. These results demonstrated that more severe COVID-19 patients undergo a functional decline in adaptive immunity, which is correlated with their lower T cell and B cell populations 11, 12 .
From the quantitative proteome analysis of PBMCs, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-8/IL-6 expression and increases neutrophil count which may mediate the manifestation of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors may potentiate or regulate the induction of IL-8/IL-6 during infection, leading to the uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils. NKRF is a transcriptional repressor that inhibit IL-8 and IL-6 induction by competing with NF-kB for promoter binding 20,21,29 . From our virus-host interactome, we discovered that NKRF interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nsp9, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 ( Fig.2 and Extended Data Fig.7a ). Among these SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, individually expressed nsp9 or nsp10 facilitated the induction of both IL-8 and IL-6 in lung epithelial A549 cells, while individually expressed nsp12, nsp13, or nsp15 had little or no effects (Fig. 3i-j) . The levels of TNFa was not affected by either nsp9 or nsp10 (Extended Data Fig.7b) , suggesting nsp9 and nsp10 does not affect NK-kB signaling transduction overall. Importantly, NKRF deficiency by specific siRNA facilitated the induction of IL-8 and diminished the effect of nsp10, indicating that nsp10 potentially targeted NKRF to regulate IL-8 induction (Extended Data Fig.7c-d) .
Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has underwent rapid adaptive changes against evolutionary pressures since its isolation 30 . Phylogenetic and genetic analysis 31 of 160 public SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals 137 amino acid substitutions in 23 viral proteins with no mutations occurring in nsp9 (Extended Data Fig.7e and Table 4) , which indicates nsp9 has remained relatively stable. Unlike nsp9, nsp10 picked up only two amino acid substitutions (A61G and F68L), but with very low variation rate (1/160 for each site) during author/funder. All rights reserved.

Our study integrated virus-host interaction network and quantitative proteome approaches to identify host targets of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 evolved multiple mechanisms to modulate host fundamental cellular processes, which ultimately contributes to its immune evasion and pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the PBMC proteome profile in both mild and severe cases of COVID-19, corroborating the overall clinical features of COVID-19 patients at molecular levels. These systematic analyses not only generate groundwork for future SARS-CoV-2 research on the nature of this virus but also provide valuable targets for specific drug development or repurposing. With these platforms, we identified nsp9 and nsp10 as the potential virulence factors for SARS-CoV-2, which interacts with NKRF to facilitate IL-8/IL-6 induction, ultimately leading to uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils (Fig.4) . Specific agents targeting IL-8/IL-6 or the downstream JAK kinases could be repurposed as suitable drug candidates for clinical evaluation. These small molecule inhibitors (i.e. IL-6 or IL-8 receptor antagonists) or agents blocking virulence factor PPIs would have enormous value as anti-virulence therapies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections (Fig.4) .

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (#YJ-2020-S052-02). The proteomic analysis of PBMC samples were performed on existing samples collected during standard diagnostic tests, posing no extra burden to patients.
HEK293 and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL) containing 4 mM glutamine and 10% FBS. Vero cells were cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS and 4 mM glutamine. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #3000015). SARS-CoV-2 genes were synthesized as DNA fragments (Sangon Biotech) and these expression constructs were amplified by PCR and cloned into pLVX-3xFlag-MCS-P2A-tagRFP (puro), pEF-MCS-3xHA, pGBTK7, or pACT2 vectors. Mutations of nsp10 were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer to verify 100% correspondence with the original sequence. Primary antibodies were purchased from the following venters: mouse anti-Flag
HEK293 were transfected with 3xFlag-tagged plasmids encoding each SARS-CoV-2 protein by Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L3000015). 3x10 7 HEK293 cells were harvested in 10 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitors and protease inhibitors) at 72 h post transfection, followed by centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm) to remove debris. Cell lysates were precleared with 100 μl protein A/G resin, and then incubated with 25 μl anti-Flag M2 resin (Sigma, #F2426) for 12 h at 4°C on a rotator. The resin was washed 5 times and transferred to a spin column with 40 μl of 3 X Flag peptide (Sigma, #F4799) for 1 h at 4°C on a rotator. The purified complexes were sent for mass spectrometry analysis for protein-protein interaction network at the National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai.
The samples (purified complexes) were precipitated by TCA and resolved in 8 M urea, and then treated with 5 mM TCEP and 10 mM IAA to reduce the disulfide bonds and alkylate the resulting thiol groups, sequentially. The mixture was digested for 16 h at 37 °C by trypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (wt/wt). The trypsindigested peptides were desalted by monospin C18 and loaded on a home-made 40 cm-long pulled-tip analytical column (75 μm ID x 360μm OD, ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin, Dr. Maisch GmbH), connected to a Thermo Easy-nLC1000 HPLC system. The samples were analyzed with a 120 min-HPLC gradient from 0 to 100% of buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water; buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) at 300 nL/min：4-8 min, 0%-4% B;1-96 min, 8-35% B; 97-104min, 35-60% B; 104-105min, 60-100% B; 105-120min, 100% B. The eluted peptides were ionized and directly introduced into a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer using a nano-spray source with a distal 2.0-kV spray voltage. Survey full-scan MS spectra (from m/z 300-1,800) was acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with resolution r = 70,000 at m/z 200. One acquisition cycle includes one full-scan MS spectrum followed by top 20 MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first to the twentieth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum at a 28% normalized collision energy. The acquired MS/MS data were analyzed against a UniProtKB Human database (database released on Sept. 30, 2018) containing SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using Maxquant V1.6.10.43. In order to accurately estimate peptide probabilities and false discovery rates (FDR), we used a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the author/funder.
