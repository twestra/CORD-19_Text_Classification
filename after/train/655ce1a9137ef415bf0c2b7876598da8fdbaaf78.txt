The virus that was first discovered in China Wuhan Province about 3 months ago (first cases were reported in Wuhan on December 31st 2019) has spread world wide. The six (6) top countries (excluding China) most affected so far include; USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Iran. With Italy showing the highest death toll.
In Uganda where it was discovered on 19/3/2020 with one (01) case has just in nine (9) days, increased to thirty (30) infected individuals. This model is a wake up call over the rate at which COVID-19 is likely to spread throughout the country. Thus it is a guide for policymakers and planners to benchmark on for solutions to this deadly virus.
advance to a severe pneumonia triggering shortness of breath [13] . From the time of exposure/contact to virus, symptoms may take up to two (2) weeks [1-14 days ] to show up [11] . In severe cases the disease may consequently lead to death [12] .
The top 6 countries reporting the most outside China, globally, Table 1 and Table 2 [9]. The mortality due to COVID-19 varies from country to country, the age and health of the population seem to be aged above 60 years old [6] . Confirmed .

Let the infected population at time t be I(t) = I. We assume the rate of increase of the infected population ( dI dt ) to be directly proportional to the infected population (I).
From eqn (1),
