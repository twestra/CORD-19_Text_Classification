Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an acute threat to public health 22 and the world economy, especially because no approved specific drugs or vaccines are available. Compound-based targeting of cellular proteins that are essential for the virus life cycle has led to the 50 discovery of broadly reactive drugs against a range of CoVs (3-6). As virus propagation strongly 51 depends on energy and catabolic substrates of host cells, drug target identification should consider 52 the metabolism of infected cells (3). Autophagy, a highly conserved cytosolic degradation process of 53 long-lived proteins, lipids, and organelles in eukaryotic cells, is tightly controlled by metabolism (7, 8).
During autophagy, intracellular macromolecules are recycled by incorporation into LC3B-lipidated 55 autophagosomes (AP) and degradation into their monomers, such as fatty and amino acids, after 56 fusion with low pH lysosomes (9). In the case of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome 57 (MERS)-CoV, we recently showed that autophagy is limited by a virus-induced AKT1-dependent 58 activation of the E3-ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), which targets the key autophagy 59 initiating protein Beclin-1 (BECN1) for proteasomal degradation (10). Congruently, inhibition of SKP2 60 by different compounds, including clinically approved drugs, stabilized BECN1 and limited MERS-CoV 61 propagation, indicating that autophagy-inducing compounds hold promise for evaluation as antiviral 62 drugs. This paper investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cell metabolism and the 63 downstream effects on autophagy, thereby identifying multiple targets for the application of approved 64 drugs and the development of new antiviral therapies.
We aimed to characterize the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on autophagy by applying previously 66 established assays (10) and additionally including detailed analyses of upstream autophagy regulators 67 according to expert-curated guidelines for detecting autophagy (11). First, we explored whether SARS- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.997254 doi: bioRxiv preprint fusion of APs with lysosomes to autophagy-active autophagolysosomes (AL) (11). Based on our 74 previous experience (10), we chose a low MOI of 0.0005 and time points 8, 24, and 48 hours post 75 infection to monitor autophagy during the exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 reaching maximum titers 76 of 10 7 genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml; NCI-H1299) and 10 10 GE/ml (VeroFM) at 48 hours post 77 infection ( Figure S1a) . We found that 100 nM of BafA1 was sufficient to induce maximal LC3B lipidation 78 levels in both cell cultures (Figure S1b-d) . Immunoblotting of LC3B-II/I in the presence of 100 nM BafA1 79 indicated that mock-infected compared to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells showed a significant increase of 80 LC3B-II over LC3B-I due to the BafA1-induced inhibition of autophagic flux (Figures 1a-b) . 142 the author/funder.

The putrescine 144 increase might be explained by a SARS-CoV-2-induced inhibition of spermidine synthase, the enzyme 145 that synthesizes spermidine from putrescine (Figure 3c, red) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.997254 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Figure 4a, lower panel, Figure S3d,e) . We further confirmed that the dominant intervention of 178 niclosamide during SARS-CoV-2 infection acts on autophagy induction, as adding BafA1 after 179 niclosamide treatment showed an enhancing effect on the lipidation of LC3B as reflected by 180 comparable LC3B-II/I ratios between mock-and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure 4b) . However, we 181 cannot exclude that the activity of niclosamide as a hydrogen ionophore has additional inhibitory 182 functions, e.g. by blocking endosomal acidification (32), which is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry (6). Twenty-four hours later, cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Vesicles with both green and red fluorescence (APs) and with red fluorescence only (autolysosomes, AL) were counted.
