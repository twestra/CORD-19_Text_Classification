Influenza virus infections cause ~290,000-645,000 deaths (1) and 3-5 million 33 cases of severe illness annually worldwide (2). Viral infection begins in the upper 34 respiratory tract. It can lead to airway inflammation in the lungs and, in severe cases, 35
pneumonia. The molecular mechanisms that underlie disparate outcomes of mild, 36 moderate, and severe illness are currently unknown. 37
Glycosylation within the human host plays a critical role in influenza biology 38 Studies of influenza in model organisms, such as mice, commonly use strains 50 of the virus adapted to the sialic acid receptors prevalent in the upper respiratory 51 tract of these hosts (i.e. α-2,3-linked sialosides), which differ from α-2,6-sialosides 52 found in the human respiratory tract. Ferrets, however, have a similar glycan 53 distribution in their respiratory system to humans, i.e. α-2,6-linked sialic acids and 54 low levels of N-glycolyl sialosides in the upper respiratory tract. This makes them a 55 more representative model for human biology, enabling the use of un-adapted 56 human strains of influenza (5). 57
Here, we ask whether glycosylation might play a role in the outcome of 58 influenza virus infection. We analyzed ferret host response in the lung to the 2009 59 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) influenza virus using our lectin microarray 60 technology (6-8). This H1N1 strain caused an estimated 150,000-580,000 deaths 61 worldwide in the first 12 months of circulation, with wide variation in outcomes among 62 controls. In contrast, ferrets with mild infections displayed a smaller increase in high 123 mannose levels (~12-19%, dependent on lectin). 124
Overall, our lectin microarray data argues that although we see changes in 125 sialic acids with infection, they have no correlation with severity. Rather, high 126 mannose, an epitope not typically associated with influenza pathogenesis, appears 127 to directly correlate with severity. ferrets. In general, we observed a correlation between damage to the lung, as 137 defined by consolidation and inflammatory cell infiltrate, and staining with the high 138 mannose binding lectin HHL (Fig. 2a) . In normal lung, HHL staining was confined to 139 the bronchiole epithelium and basement membrane. In contrast, in infected and 140 consolidated lung tissues we observed binding to compacted alveolar spaces and 141 bronchial plugs. We also observed binding to inflammatory cells and sloughed 142 bronchial epithelium. We observe a strong correlation between HHL staining and the 143 alveolar severity score, which reflects alveolar damage and inflammation caused by 144 the infection (Fig. 2b) . Overall, our data shows that high mannose is associated with 145 both direct damage to the lungs, observed by histology, and overall illness levels, 146 observed by weight loss.

If glycosylation plays a role in inducing the damage leading to severity, we 154 would expect changes to be observed early in influenza pathogenesis. 155
To examine whether glycomic changes in the host occur early or late in 156 influenza pathogenesis, we performed a time-course analysis where infected ferrets 157 were sacrificed at days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 (n=12 for days 1-3, n=8 for day 5, n=19 for 158 day 8, n=8 for day 14, for a total of 59 ferrets). We analyzed 2 lung punch biopsies 159 per ferret. The time course experiments and our previously discussed analysis were 160 performed concurrently and analyzed on the same set of arrays. Thus, data for day 161 8 ferrets and control (day 0) samples are the same as in Figure 1a . High mannose, which correlates to severity at day 8, was strongly induced in 180 some ferrets at day 1 (Fig. 3a) . At this early time point we are unable to predict 181 whether ferrets with higher levels of high mannose have a more severe 182 immunological response to influenza virus infection overall. However, HHL staining 183 of virally infected lungs from ferrets sacrificed at day 1 correlated with damage in the 184 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

suggests that high mannose is induced immediately upon infection with influenza 186 virus and that the levels of the epitope are directly correlated with severity even at 187 the early time points. cells, we treated primary bronchial epithelia with PR8 and analyzed them as 207 described. Again, we observed a strong increase in high mannose in response to 208 viral infection (Fig. 4b) . Infection of A549 cells with other influenza strains 209 (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, influenza B, Fig. 4c) , also resulted in an increase in high 210 mannose, indicating that the response is not strain specific. 211
Given that high mannose is a precursor in the N-glycan pathway, a question 212 that arises is whether high mannose could act as an independent signal without 213 impacting complex N-glycan levels. Recent studies have shown that the trimming 214 mannosidases, MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 can be independently deleted without 215 impacting complex N-glycans (29, 30). In addition, both enzymes are predicted to be 216 highly regulated by miRNA (31), and miRNA downregulating MAN1A2 increased 217 high mannose without decreasing core fucose, a marker of complex N-glycans (11). 218
To test this more directly, we performed lectin microarray analysis of A549 cells 219 infected with PR8 ( Fig. 5a, Supplemental Fig. 10 ). In line with our observation in 220 ferret lungs and our microscopy data, we again observed an increase in high 221 mannose (GRFT, SVN, HHL, UDA). However, we did not observe a corresponding 222 immune response, and viral stability (33). Glycosylation of NA is essential for the 233 enzyme activity (33). M2, a small transmembrane protein of about 11 KD, is at 10-234 100 fold lower abundance than HA on the virus surface and has a putative N-235 glycosylation site at which glycosylation is not commonly observed (33-36). To 236 determine whether the increase in high mannose was due to influenza virus 237 glycoproteins or to changes in glycosylation of host proteins, we performed lectin 238 blot analysis in tandem with Western blot analysis of HA and NA, the major influenza 239 virus glycoproteins (Fig. 5b, Supplemental Fig. 11 ). Upon infection, we detect 240 increased levels of high mannose across multiple proteins, both influenza and host, 241 as determined by HHL binding. We observed a strong increase in high mannose for 242 a band correlating to NA (indicated by arrows, Fig. 5b) . Quantitation of the lectin 243 blot, excluding presumed HA and NA proteins, reveals a 120% increase in HHL 244 binding, indicating a major increase in high mannose on host proteins.

This indicates that UPR is rapidly induced by (Fig. 6b, Supplemental Fig. 12a ). This indicates that induction of the high 267 mannose epitope occurs downstream of the XBP1s arm of the UPR. Lectin 268 microarray analysis revealed 4μ8C inhibited high mannose but did not impact the 269 change in sialylation observed upon infection, arguing that the impact of inhibiting 270 this pathway is specific to the high mannose response (Supplemental Fig. 12b) . To test whether recognition is dependent upon the high mannose epitope, we 301 removed all high mannose and hybrid N-glycans using Endo H. Removal of these 302 glycans abolished the signal, providing evidence that the recognition is via the high 303 mannose epitope (Fig. 7) .

Lectin-glycan interactions play a major role in infectious disease, impacting 310 all stages from colonization to disease progression and host response (50-52) . activating the complement cascade and subsequent inflammation (Fig. 8) . Inhibition 323 of the complement cascade with C3a inhibitors reduces damage in H5N1 influenza 324 virus-infected mice, providing additional evidence for our hypothesis (53). Our results 325
indicate that high mannose can be induced through the UPR upon influenza infection 326 (Fig. 6, Supplemental Fig. 12) . The use of high mannose by the cell, as a type of 327 damage or distress signal, makes sense as it is not detected at the cell surface on 328 most cell types, but is recognized by a significant number of innate immune lectins, 329
including MBL2 (Fig. 7) (12). In addition, high mannose has the potential for 330 independent regulation from the complex N-glycan pool (Fig. 5a) (11, 29-31) . Taken 331 together, our work provides a new mechanism that could explain the observation 332 that both UPR activation and MBL2 levels directly associate with severity of outcome 333 from influenza infection (13, 18, 19) . 334
A picture is emerging in which high mannose could act as a signal to our 335 immune system through MBL2 (and potentially other mannose-binding lectins) to 336 clear damaged and infected cells. This hypothesis, which requires further testing, 337 could be relevant for not only influenza but also other respiratory viruses where the 338 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
