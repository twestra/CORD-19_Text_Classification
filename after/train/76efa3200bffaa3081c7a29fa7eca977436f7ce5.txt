Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent 2 of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the 3 urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging 4
CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, 5 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial 6 cultures (EC50 = 0.01 µM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 µM) due to their 7 low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-8
CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice 9 infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved 10 pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is 11 was not certified by peer review) RNA 15 polymerase, therapeutic, mouse. 16 17 C-adenosine analog GS-441524, potently inhibits replication of a broad spectrum of pre-pandemic bat 30 CoVs and human epidemic CoVs in primary human lung cell cultures (Agostini et al., 2018; Brown et al., 31 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017). Biochemical analysis of the mechanism of inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2, 32 SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed that incorporation of 33 the active metabolite RDV triphosphate (RDV-TP) was more efficient than the natural substrate ATP and 34 led to delayed chain termination three nucleotides downstream of incorporation (Gordon et al., 2020a, 35 2020b). Prolonged passaging of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a group 2a CoV, in the presence of GS-36 441524 resulted in low level resistance through mutations in the RdRp, further implicating this protein as 37 the drug target (Agostini et al., 2018). RDV showed both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mouse 38 models of SARS and MERS and against MERS-CoV challenge in a rhesus macaque model (Sheahan et 39 al., 2017(Sheahan et 39 al., , 2020a Wit et al., 2020). Here we report that RDV potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication 40
Calu3 human lung cells with sub-micromolar EC50 and in primary human airway epithelial cultures 41 (HAEs) with nanomolar EC50. Notably, we have detected comparably lower potency of RDV in 42 established human and monkey cell lines due to their lower metabolic capacity to activate the compound. 43 was not certified by peer review)
While four endemic human CoV (HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1) typically cause mild 23 respiratory diseases with common cold-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 24 cause severe respiratory disease with respective mortality rates of 11% (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003) , 35% 25 (Arabi et al., 2017) , and an estimated 3% (Chen, 2020) . The development of effective broad-spectrum 26 antivirals has been hampered by viral diversity, the capacity of CoVs to adaptively overcome negative 27 selective pressures, and the ability to actively counteract drugs through the action of a proofreading 28 exoribonuclease. We previously reported that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of the 29
Mice infected with chimeric SARS-CoV-1 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and treated therapeutically 44 with RDV show decreased viral loads in the lungs and increased pulmonary function. These data 45 emphasize the potential of RDV as a promising countermeasure against the ongoing COVID-19 46 pandemic. 47 replication for each cell type, and infectious viral titer and viral genome copy number in the supernatant 109 were quantified by plaque assay and RT-qPCR, respectively. RDV and GS-441524 potently inhibited 110 SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types ( Fig. 2; Table 1 ). In Calu3 cells, 111 both compounds displayed dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication as determined by plaque assay 112 ( Fig. 2B) and RT-qPCR (Fig. 2C) . RDV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 = 0.28 μM and EC90 = 2.48 113 μM. The parent compound GS-441524 was less potent: EC50 = 0.62 μM, EC90 = 1.34 μM ( Fig. 2D ; Table  114 1). EC50 values determined by quantification of viral genome copies were roughly two-fold higher than 115 those obtained by quantification of infectious virus ( Fig. 2E; Table 1 ). Both compounds also displayed 116 dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication in Vero E6 cells as determined by infectious viral titer and 117 genome copy number (Fig 2F) . RDV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 = 1.65 μM and EC90 = 2.40 μM, 118 while GS-441524 was more potent (EC50 = 0.47 μM, EC90 = 0.71 μM) ( Fig. 2G; Table 1 ). Relative 119 potency based on genome copies was similar to that assessed by quantification of infectious viral titer in 120 Vero E6 cells ( Fig. 2H; Table 1 ). Thus, RDV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 more potently in Calu3 2B4 than in 121 Vero E6 cells. 122
(HAE) cultures. Primary HAE cultures grown on air-liquid interface recapitulate the cellular complexity 124 and physiology of the human conducting airway (Sims et al., 2005) . Therefore, we evaluated antiviral 125 activity of RDV in this biologically relevant model. In RDV treated HAE, we observed a dose-dependent 126 reduction in infectious virus production, with >100-fold inhibition at the highest tested concentration 127 (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, RDV demonstrate potent antiviral activity with EC50 values of 0.0010 and 0.009 128 µM in two independent experiments (Fig. 3B) . We previously reported that RDV is not cytotoxic at doses 129 at or below 10 µM in this culture system, supporting the conclusion that the observed antiviral effect was 130 virus-specific (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Together, these data demonstrate that RDV is potently antiviral 131 against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human lung cultures with a selectivity index of >1000. in different cell culture models. Both RDV and GS-441524 undergo intracellular conversion to the active 137 metabolite RDV-TP involving several metabolic steps (Fig. S4 ) and the efficiency of each step might 138 differ between cell types. Therefore, to reconcile the differences in antiviral activity of RDV and GS-139 441524 observed in our and other studies, we compared intracellular RDV-TP concentrations in Vero E6, 140
Calu3 2B4, and HAEs following incubation with the two compounds. RDV-TP levels per million cells 141 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

(Fig 4; Table 1; Tables S1, S2). Given the primary nature of HAE cultures,  143   we used cells from two independent donors with similar demographic profiles. RDV-TP was efficiently  144   formed in both donor cultures following incubation with RDV with a difference of < 3-fold from each  145 other. The lowest levels of RDV-TP were observed following RDV treatment of Vero E6 cells and were 146 approximately 4-and 20-fold lower than those observed in Calu3 2B4 and HAE cultures, respectively. 147
The levels of GS-441524 as well as the intermediate mono-and di-phosphorylated metabolites (RDV-MP 148 and RDV-DP) were readily detected in Calu3 2B4 cultures following treatment with RDV, but were 149 below the limit of quantification in Vero E6 cells at all time points tested (Table S1 ). In addition, 150 incubation of Vero E6 cells with GS-441524 yielded 4-fold higher RDV-TP levels compared to 151 incubation with RDV corresponding to higher antiviral potency of GS-441524 relative to RDV, which is 152 not observed with either Calu3 or HAE cultures. (Table S1, S2). In conclusion, the RDV-TP levels in the 153 different cell types directly correlated with the antiviral potencies of RDV and GS-441524 against SARS-154
CoV-2 with the HAE cultures producing substantially higher levels of RDV-TP that translated into 155 markedly more potent antiviral activity of RDV (Table 1) . Importantly, the metabolism of RDV in Vero 156 E6 cells appeared altered and was less efficient particularly in comparison with the HAE cultures, 157
indicating that Vero E6 cells might not be an adequate cell type to characterize the antiviral activity of 158 RDV and potentially also other nucleotide prodrug-based antivirals. 159
To determine whether RDV exerts antiviral 160 effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, we constructed a chimeric mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-1 variant encoding 161 the target of RDV antiviral activity, the RdRp, of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS1/SARS2-RdRp) (Fig. 5A) . 162
Although other chimeric replicase ORF recombinant CoVs have shown to be viable (Stobart et al., 2013) , 163 this is the first demonstration that the RdRp from a related but different CoV can support efficient 164 replication of another. After recovery and sequence-confirmation ( Fig. 5B ) of recombinant chimeric 165 viruses with and without nanoluciferase reporter, we compared SARS-CoV-1 and SARS1/SARS2-RdRp 166 replication and sensitivity to RDV in Huh7 cells. Replication of both viruses was inhibited similarly in a 167 dose-dependent manner by RDV (SARS-CoV-1 mean EC50 = 0.007 µM; SARS1/SARS2-RdRp mean 168 EC50 = 0.003 µM) ( Fig. 5C and D) . We then sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy of RDV against 169 the SARS1/SARS2-RdRp in mouse models employed for previous studies of RDV (Sheahan et al., 2017) . 170
Mice produce a serum esterase absent in humans, carboxyl esterase 1c (Ces1c), that dramatically reduces 171 half-life of RDV. Thus, to mirror pharmacokinetics observed in humans, mouse studies with RDV must 172 be performed in transgenic C57Bl/6 Ces1c -/mice (Sheahan et al., 2017) . We infected female C57Bl/6 173 Ces1c -/mice with 10 3 PFU SARS1/SARS2-RdRp and initiated subcutaneous treatment with 25 mg/kg 174 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This regimen was continued until study termination. While 175 weight loss did not differ between vehicle-and RDV-treated animals (Fig. 5E) , lung hemorrhage at five 176 dpi was significantly reduced with RDV treatment (Fig. 5F ). To gain insight into physiologic metrics of 177 disease severity, we measured pulmonary function daily by whole body plethysmography (WBP). The 178 WBP metric, PenH, is a surrogate marker of pulmonary obstruction (Menachery et al., 2015a) . 179
Therapeutic RDV significantly ameliorated loss of pulmonary function observed in the vehicle-treated 180 group (Fig. 5G) . Importantly, RDV treatment dramatically reduced lung viral load (Fig. 5H) .

Therefore, the 214 differences in EC50 may be partially explained by intrinsic differences of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates, 215 quantification methods, and assay conditions such as incubation period and virus input. metabolite, suggesting an altered uptake and/or intracellular metabolism of RDV, consistent with a 226 previous report describing inefficient metabolism of the nucleotide prodrug sofosbuvir in Vero cells 227 (Mumtaz et al., 2017) . Drug potency in Vero E6 was similar whether quantified by infectious virus or 228 genome copy number. In Calu3 cells, the potency determined by RT-qPCR was about two-fold lower 229 than when quantified by plaque assay. It is possible that RT-qPCR, which was developed to detect 230 nucleocapsid (N) RNA, also detects packaged subgenomic RNAs and defective genomes in addition to 231 full-length genomes. This would result in underestimation of the reduction in infectious titer. Notably, the 232 potency of RDV against SARS-CoV-1 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in Huh7 cells was more than 233 100-fold higher than that of RDV against bona-fide SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 and Calu3 cells. This 234 difference could be due to infectivity, which is driven by the SARS-CoV-1 instead of the SARS-CoV-2 235 spike protein. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 infects Huh7 cells at low frequency at the MOI used in this study 236 and does not appear to spread throughout the culture over the course of the experiment. The number of 237
Huh7 cells in which virus replicates is relatively lower compared to Calu3 cells, possibly enhancing 238 potency of RDV in Huh7 compared to Calu3.
