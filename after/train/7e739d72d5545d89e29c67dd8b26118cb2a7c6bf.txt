hike in number of positive cases including number of healthcare professionals (HCPs) also acquired infection. Knowledge, attitude, and practice survey provides a suitable format to evaluate existing programs and to identify effective strategies for behavior change in society. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. An online survey-based study was conducted among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105%) nurses. Most commonly utilized information source was social media. Findings showed HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (8.43±1.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that overcrowding in emergency room (52.9%, n=219), limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) of COVID-19 are the major barriers in infection control practice. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HCPs of age group 40-49 years (OR: 1.419, 95%CI: (0.14-4.78, P=0.041) have higher odds of good knowledge. Similarly, age group of 31-39 years (OR: 1.377, 95% CI: 0.14-2.04, P=0.05), experience of more than 5 years (OR: 10.71, 95% CI: 2.83-40.75, P<0.001), and pharmacist job (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) were the substantial determinants of good practice regarding COVID-19. HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there are areas where gaps in knowledge and practice was observed. To effectively control infection spread, well-structured .

In earlier December, first case of pneumonia of unknown cause originated in Wuhan, capital city of Province Hubei, China, and on 31 December 2019, with emergence of more such cases, Wuhan gained attention by World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . The pathogen identified was named as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), currently called as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped and single stranded RNA virus [2] which has phylogenetic resemblance to SARS-COV-1 [3] . Owing to rapid spread of this deadly virus from epicenter to number of countries, WHO declared it as public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. Later, due to uncased fast spread, severity of illness, the continual escalation in number of affected countries, cases and causalities, WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 [4] . To date (12 April, 2020), the COVID-19 have spread to 210 countries and territories accounted for 1,790,550 laboratory confirmed cases and 109,654 mortalities also attributed to this deadly pathogen [5] .
Pakistan, a country with most vulnerable geographical location for this pandemic as it sandwiches between China; a country of origin and also a first epicenter of COVID-19 and Iran; an epicenter of Islamic world with 4,357 deaths and 70,029 cases attributed to COVID-19 [5] . Pakistan's first COVID-19 case was reported on 26 February 2020, has travelled from Iran [6] . By 12 April 2020, Pakistan has 5,038 laboratory confirmed cases and 86 COVID-19 associated deaths. Punjab (n=2425) has highest number of cases followed by Sindh (n=1318), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) (n=696), Baluchistan (n=228), Gilgit Baltistan (216), Islamabad (n=119), and Azad Jammu Kashmir (n=35) [7] .
COVID-19 transmits from person to person by droplets when an infected person sneezes and by direct contact and virus has an incubation period of 4-14 days [8] . Elderly and patients who suffered with chronic medical conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are more likely to get severe infection [8] . The main manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, hypolymphaemia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia [1, 9] . Presently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is explicitly recommended for COVID-19 and implementation of preventive measures to control COVID-19 is the mainstay critical intervention [10] . Amidst to current pandemic, WHO has issued several guidelines and also started online courses and training sessions to raise awareness and preparedness regarding prevention and control of .

In addition, study will highlight the information sources utilized and barriers in infection control perceived by HCPs.
A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted during the month of March 2020, days of strict lockdown to implement social distancing to avoid spread of pandemic. As it was not feasible to conduct population-based survey in this critical condition, the investigators selected an online data collection method.
Sample size calculated by Raosoft was 377 assuming a response rate of 50%, confidence interval (CI) 95%, Z as 1.96, and margin of error d as 5%. Considering, an additional 10% (n=37) for any error in questionnaire filling, a final sample size of 414 will be required. Survey was started on .

The study population eligible for participation in this survey were HCPs including doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. Pakistani nationals of age 16 years or more and consented for filling the data form are invited to participate.
A questionnaire was designed on google forms and link generated was shared on WhatsApp grou2ps of HCPs. Link was also shared personally to HCPs who were in contact list of investigators. Respondents from other provinces were also eligible to participate if they are willing to fill the questionnaire.
A survey instrument was designed based on extensive literature review, course material regarding emerging respiratory diseases including COVID-19 by WHO [18] , and guidelines issued by NIH, Islamabad Pakistan [19] . After an initial draft of the questionnaire designed, it was validated in 2 steps. Firstly, the study instrument was sent to researchers and professionals from pharmacy and medical background to give their expert opinion with respect to its simplicity, relativity and importance. Secondly, a pilot study was conducted by selecting a small sample of health care professionals (n = 40) who gave their opinions on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter.
Participants from all healthcare professions were selected for the pilot study. Amendments from the participants were considered and integrated into the questionnaire, while ensuring its consistency with the published literature. After a thorough discussion, questionnaire was finalized by the authors and subsequently distributed to the participants for their response. Reliability .

The study was performed in accordance to declaration of Helsinki. Due to lockdown, universities were closed, hence study protocol was approved from Hospital board (756/THQ/HR). Study questionnaire contained consent portion that stated purpose, nature of survey, study objectives, volunteer participation, declaration of confidentiality and anonymity.
Data was entered in Microsoft Excel and later imported in SPSS V.21 for statistical analysis.
Numerical variables were measured as mean and standard deviations while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Inferential statistics were applied depending upon nature of data and variables. Chi-square tests were applied to find difference in knowledge groups (good vs poor) and practice (good vs poor) by demographic characteristics. Independent sample ttest and one-way ANOVA analysis were performed in assessing any difference in mean attitude score by demographic characteristics. Pearson-rank correlation tests were applied to find any correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice sections. To find possible determinants of good knowledge and practice, a binary logistic regression analysis will be applied and expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered as significant in all tests.
A total of 414 respondents were included in final analysis, of which 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105) nurses. There was equal proportion of male (50.5%, n=209) and female (49.5%, n=205) respondents, majority (74.9%, n=310) of respondents were of age less than 30 years, and 31.6% (n=131) have experience of 1-3 years ( Table I) .

Majority of professionals reported social media (87.68%, n=363) as main source of information followed by radio & television (45.89%, n=190) and seniors/other colleagues (42.51%, n=176) ( Fig.1 ). 
Fig. 3 represents the responses obtained for attitude items. All the HCPs responded to all 7 items on their attitude regarding COVID-19. Findings demonstrated highly positive attitude of HCPs towards COVID-19. About 97.80% (n=405) individuals strongly agreed that gowns, gloves must be used when dealing with infected patients and equal proportion of respondents strongly believed that diseased patients should be kept isolated. More than 80% participants strongly agreed that transmission of COVID-19 could be prevented by following universal precautions given by WHO, CDC and that healthcare workers must acknowledge themselves with all the information regarding .

Similarly, 76.80% (n=318) HCPs had positive attitude regarding "intensive and emergency treatment should be given to diagnosed patients", and 70% participants strongly agreed that "any related information should be disseminated among healthcare workers". On the other hand, 69.10% (n=286) HCPs strongly agreed that prevalence of infection could be controlled by actively involving in infection control programs (Fig.3 ). 
Majority of respondents (93.2%, n=386) had good knowledge regarding COVID-19. Chi-square tests were applied to find difference in knowledge status by demographic characteristics of HCPs .

Findings demonstrated that age was significantly associated with good knowledge as 95.5% (n=284) HCPs of age less than 30 years had good knowledge compared to healthcare professions of other age groups. The overall knowledge score indicated good knowledge among physicians (93.3%, n=112), pharmacists (94.7%, n=179), and nurses (90.5%, n=95) but the difference was statistically insignificant (P=0.383). Similarly, knowledge score was not statistically differed by gender (P=0.403), and experience (P=0.281) ( Table II) .
Independent sample t-test revealed that attitude score was not statistically (P=0.788) differed by gender (8.41 vs 8.45). One-way ANOVA analysis indicated that physician (8.41) have highest positive attitude followed by pharmacists (8.43) and nurses (8.64) but association was not significant (P=0.358). Similarly, no difference in mean attitude score was found by age and experience (P>0.05). (Table II) Of 414 participants, 88.7% (n=367) had positive practice (score=5-6) in following precautions to avoid COVID-19. Chi-square analysis revealed that majority (95.7%, n=112) of HCPs having greater experience (more than 5 years) had good practice of following precautions compared to less experienced counterparts (P=0.020). Findings also showed that physician (94.3%, n=114) had highest practice than nurses (91.4%, n=96), and pharmacists (90.5%, n=171), but the difference was not significant (0.091). (Table II) .
Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age group of 40-49 years (OR: 1.419, 95%CI: 0.14-4.78, P=0.041) and age group of 50 years or more were the significant factors associated with good knowledge.

Pearson correlation tests revealed a statistically significant positive linear correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice scores as follows: knowledge-attitude (r = 0.106, p value = .030), knowledge-practice (r = 0.142, p value = .016), and attitude-practice (r = 0.174, p value = .004) ( Table IV) .
To best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has thoroughly assessed the knowledge, attitude and practice of HCPs toward COVID-19 in Pakistan. The study also highlighted possible barriers perceived by HCPs in infection control practices.
For HCPs, good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices of following precautionary measures such as wearing gloves, protective clothing, goggles and face mask is imperative in effective dealing with infected patients with minimum risks. Also, ongoing pandemic nature of disease made it necessary for HCPs to multiply their alarms corresponding to critical situation and to put efforts in following and implementing related hygienic conditions as well as This is important as in this global pandemic, there is also a pandemic of misinformation regarding COVID-19; a serious concern might lead to xenophobia in the world as already warned by Of note that, more than 20% health care professionals had inaccurate knowledge that influenza vaccine provide protection against COVID-19 and also were not aware of that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to get infections. Despite of a prioritized global health emergency and availability of easily accessible sources provided by both national (National .

This proportion (20%) is higher than other study that stated only 9.1% respondents have answered that flu vaccine could provide protection against COVID-19 [10]. Possible speculation is that currently the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan is recent and discussion happens among HCPs is more likely regarding the symptoms of disease compared to other aspects like risky population and usefulness of existed vaccines and treatments. It is therefore necessary that these aspects of COVID-19 should be uncovered and cleared to HCPs so that they can educate people to counter this global public health issue. Correlational analysis also augments the findings of present study as knowledge is significantly related to attitude and also reflected by good practices. This view also inferred that HCPs with positive attitude are more interested in seeking knowledge and then put knowledge into practice.
This correlation could also be explained by Reasoned action theory. This theory states that a person's intention to a specific behaviour is a function of their attitude towards that behaviour [31] .
Future studies should be conducted to understand possible factors that underlies knowledge pattern and attitudes expressed by HCPs.
Current study highlighted the less explored area where scarce literature was available. Study identify the current status of HCPs knowledge; an important aspect in successful response to any epidemic. Questionnaire was developed by using WHO published material and a two-step validation approach also increases the reliability of current analysis.
The study has number of implicit limitations. Firstly, it is a cross-sectional study conducted during lockdown period, and universities were also closed, therefore institutional review board was not approached. Secondly, this is an online survey, responses mainly depend upon honesty and partly affected by recall ability and thus may subject to recall bias. Potential sample clustering might also limit the generalizability of study.

The study also able to highlight gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. Findings also demonstrated that HCPs were using less authentic sources, this aspect should immediately be addressed as it ultimately affects knowledge and reflected in attitude and practice. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19 with a comprehensive training program consisting better structured targeting all HCPs including physicians, pharmacists and nurses, in order to have equilibrium clinical knowledge about COVID-19.
