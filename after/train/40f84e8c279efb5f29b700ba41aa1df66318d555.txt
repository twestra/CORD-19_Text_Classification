Online queries were compared with the number of new COVID-19 cases and tests. Time series 26 trends and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients showed that the number of COVID-19-27 related queries in South Korea increased during the local and international events; higher in 28 women, certain age groups; and higher in affected areas, which represented the community 29 health risk perception. Greater correlations were found in mobile searches compared to that of 30 desktop searches, indicating the changing behavior in searching health online information. The 31 use of both Google and NAVER RSV to explore the patterns of community health risk 32 perception could be beneficial for targeting risk communication in several perspectives including 33 time, population characteristics, and location. 34

However, 127 patterns of coronavirus test-related searches seemed more similar to trends of new COVID-19 128 cases compared with the daily numbers of tests. 129 Similar patterns to the online queries on coronavirus test were also identified for 130 facemasks (마스크). In the role of personal protective measures, facemask-related queries were 131 elevated in the same period when people started to search for coronavirus tests and facemask 132 shortage in early February (15), and gradually declined in late of February as the regular supply 133 of facemask has been provided government (16) . Besides, the massive increase of locally 134 acquired cases also induced huge internet searches related to social distancing (사회적 135 거리두기) as one of the preventive approaches. Those searches reached their peaks as a 136 widespread campaign for social distancing in the first week of March 2020 in South Korea (5). 137
