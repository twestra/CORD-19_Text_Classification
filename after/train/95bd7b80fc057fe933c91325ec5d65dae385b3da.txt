The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to estimate the characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Austria and Moldova. The final sizes and durations of epidemic outbreaks in these countries are calculated.

To determine the initial conditions for the set of equations (1-3), let us suppose that at the moment of the epidemic outbreak 0 t , [5, 6] :
The analytical solution for the set of equations (1-3) was obtained by introducing the function
, corresponding to the number of victims or cumulative confirmed number of cases, [5, 6] :
Thus, for every set of parameters N,  , , 0 t and a fixed value of V the integral (6) can be calculated and the corresponding moment of time can be determined from (5) .
and R(t) can be easily calculated with the of formulas, [5, 6] .
Function I has a maximum at S   and tends to zero at infinity, see [2, 3] . In comparison, the number of susceptible persons at infinity 0 S   , and can be calculated from the non-linear equation, [5, 6] :
The final number of victims (final accumulated number of cases) can be calculated from:

which means that at final t t  less than one person still spread the infection.
In the case of a new epidemic, the values of this independent four parameters are unknown and must be identified with the use of limited data sets. A statistical approach was developed in [5] and used in [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] to estimate the values of unknown parameters. The registered points for the number of victims V j corresponding to the moments of time t j can be used in order to calculate
for every fixed values N and  with the use of (6) and then to check how the registered points fit the straight line (5) . For this purpose the linear regression can be used, e.g., [13] , and the optimal straight line, minimizing the sum of squared distances between registered and theoretical points, can be defined. Thus we can find the optimal values of  , 0 t and calculate the correlation coefficient r .
Then the F-test may be applied to check how the null hypothesis that says that the proposed linear relationship (5) fits the data set. The experimental value of the Fisher function can be calculated with the use of the formula:
where n is the number of observations, m=2 is the number of parameters in the regression equation, [13] . The corresponding experimental value F has to be compared with the critical value 
Usually the number of cases during the initial period of an epidemic outbreak is not reliable.

It can be seen that the previous predictions for Italy and Austria [11] were more optimistic.
Fresh data sets has showed that the final number of cases in Italy could reach 226,000 and their appearance can stop only after August 18, 2020 (see Table 5 , prediction 6). The epidemic stop in Austria is expected after May 21, 2020 (see Table 4 ). These estimations are valid only when the quarantine measures, isolation rate and the coronavisus activity will be same as for the periods taken for calculations.

Table 5 and Fig. 3 show that the epidemic outbreak in France could happen around January 25, 2020. This estimation correlates with the results of paper [17] , where the first COVID-19 cases with 5 Chinese tourists are described. They were from Wuhan and arrived in Europe on January 17-22, 2020.

Figs. 1-6 illustrate that close to the epidemic outbreaks, the information about number of cases is not complete, since it is difficult to detect all the infected persons, especially those with mild illness.

The data quality may be very different and unpredictable. The only way to obtain the reliable results is to compare the V(t) curve with V j data obtained after day of calculations. If the discrepancy after some days of observation is too large, new calculations must be performed with the use of fresh data. "Stars" in Figs. 1-3, 5,6 illustrate that the accuracy of calculations is good enough. Probably, the prediction for Spain is too optimistic and can be updated later.
Numbers of infected I (green), removed R (black) and the number of victims V=I+R (blue line). It looks, that SIR model can determine the real time of epidemic outbreak. Due to the data incompleteness, the "hidden" period could be very long. For example, the real epidemic outbreaks All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

There is no reason to think that the "hidden" period in China was shorter.
According to [18] , the first laboratory confirmed case was recorded on December 8, 2019. Therefore the real "zero" patient could get infection in October-November, 2019 and probably had no connection with the Wuhan fish market. Chinese authorities notified WHO about the epidemic outbreak only on January 3, 2020 (see [18] ). This delay and obstacles to the dissemination of truthful information (an example is doctor Li Wenliang ) has led to tragic consequences in Europe and other parts of the world. SIR curves could be useful to estimate the number of persons who are still spreading the infection, so known "hidden" patients (see green lines in Figs. 1-6) . These information could be useful to plan the relaxation of quarantine measures. If medical and other services are able to quickly isolate persons who have contacted, for example, with 100 "hidden" patients, then there is no need to wait until the number of patients on the green curve reaches the value of unity. On the other hand, such attenuations may extend the time of occurrence of new cases and the number of deaths. A compromise between medicine and economic interests must be found here.
The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model and statistical approach to the parameter are able to make some reliable estimations for the epidemic dynamics, e.g., the real time of the outbreak, final size and duration of the epidemic and the number of persons spreading the infection versus time. This information may be useful to regulate the quarantine activities and to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic. Unfortunately, the number of patients in Europe already exceeds one million. The risk of catching the infection will persist until at least mid-August, 2020. Such fatal consequences could have been avoided if timely and truthful information came from China.
