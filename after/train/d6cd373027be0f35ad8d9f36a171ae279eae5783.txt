17 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an urgent global public health emergency and 18 warrants investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral 19 proteins involved in host cell adhesion. The recent comparative genomic studies highlight 20 the insertion of Furin protease site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein alerting possible 21 modification in the viral spike protein and its eventual entry to host cell and presence of Furin 22 site implicated to virulence. Here we structurally show how Furin interacts with the SARS-23
CoV-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer at S1/S2 region, which underlined the mechanism and 24 mode of action, which is a key for host cell entry. Unravelling the structural features of 25 biding site opens the arena in rising bonafide antibodies targeting to block the Furin cleavage 26 and have great implications in the development of Furin inhibitors or therapeutics. 27 28
The pandemic Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute 30
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an urgent public health emergency 31 and made a serious impact on global health and economy (1). To date, more than 86,000 32 deaths and 1.5 million confirmed positive cases were reported globally, making the most 33 contagious pandemic in the last decade (www.coronavirus.gov).

Most available neutralising antibodies in use are targeting the SARS-37
CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is essential for host cell adhesion via ACE2 and CD26 38 receptors (3, 4), but infection control is still insignificant. Meanwhile, several antiviral drugs 39 (Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Chloroquine, Remdesivir and others) targeting different host and viral 40 proteins are been clinically evaluating and repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection (2, 41 5). With the drastic increasing number of the positive cases around the world (www.cdc.gov), 42 moderate response to antivirals under clinical trials and poor response to antibodies targeting 43 spike SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a serious concern and warrants detail understanding 44 of the molecular and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in native 45 condition and post-viral infection. This will abet in understanding the dynamics and 46 mechanism of viral action on the human cell.

Unfortunately, the only two available SARS-CoV-2 72 spike glycoprotein Cryo-EM structures (PDB: 6VSB and 6VXX) are incomplete and has 73 several gaps in the built structure and also lacks the structure for Furin cleavage sites (3, 12). 74
As these EM structures built on molecular replacement with SARS-CoV-1 (PDB: 6ACG), 75
Furin cleavage sites in the spike protein is flexible and novel insertion only in the SARS-76
CoV-2, the EM structures lack this important region. Hence, for the molecular dynamics and 77 simulation studies, we directed to use previously published and validated model structure of 78 full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (4) and published structure of human Furin 79 (PDB: 1P8J or 1JXH) (11). The RMSD of the previously published model structure and 80
Cryo-EM structure was 0.84, which suggests overall structural accuracy even with the 81 presence of Furin cleavage sites. The binding free energies were taken into consideration for 82 selecting the best possible model. Further validation and refinement was completed by 83 ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrc-84 imb.cam.uk/). The final complex structure was then compared with the initial Furin structure 85 and their overall RMSD was found to be 0.28 Ã… for Ca atoms. 86 87
The overall complex structure shows three Furin proteases binding to the mid or 89 equatorial region (mid region of S1 and S2 domain (S1/S2)) of SARS-CoV-2 spike 90 glycoprotein homo-trimer at the off-centric and adjacent side of spike trimer ( Fig. 1 R298, W328 and Q346 (10, 11) ( Fig. 2 and S2) . Interestingly, these residues are also well-100 positioned to interact with the viral spike protein cleavage site in our complex structure and 101 the entire substrate-binding pocket of Furin protease appears like a canyon-like crevice, 102 .

The results show that the 103 SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein amino acid residues N657 to Q690 are the prime interacting 104 residues with the Furin protease. The position and orientation of these unique residues 105 involved in Furin recognition are well exposed and organise in a flexible loop. The spike 106 protein residues N657, N658, E661, Y660, T678, N679, S680, R682, R683, R685, S689, 107 Q690 makes the strong interaction with the Furin protease ( Fig. 2A) spike glycoproteins also could make the ACE2 and CD26 inhibitors of least effective, as 129 upon cleavage the N-terminal S1 domains are not required for the cell penetration. This also 130 raises a caution that while making neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike 131 glycoprotein, these cleavage activities need to be considered. Hence, we speculate that 132 antibodies against S2 domain and drugs targeting S1 trimerization could be more promising.
