Conclusion: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available 49 capacity of the health system after lockout, transmission should not exceed R=1.5. This 50 .

December 2019. Although it causes an asymptomatic or mild infection in most instances, it 55 can cause severe respiratory illness or even death. Transmission is mainly via droplets 56 released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Aerosol and fomite 57 transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also possible (1) (2). There is no vaccine at present, nor is 58 there any antiviral agent of proven efficacy. Thus traditional measures that control the spread 59 of infectious diseases such as quarantine, contact tracing, isolation of positives and contacts 60 as well as social distancing and hand-washing are of vital importance. 61
The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, 63
representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a 64 completely susceptible population. For COVID-19, R 0 has been estimated by the WHO to be 65 1.4 -2.5. Others have placed it higher, at a median of 2.79 with an interquartile (IQR) range 66 of 1.16 (3). For comparison, seasonal flu has a reported median R 0 of 1.28 (IQR, 1.19-1.37), 67 while measles has an R 0 of 12-18 (4). 68
The 1 st case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Sri Lanka on 27 January 2020, in a tourist from 70
China. The 2 nd case was detected nearly 6 weeks later, on 11 March, in a tour guide who 71
probably contracted the infection from Italian tourists. Since then, the spread of infection has 72 been relatively slow, and mostly confined to returnees from countries with high transmission, 73 and their contacts. However, it must be noted that in four of the 190 cases diagnosed in the 74 30 days from 11 March to 10 April 2020, it was not possible to identify the source of 75 infection. It took nearly a week for the caseload to double from 50 (on 19 March) to 100 on 76 .

It had not yet doubled again as of 11th April, when the count was 197 cases, with 77 54 recovered and 7 deaths (5). The epidemic has not yet reached the stage of full-blown 78 community transmission, and almost all cases still occur in clusters where the chain of 79 transmission can be traced. 80
The government of Sri Lanka acted swiftly to contain transmission, with very stringent public 82 health measures and social distancing: complete island-wide lockdown, contact tracing and 83 isolation, and quarantine of all inbound passengers were all adopted almost simultaneously. 84
The airport has been closed for inbound passengers since 19 March. The national policy with 85 regard to testing was that all symptomatic individuals clinically suspected of infection with 86 SARS-CoV-2, should be tested in one of seven designated laboratories, using PCR as a 87 diagnostic tool. All positive individuals (regardless of severity of illness) are managed in one 88 of three state hospitals, designated for management of COVID-19. These hospitals are also 89 equipped with intensive care units and ventilators for management of the critically ill. 90
However, the control measures have exacted a very heavy social and economic cost, and the 91 state is now about to implement a phased relaxation of preventive measures. For economic 92 and social reasons, the government will be forced to re-open Sri Lanka's borders in the near 93 future, while the pandemic is still going on elsewhere. 94
It has been suggested that most people infected with SAR-CoV-2 show no symptoms but are 96 still able to infect others. Blanket testing of an isolated village of about 3000 individuals in 97 northern Italy found that 50 -75% of infected individuals were asymptomatic (6). Analysis 98 of the outbreak in China found that 81% of symptomatic individuals had mild illness, 99 whereas 14% developed severe illness (i.e., dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30/min, blood 100 .

It is 103 the provision of effective care for this last group of patients, who may require ventilation for 104 2 -3 weeks, that is the crucial limiting factor in any health system. 105
The global numbers as of 10 April were 1,617,204 cases, 364,686 recovered, and 97,039 107 deaths, which suggests a case fatality rate of 5.5% (8). Of the first 140 patients treated for 108 COVID-19 at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Sri Lanka, where the majority of patients 109 have been managed, nine (6.4%) have required intensive care; a similar proportion to that 110 reported from Wuhan. Sri Lanka's case fatality rate has been 3.7% (7/197) as of 11 April 111 2020. 112
If the spread of infection is not controlled, the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 is such that it sweeps 114 swiftly through the susceptible population, resulting in a large number of very ill persons 115 within a short period of time, thus overloading the health system and causing it to collapse. 116 However, it is clearly possible to slow down transmission, as has been demonstrated in Sri 117
Lanka. The availability of beds and ventilators in hospital intensive care units (ICU), to care 118 for critically ill patients, is the major constraining factor that has been observed in all 119 countries with large epidemics. Sri Lanka will need to closely monitor and control the rate of 120 spread of infection so that the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators remains within the 121 available capacity. 122 123 .

We calculated the scenarios that emerge at different values of R, in terms of active infections 158 and ICU requirements subsequent to lockout on 20 April 2020, under the following 159 assumptions: 160 .

The three-day moving average of daily new cases over the first month (Figure 1) is 176 suggestive of two waves of transmission, and so we calculated R separately for these two 177 periods.
