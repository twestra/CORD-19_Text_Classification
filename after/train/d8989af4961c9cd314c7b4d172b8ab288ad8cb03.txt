Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across 22 37
of 0.003∼0.3 µg/mL in pseudotyped particle neutralization assay, and 0.23∼0.50 30 µg/mL in authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Competitive ligand-binding data 31 suggested that the sdAbs either completely blocked or significantly inhibited the 32 association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Finally, we 33 showed that fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improved their neutralization 34 activity by tens of times. These results reveal the novel SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting 35 sdAbs and pave a road for antibody drug development. 36
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of emerging severe 45 acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and had been 46 declared by World Health Organization as the first coronavirus pandemic in human 47 history 1 . The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from asymptomatic or mild to 48 severe with an estimated mortality rate from less than 2% to up to 10% of patients 49 depending on various factors 2 . SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly and sustainably 50 around the world, urging prompt global actions to develop vaccines and antiviral 51 therapeutics. 52 SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein shares ~86.15% identity with SARS-CoV (Genbank ID: 53
Coronaviridae 3 . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA 55 virus with a large genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides in length. The 56 virus-encoded membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins constitute the 57 majority of the protein that is incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 envelope lipid bilayer. 58
The S protein can form homotrimers and protrudes from envelope to show the coronal 59 appearance, invading susceptible cells by binding potential SARS-CoV-2 entry 60 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3 . Recently, researchers have 61 figured out the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein 4 . It is composed of 1273 62 amino acids and structurally belongs to the type I membrane fusion protein with two 63 areas S1 and S2. The S1 region mainly includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), 64 while the S2 region is necessary for membrane fusion. The RBD structure determines 65 its binding efficiency with ACE2 and provides an important target for neutralizing 66 antibody recognition. 67
Single domain antibodies (sdAbs), namely nanobodies, were initially identified from 68 camelids or cartilaginous fish heavy-chain only antibodies devoid of light chains, 69
where antigen-binding is mediated exclusively by a single variable domain (VHH) 5 . 70 Therefore, sdAbs are the smallest fragments that retain the full antigen-binding 71 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The advantages of short development time, flexible formatting 73 and robust production efficiency make sdAb a powerful means to defeat infectious 74 disease pandemics. For therapeutic purpose, relatively sophisticated humanization 75 techniques have been adopted to modify the camelid-specific amino acid sequences 76 in the framework to their human heavy chain variable domain equivalent, without 77 altering sdAb's biological and physical properties and reducing species heterogeneity 7 . 78
As SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging human virus, the whole population is susceptible due 79 to the lack of protective antibodies. The existing neutralizing antibodies in 80 convalescent plasma have been adopted as powerful therapeutic alternatives for 81 COVID-19 patients in China. Using a synthetic humanized sdAbs discovery platform, 82
we were able to obtain several high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting sdAbs with 83 desired neutralization activities. 84 85 Results 86 SARS-CoV-2 makes use its envelope S glycoprotein to gain entry into host cells 87 through binding ACE2. Recent cryo-EM research revealed that the S protein shows 88 an asymmetrical homotrimer with a single RBD in the "up" confirmation and the other 89 two "down" 4 . Antibodies may take advantage of this RBD structure to block virus entry. 90
To enrich for SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding sdAbs, we performed four rounds of 91 biopanning using a lab owned, full synthetic, humanized phage display library with 92 recombinant RBD protein. After phage ELISA identification of 480 clones, a number of 93 sdAbs exhibited an excellent affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Five distinctive sdAd 94 sequences (1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 and 5F8) were cloned into a prokaryotic expression 95 vector and recombinant sdAb proteins were purified by nickel-charged sepharose 96 affinity chromatography (Fig. 1a) . Humanized sdAbs obtained in this study are about 97 125 amino acids with a single VHH domain in average molecular weight less than 98 15KDa (Fig. 1a) . The sdAbs consist of three complementarity determining regions 99 (CDRs) as well as four framework regions (FRs). The amino acids in the frameworks 100 author/funder. All rights reserved.

To determine the kinetic 104 rate and affinity constants, detailed analysis of S antigen-binding to purified sdAb 105 proteins was carried out by SPR. The SARS-CoV-2 or SARC-CoV S protein was 106 immobilized on the surface of Biacore Chip CM5, respectively. Then, various 107 concentrations of purified sdAbs were prepared and injected to pass over the surface. 108
The sensorgram data were fitted to a 1:1 steady-state binding model. SPR results 109 demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the SARS-CoV-2 S 110 protein against sdAbs 1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 and 5F8 were 21.1 nM, 0.846 nM, 3.154 111 nM, 33.97 nM and 0.676 nM respectively ( Fig. 1b-1f & 1h) . However, the sdAbs 112 showed no binding with SARS-CoV S protein, except for the clone 5F8 demonstrating 113 a relatively low affinity with KD = 239.2 nM (Fig. 1g & 1h) . Overall, as monovalent 114 antibody fragment, the sdAbs identified in this study reveals a satisfactory binding 115 performance in a SARS-CoV-2 specific manner. 116
To further evaluate the neutralization activity of these sdAbs, SARS-CoV-2 117 S-pseudotyped particle (SARS-CoV-2pp) infectivity assay was first established. 118
Pseudotyped particles are chimeric virions that consist of a surrogate viral core with a 119 heterologous viral envelope protein at their surface, which can be operated in 120
Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) and frequently used tool for studying virus entry mechanism 121 and neutralizing antibodies 8 . We observed that all five sdAbs showed inhibition 122 potency of SARS-CoV-2pp infection with IC 50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) 123 ranging from 0.003 to 0.3 µg/mL (Fig. 2a) . We next tested the neutralization activity of 124 the sdAbs with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 2b) . Similarly, these sdAbs showed 125 comparable neutralization efficiency, with IC 50 at approximately 0.2-0.6 µg/mL. Totally, 126 these monovalent sdAbs demonstrated encouraging neutralization activity against 127 both pseudotyped and authentic virus, although the neutralization potency is not 128 author/funder.

East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) neutralizing antibodies and 130 may be likely explained by the difference in sdAb recognized RBD spatial epitope or 131 the steric hindrance formed by antigen-antibody complex 9,10 . 132
Within SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the receptor binding motif (RBM) directly contacts ACE2. 133
Recent report demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as its receptor with a 134 much stronger affinity (10-to 20-fold higher) than SARS-CoV 4 . To determine whether 135 sdAbs targeted different antigenic regions on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD surface, we 136 performed a competition-binding assay using a real-time biosensor (Fig. 3) . We tested 137 all five sdAbs in a competition-binding assay in which human ACE2 was attached to a 138 CM5 biosensor. Compared with a non-related isotype control sdAb (Fig. 3a) , addition 139 of 1E2, 3F11 and 4D8 completely prevent binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 (Fig.  140 3b, 3d, 3e). Whereas, sdAbs 2F2 and 5F8 could partially compete the RBD/receptor 141 association ( Fig. 3c & 3f) . These data suggested that these sdAbs can be divided into 142 RBM targeting or non-RBM targeting groups though it is not directly associated with 143 virus neutralization activity. 144
SdAbs can be readily fused to human Fc-domain to overcome the limitations of the 145 monovalent sdAbs, such as the short blood residential time and lacking 146 antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement dependent 147 cytotoxicity 11 . In addition, bivalent sdAbs can be obtained via the disulfide bond 148 formation in Fc hinge area, which was reported to significantly increase sdAb's 149 activity 12 . To further explore the possibility of sdAb-based antiviral therapeutics and 150 enhance neutralization activity, we constructed human heavy chain antibodies by 151 fusing the human IgG1 Fc region to the C-terminus of sdAbs ( Fig. 4a & 4b) . These Fc 152 fusion sdAbs were produced in mammalian cells with suspension yields around 25-50 153 µg per milliliter in shaking flask. The supernatant samples were analyzed in both 154 reducing and non-reducing conditions in Western blot using an anti-human IgG to 155 detect Fc. As shown in Fig. 4c , the size of the constructed intact sdAb-Fc is around 80 156 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This suggests a correct 158 expression and secretion of heavy chain antibodies in consistence with our design. 159
Neutralization assay results showed that genetic fusion of human Fc significantly 160 increased the neutralization activity of these sdAbs for 10-to 80-fold in molar 161 concentration of IC 50 using the SARS-CoV-2pp entry assay (Fig. 4d) . Importantly, 162
several Fc-fused sdAbs demonstrated potency with IC 80 at sub-nanomolar level (Fig.  163 4d). Finally, we showed that some of the sdAbs are suitable for immunofluorescence 164 staining ( Supplementary Fig. 1) and Western blot to detect ectopically expressed 165 SARS-CoV-2 S protein ( Supplementary Fig. 2) .

A synthetic sdAb phage display library was used for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 220 neutralizing antibodies. To minimize a possible antigenic effect from camelid 221 sequences, sdAb frameworks for library construction were determined according to a 222 universal humanized scaffold architecture 7 . Briefly, residues in frames 1, 3 and 4 were 223 mutated based on human heavy chain VH in maximum. In frame 2, humanization of 224 residues at positions 49 and 50 was adopted to increase stability of sdAbs, whereas 225 residues 42 and 52 are maintained in camelid due to their critical impact on antigen 226 affinity and/or stability. For the design of variable regions, we analyzed a robust CDR 227 repertoire from immune or naïve llama VHH clones. A synthetic diversity was 228 introduced in the three CDRs by random nucleotide incorporation with cysteine and 229 stop codon avoided. A constant length of 8 amino acids was selected for CDR1 and 230 CDR2, and 18 amino acids for CDR3. Frameworks and CDRs were assembled by 231 overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ensuring each unique CDR recombined 232 in the assembled molecules.

Massive 235 electroporation was carried out using E. coli TG1 cells. More than a thousand agar 236 petri dishes (140 mm) were plated to ensure enough size of the library. Quality control 237 was carried out by sequencing more than 1000 clones, and the error rate and diversity 238 were calculated. 239
Screening for SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting antibodies was performed by panning in 241 both immunotubes and native condition using a proprietary full-synthetic library of 242 humanized sdAbs with high-diversity, according to a standard protocol. Briefly, for the 243 2 nd and 4 th panning rounds, the purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was coated on 244 Nunc MaxiSorp immuno tubes (ThermoFisher) at around 5µg/mL in PBS overnight. The absorbance was measured using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader from Molecular 257 Divices (San Jose, CA, USA). The positive clones were sent for sequencing, and 258 representative sdAb sequences were chosen for protein expression. 259

To produce SARS-CoV-2pp, HEK293T cells were seeded 1 day prior to transfection at 298 2.5×10 6 cells in a 10-cm plate. The next day, cells were transfected using 299
Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). The plasmid DNA transfection mixture (1 ml) 300 was composed of 15 µg of pNL-4.3-Luc-E -Rand 15 µg of pcDNA-SARS-CoV-2-S that 301 was purchased from Sino Biologicals and reconstructed by deletion of 18 amino acid 302 cytoplasmic tail. A nonenveloped lentivirus particle (Bald virus) was also generated as 303 negative control. Sixteen hours after transfection, the media was replaced with fresh 304 media supplemented with 2% FBS. Supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2pp were 305 typically harvested 36-48 h after transfection and then filtered through a syringe filter. 306
The typical relative luminometer units for SARS-CoV-2pp were between 10 6 and 10 7 . 307
To conduct the virus entry assay, Vero E6 or other cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 308 at 1 day prior to transduction. The next day, 100 µL of supernatant containing 309 SARS-CoV-2pp was added into each well in the absence or presence of serially 310 diluted sdAbs or human IgG1 Fc-fused sdAbs. Forty-eight hours after transduction, 311 cells were lysed in 100 µL of passive lysis buffer and 50 µL lysate was incubated with 312 100 µL of luciferase assay substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions 313 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). 314
