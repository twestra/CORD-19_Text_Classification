41 cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol. Genetically unrelated 42 viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar 43 trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early 44 steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for 45 successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here 46 potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric VSV 47 containing the envelope proteins of EBOV (VSV-EBOV) or SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-48 SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small molecule inhibitors of 49 the main endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-50 Kinase, PIKfyve. We also describe potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-51 nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 by Apilimod. These results define new tools for studying 52 the intracellular trafficking of pathogens elicited by inhibition of PIKfyve kinase 53 and suggest the potential for targeting this kinase in developing a small-molecule 54 antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.

Membrane-enveloped viruses deliver their contents to cells via envelope protein-57 catalyzed membrane fusion. Binding of virus to specific host cell receptor(s) triggers 58 membrane fusion, which can occur directly at the plasma membrane or following 59 endocytic uptake. Viruses that require endocytic uptake can use different initial 60 trafficking routes to reach the site of membrane fusion. In endosomes, acidic pH serves 61 to triggers conformational rearrangements in the viral envelope proteins that catalyze 62 membrane fusion, as seen for influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus blocking PIKfyve kinase has the same downstream effects on these viruses, even 113 though VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 does not require interaction with NPC1 for membrane 114 fusion. Apilimod also inhibits infection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-115 nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 virus, with an IC50 slightly lower than its IC50 for the VSV-eGFP-116 SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that Apilimod, which has passed safety tests in previous 117 human clinical trials for non-viral indications (24, 25, 29, 30), is a potential starting point 118 for developing small-molecule entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 that could limit infection 119 and disease pathogenesis. 120 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

ZEBOV also trafficked to all tagged species of enlarged endolysosomes, often reaching 198 one of the numerous NPC1-containing vacuoles enriched in EEA1 (Fig. 5C) . MeGFP-ZEBOV in EEA1-containing endosomes increased in the presence of Apilimod, 
To test the effect of Apilimod on bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection, we exposed Vero E6 217 cells to fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020); after 24 h 218 incubation, supernatants were harvested and tittered by focus-forming assay on a 219 separate set of Vero E6 cells (Fig. 7A) . Apilimod strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 220 infection, and the dose-response curve was similar or better than those observed for 221 VSV-eGFP-ZEBOV or VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 (IC50s ~ 10 nM) (Fig. 7B) . against the autoimmune condition for which the drug was tested. We suggest that one 288 of these compounds, or a potential derivative, would be a candidate broad-spectrum 289 therapeutic for several emerging human viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
