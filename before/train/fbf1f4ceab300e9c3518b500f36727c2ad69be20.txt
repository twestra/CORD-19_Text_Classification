Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in 1 Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality 2 ranging from 3% to 6%. To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this 3 paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon 4 usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. 5 We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its 6 codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary 7 pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved 8 genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and 9 nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias 10 and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we 11 show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly 12 by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid 13 (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and 14 antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest 15 that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the 16 development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV. 18 20 genome of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus -MHV), a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus, 21 was first reported in 1949. It belongs to the family Coronaviridae and ranges from 26.4 (ThCoV 22 HKU12) to 31.7 (SW1) kb in length [10], making it the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses, 23 with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43% [20]. The coronavirinae family consists of four genera 24 based on their genetic properties, including genus: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (subdivided in 25 subgroups A, B, C and D), Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Coronavirus can infect humans 26 and many different animal 2 of 20 bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, snake, and other wildlife animals. To date, 30 CoVs genomes have been 28 identified. Only seven CoVs have been identified that infect humans, including Human CoV-229E 29 (HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HumanCoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human 30 CoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), Middle East Respiratory 31 Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS CoV 2 ( nCoV) [26]. 32 Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in Wuhan (China) in 33 December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality rate from 3% to 6%. 34 The newly sequenced virus genome encodes two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, 35 the latter encodes replicase polyproteins, and four structural proteins [19], [9]: the spike-surface 36 glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein (M), and the 37 nucleocapsid protein (N). 38 The phenomenon of codon usage bias (CUB) exists in many genomes including RNA genomes and 39 it is actually determined by mutation and selection [1]. As it is well-known, the non-random choice 40 of synonymous codons varies among species that are potential host for viruses [11] [? ]. It is then 41 important to study patterns of common codon usage in coronaviruses because CUB can be related to 42 the driving forces that shape the evolution of small RNA viruses. Mutational bias has been considered 43 as the major determinant of codon usage variation among RNA viruses [13]. Indeed, RNA viruses 44 show an effective number of codons (ENC) that is quite high (ENC>45) pointing to a quite random 45 codon usage, whereas if one uses the adaptive index CAI then the viral CUB is consistent with that of 46 the host, as observed in the Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) or Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [5]. 47 65
We compared the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of the other coronavirus genomes. For 66 this purpose, we used the RSCU which is a biologically relevant metric of distance between the codon 67 usage in the protein-coding sequences of these genomes. In Fig. 1 , we report the heatmap of the RSCU 68 values associated with the coronavirus. The RSCU values of the majority of the codons scored between 69 0 and 3.1 (see legend in Figure 1). Interestingly, analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal 70 that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence has a clear origin from other 71 beta-CoV's and is closer, specifically, to SARSr-CoV, consistent with their phylogenetic relationships 72 (Figure A3). In line with previous observations, we show that the mean CpG relative abundance in the 73 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed [27]. Specifically, GGG, GGC, CCG (pyrimidine-CpG) 74 and ACG (purine-CpG) present a very low frequence of occurrence, probably due to the relative tRNA 75 abundance of the host. In fact, in human the abundance of tRNA in codons GGG, GGC, CCG and 76 ACG are respectavely: 0, 0, 4 and 7.
In 2019-nCoV, the most frequently used codons are CGU (arginine, 2.34 times) and GGU (glycine, 78 2.42), whereas the least used codons are GGG (glycine) and UCG (serine). We also note the most 79 frequently used codons for each amino acid, ended in either U or A. [5] 80 157 divergence. Each point in Forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of orthologous genes 158 in the two species, as projected along with the phenotypic (protein) and nucleotidic (DNA) axis.

The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of 48 coronavirus and explore the possible leading evolutionary determinants of the biases found. [19]. For nCoV we note a different trend T>A>G>C, but in totally AT% is more used than GC% (See 54   Table 3 ). The GC content in 2019-nCoV is 0.373 ± 0.05. 55 2.2. All the sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes share a common codon usage 56 We downloaded the protein-coding sequences of 2019-nCoV from GIDAID database, by did not cluster according to geographic location, thus confirming the common origin of these genomes. 63 Therefore, we will consider a unique vector to represent 2019-nCoV in the following analyses. 2.4. The codon usage of 2019-nCoV is not optimized to the host. 81 To measure the codon usage bias in the coronavirus genomes, we used the effective number 82 of codons (ENC) value and the Competition Adaptation Index (CAI). In Table 2 and 3, we report 83 the ENC and CAI values for all the coronaviruses we considered in this work. To visually enhance 84 the differences among the codon usage of these coronaviruses we calculated Zscore of a single virus 85 in relation to the other members of the CoV subfamily. Interestingly, the ENC value associated to 86 2019-nCoV (51.9 ± 2.59) is lower than the average of all Coronaviruses, meaning that 2019-nCoV uses 87 a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences. We also note that CAI of 2019-nCoV 88 (0.727 ± 0.054) is lower than the average one, underscoring that this coronavirus tend to use codons 89 that are not optimized to the host.

Genes M and E show quite low slopes, indicating that these proteins tend to evolve slowly by 165 accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, the steeper slopes for genes N, RdRP, 166 and S indicate that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other ones. A plausible explanation 167 for this observation is that protein N due to its immunogenicity, has been frequently used to generate 168 specific antibodies against various animal coronavirus, including in SARS [24] . The viral replicase 169 polyprotein that is essential for the replication of viral RNA and, finally, the gene S encodes the protein 170 that is responsible for the "spikes" present on the surface of coronaviruses. Taken together, our results 171 suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these proteins could represent a major obstacle 172 to in the development of a antiviral therapeutics against 2019-nCoV. 173 author/funder.

ENC is an estimate of the frequency of different codons used in a coding sequence. In general, ENC ranges from 20 (when each aminoacid is coded by just one and the same codon) to 61 (when all synonymous codons are used on an equal footing). Given a sequence of interest, the computation of ENC starts from F α , a quantity defined for each family α of synonymous codons (one for each amino acid):
where m α is the number of different codons in α (each one appearing n 1 α , n 2 α , ..., n m α times in the sequence) and n α = ∑ m α k=1 n k α . ENC then weights these quantities on a sequence:
where N S is the number of families with one codon only and K m is the number of families with 235 degeneracy m (the set of 6 synonymous codons for Leu can be split into one family with degeneracy 2, 236 similar to that of Phe, and one family with degeneracy 4, similar to that, e.g., of Pro). 237 We have evaluated ENC by using the implementation in DAMBE 5.0 [31]. 
Codon adaptation index CAI [? ] is used to quantify the codon usage similarities between the virus and host coding sequences. The principle behind CAI is that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal (i.e., most efficient for translation) codons for each amino acid. Hence, CAI is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess, for each codon i, the relative synonymous codon usages (RSCU i ) and the relative codon adaptiveness (w i ):
In the RSCU i , X i is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome, and the sum in the denominator runs over the n i synonyms of i; RSCUs thus measure codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons. w i is then defined as the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon for the same amino acid encoded by i-i.e., the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly expressed genes. The CAI for a given gene g is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene, normalized to the maximum CAI value possible for a gene with the same amino acid composition:
where the product runs over the l g codons belonging to that gene (except the stop codon).
This index values range from 0 to 1, where the score 1 represents the tendency of a gene to always The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.006569 doi: bioRxiv preprint
To study the patterns of codon bias in the coronaviruses, we use Z-score values:
where ENC f amily is the average of the ratio within a codon bias index in a family of a virus v, ENC v 246 and σ v are the average value of ENC and its standard deviation over the whole virus v, and N v is the 247 number of virus in the family (we use the standard deviation of the mean as we are comparing average 248 values).
The same Z-score is evalueted for codon bias index CAI. ENC-plot analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping CUB of genes encoding for proteins that are crucial for 2019-nCoV: RdRP, the spike-surface glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The ENC-plot is a plot in which the ENC is the ordinate and the GC3 is the abscissa. Depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection, different cases are discernable. If a gene is not subject to selection, a clear relationship is expected between ENC and GC3 [? ]: The following abbreviations are used in this manuscript: author/funder. All rights reserved.
