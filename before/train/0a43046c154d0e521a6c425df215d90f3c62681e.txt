300 words) 33 Quantification of aerosolized influenza virus is used for determining inhalation exposure. Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results 48 demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of 49 extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, 50 which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., 51 polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride 52 contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds). Air sampling did not 53 have an effect on viral RNA recovery. Using Hanks Balanced Salt Solution with QIAamp Viral .

Introduction minimize the effects of sampling stress and maximize recovery. The SKC Biosampler has been 78 found to have greater viral recovery compared to other commonly used filter-based samplers; 79 however, the differences across samplers were not statistically significant. [13] [14] [15] 80 81 Filters are used frequently as a sampling media in personal samplers in the field of exposure 82 assessment. Filter based samplers have also been used in the collection of aerosolized viruses due 83 to their efficiency in collecting sub-micrometer particles 10, 16 , and ability to be used for longer 84 periods in the field compared to impinger based methods. 17,18 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 85 polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, and gelatin-containing filters have all been used to 86 collect virus 10,19 , with PTFE and PVC being the most efficient among filter materials tested. 16, 19 87 Nevertheless, the viral recovery from PTFE and PVC filter materials remains inefficient. 10
There are many other materials that can be used to fabricate filters for collection of bioaerosols. 90 For example, a new filter material made from polystyrene (PS) has been developed to be used in 91 the collection of bioaerosols. PS filters have been fabricated from electrospun fibers, yielding 92 materials with large surface areas and small pore sizes that make them very efficient in filtering 93 applications. 20 The hydrophobicity of the PS filter material may assist the viral capsid attachment 94 proteins and other biomolecules to adsorb to the fiber surfaces. 21 Furthermore, the use of PS as a 95 centrifuge tube material is common in the field of molecular biology, therefore it is hypothesized 96 that PS will perform well as a filter material for sampling aerosolized virus in the field of 97 exposure science.

Airflow was adjusted during the experimental trial to 146 maintain a target 50% relative humidity during the entire experiment. Influenza A plasmid, a standard curve was generated for each RT-qPCR experiment. The anti-203 log (10ˣ) was then calculated to get total viral copies in the 5 µL of the isolated RNA PCR 204 reaction. The viral copy data were then volume adjusted to represent the total viral copies per 205 sample. Data were analyzed in R 35 using multiple linear regression at a single comparison type 1 206 error rate of 0.05. A random-effects model was also constructed to evaluate evidence for a batch 207 effect, though no systematic batch-to-batch variation was detected.

PTFE is often considered the optimal filter material in virus 242 collection 10 ; however, the results from this experiment suggest that PS outperforms PTFE for 243 viral recovery. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the RNA viral 244 recovery from PS used as a filter material in field of exposure science.

For the Trizol method, a visible RNA "pellet" was to be 289 observed after extraction, distinguishable from impurities in the sample. However, several 290 samples did not produce a visible pellet, making it more difficult to distinguish between the viral 291 RNA and the remaining impurities in the sample. Therefore, the Trizol method may have 292 resulted in additional loss of viral RNA. Viral recovery efficiency from each filter type was not 293 measured for each sample; therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in virus recovered 294 from the filter types in each sample had an effect on viral RNA copy variability.

Although the optimal 311 comfort level for humans is 40-60% RH 14 , and previous studies have found that higher RHs (i.e., 312 50-56%) have no effect on viral infectivity. 13 Relative humidity was measured using a single real 313 time measurement instrument in the chamber over the course of the experiment. We assumed the 314 experimental chamber was well mixed however, the RH may not have remained at 50% for all 315 sampling locations during the entire 30-minute sampling period.
