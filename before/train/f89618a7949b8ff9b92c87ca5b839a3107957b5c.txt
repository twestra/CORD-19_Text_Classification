Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine 36 EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in 37 Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, 38 and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene 39 replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese 40 farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking 41 sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream 42 flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the 43 downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence 44 homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the 45 novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. Although the 46 phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, 47 type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins 48 for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G. 49 50
Enterovirus G (EV-G) is an enveloped RNA virus, belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. 54 More than 20 types of EV-G, known as EV-G1 to EV-G20, have been identified [1, 2] .

By using a metagenomics approach, we have detected the genomes of EV-G1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 61 and a new type of EV-Gs in feces of pigs with or without diarrhea in Japan [3] . Among them, 16 62 isolates of EV-G1 and one isolate of EV-G2 show an insertion of a papain-like cysteine protease 63 (PLCP) gene from porcine torovirus at the 2C-3A junction sites [4] (Fig. 1A) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/510131 doi: bioRxiv preprint downstream flanking sequences (Fig. 1B) .
To confirm the genome sequence of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G obtained by 114 metagenomics analysis, we performed long RT-PCR to amplify the viral genome approximately 115 every 1 kb with overlapping regions and subjected the PCR products for direct sequencing (Fig. 1B) .
These analyses revealed that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G genome was approximately 6.7 kb-
