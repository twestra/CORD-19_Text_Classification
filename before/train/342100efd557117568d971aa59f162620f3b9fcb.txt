Following the recent report of a furin-like cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2, we characterized 23 additional amino acid residues, positioned within the crown of the spike (S) glycoprotein, under 24 diversifying selection along the ancestral lineage of currently circulating pandemic strains, and 25 affecting enhanced ability to infect host cells. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-26 range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation 27 with furin cleavage, and residue T333, under purifying selection, hinge of such movement.
28 Evolutionary analysis revealed that the current human lineage likely emerged after a 29 recombination event between ancestors in bat and pangolin. Recombination impacted residues 30 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 109 movement between CTD1 (residues between red lines in Figure 1f) and the region 828-852 110 (highlighted by cyan lines in Figure 1 f), encompassing a portion of the fusion peptide (Suppl.
111 Movie 3, in which residues 828-852 are highlighted in cyan). This co-variant movement between 112 CTD1 and the fusion peptide region is indicative of long range coordinated movements, functional 113 to the protein rearrangement during the fusion step (Figure 1f, Suppl. Movie 3). A correlated
located in the binding receptor region of S glycoprotein, identical to pangolin ancestor.
Interestingly, several recombination hotspots were detected throughout the genome, with the 32 exception of the S glycoprotein, which exhibits a coldspot in the N terminal region, possibly the 33 result of negative selection against changes that may reduce its optimal fitness.
Main -With a toll of confirmed cases rapidly increasing globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely 36 to meet the millions in matter of weeks. One of the features that may explain why this novel 37 betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been successfully spreading around the globe, is the newly 38 acquired furin-like cleavage site 1 . Furin is ubiquitously expressed at different levels in all 39 tissues 2,3 . However, kinetics of furin-like enzyme activity are different among species -e. g. Table   53   S1 ). Before diving into the new features, we define major domains of SARS-CoV-2 S 54 glycoprotein, based on the available SARS-CoV-1 structure 5 : S1 subunit, that binds to the 55 receptor on the host cell surface 6 , and S2 subunit which plays a role in membrane fusion 7 . In 56 particular, S1 is composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 14-294) and three C-terminal (Figure 1 ). The S2 subunit is located downstream of S1 66 after the S1/S2 cleavage site (residue 667 for SARS-CoV and residue 660 for SARS-CoV-2). The 67 majority of the residues that differentiate human S glycoproteins from bat or pangolin were found 68 within the S1 subunit ( Figure 1a ). The S glycoprotein was under strong negative/purifying 69 selection with 775 out of 1273 sites were under negative/purifying selection (Table S3) , which 70 suggests the protein has reached a peak on the fitness landscape in terms of structure, stability 71 and folding 11 . We detected six amino acid positions within the S1 subunit under 
(2X)n-(R/K)* (or RXXR*SA) motif for the S1/S2 cleavage 12,13 , the S glycoprotein of the recently 90 emerged SARS-CoV-2 presents a solvent exposed furin-like cleavage sequence (PRRARS*V) in 91 positions 681-684 1 . We carried out a 90 ns-long simulation to assess the stability of the trimeric 92 structure of SARS-CoV-2 and whether the new gained favorable furin-like cleavage site alters the 93 overall structure of the S glycoprotein.
As recently reported 14 , the CTD1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein for the pre-fusion 95 conformation rotates outward from center of the triangular head to an "up" position, while this 96 conformation for SARS-CoV is "down" 5 ( Figure 1f ). One monomer of the SARS-CoV-2 S 97 glycoprotein, in fact, acquired the ability of being already in a pre-fusion conformation pointing the 98 ACE2 binding site in a different angle than its predecessor, thus giving SARS-CoV-2 99 advantageous ability to bind and enter into the cell. To test whether specific evolutionary 100 pressures allowed SARS-CoV-2 to display enhanced binding to the human binding receptor, we (Table S4) . Human SARS-
CoV-2 strains were identified as potential parental sequences recombining with pangolin-SARS-
CoV-2 isolated in 2019 and bat-SARS-CoV-2 strains; with a recombination event involving the 159 region of the S glycoprotein that binds to the cell receptor (Table 1) . This finding matches the 160 previous observation that ACE2 binding residues are shared between pangolin and human, and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015685 doi: bioRxiv preprint forming hydrogen bonds with the host cell receptor 9 . In spite of the frequency of recombination 225 events involving the S glycoprotein, the 5' end of the gene might sit into a recombination coldspot.
While mutation/recombination events in the glycoprotein RBD might expand the virus tropism, 227 recombination coldspots and negative/diversifying selective pressure limit its variability to 228 maintain correct structure, and therefore function.

Genetic data
Publicly available genomic CoVs sequences were obtained from GenBank and GISAID (Table S1 246 and S5). To gather closely related CoVs BLASTn was performed using the ViPR database and 247 keeping the first 100 hits. Genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT and refined manually 49 .
Alignments for the glycoprotein were extracted from the genome alignment. Table S4 .
