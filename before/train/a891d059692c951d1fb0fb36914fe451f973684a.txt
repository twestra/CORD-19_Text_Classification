Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is 36 prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the 37 coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host 38 specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular 39 elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory 40 epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. 41 We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving 42 that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that 43 protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus 44 and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may 45 be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand 46 the differences in their zoonotic potential. : bioRxiv preprint
Coronaviruses are the largest group within the order Nidovirales. Mainly, they cause 49 respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious 50 conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect 51 humans, four of which (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and 52 HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (SARS-53 CoV and MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and 54 multiorgan failure (1-6). Furthermore, in December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 55 emerged in Hubei province, China, causing pneumonia. To date, almost 90,000 cases were 56 identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide. 57 Coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (S) protein 58 and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. A number of adhesion 59 and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. For example, HCoV-229E (similar 60 to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as the primary entry port 61 (7). Surprisingly, its cousin HCoV-NL63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily 62 distant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8-63 11). HCoV-NL63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site (12-14). 64 A very different receptor is recognized by MERS-CoV, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 65 (DPP4) (9, 15, 16). Another betacoronavirus, HCoV-OC43, binds to N-acetyl-9-O-66 acetylneuraminic acid (17, 18). HCoV-HKU1 remains the great unknown because its cellular 67 receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed.
68 HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in 2004. The virus was present in a sample 69 obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia (19). Epidemiological studies show a 70 high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) and human 73 alveolar type II cells support the infection (22-25). A thorough study by Huang X et al. 74 demonstrated that HCoV-HKU1 binds to target cells via O-acetylated sialic acids on the cell 75 surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. The study also showed that 76 the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of HCoV-HKU1 exhibits sialate-O-acetylesterase 77 activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral 78 progeny (26). Bakkers et al. proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human 79 respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, HCoV-HKU1 lost the ability to bind to 80 attachment receptors via the HE protein (27). Recently, Hulswit et al. mapped the virus binding 81
site to O-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the S1 domain A is responsible for binding 82 to the attachment receptor (28).
The S protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics 84 determine the host range. Coronaviral S proteins are class I fusion proteins comprising a large 85 N-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small C-terminal 86 endodomain. The ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of S1 and S2 domains.
The globular S1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the 88 more conserved rod-like S2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which 89 brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. Such a structural switch may be 90 triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, 91 and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter 92 cells at different subcellular sites. Some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas 93 others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion 94 deep within the endosomal compartments (29-35). Furthermore, recent reports show that the 95 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. These differences may affect the 96 host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity (1). 97 Host proteases prime coronaviral S proteins. For example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in 98 the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (36), while a number 99 of coronaviruses from different genera (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, murine 100 hepatitis virus [MHV], MERS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) possess a furin 101 cleavage site (37-41). Kam et al. showed that SARS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by plasmin; 102 however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo (42). Cathepsins may also 103 act as S protein-activating enzymes. Indeed, cathepsin L processes the S proteins of SARS-104 CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MHV-2 (43-46). However, recent reports show that, in 105 vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the TMPRSS2 protease, which enables 106 endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process (45, 47-50). 107 While laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, S proteins of clinical isolates (e.g., 108 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) undergo TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface, 109 which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface (51). A recent study by 110 Shirato et al. demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally 111 permissive HAE cultures during cell culture adaptation because the S gene evolves and adjusts 112 to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells (51).

Here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (KLK) family as a new 114 player essential for HCoV-HKU1 entry to the target cell. The KLK family comprises 15 closely 115 related serine proteases with trypsin-or chymotrypsin-like specificity. The expression of these 116 enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique KLK expression profile. These 117 enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood 118 (52-56), and some have been linked to human cancers (57-60). The function of some KLKs 119 remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an 120 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
important factor pre-determining the cell and tissue specificity of the virus, but also regulating 121 the interspecies transfers.
Further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient 123 in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. It is also of 124 importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help 125 to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential. 128 First, we asked whether HCoV-HKU1 infection modulates the expression of human 129 KLKs. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 or mock-inoculated. At 120 h post-130 inoculation (p.i.), cells were collected and the expression of mRNAs encoding KLKs was 131 analyzed. We detected the expression of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 in 132 non-infected fully differentiated cultures. However, the pattern in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells 133 was different: we detected an upregulation of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11 and KLK13. 134 Further, KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK9, KLK12 and KLK14 were expressed in the infected cells. 135 KLK2, KLK3, and KLK15 were not expressed (Fig. 1). 136 137 KLK13 is essential for HCoV-HKU1 infection 138 S protein priming is a prerequisite for coronavirus entry; therefore, we tested whether 139 KLKs take part in this process by culturing cells in the presence/absence of KLK inhibitors ( 140 Table 1 ) (61). For this, HAE cultures were pre-incubated with each inhibitor (10 µM) or with 141 vehicle control (DMSO) and mock-inoculated or inoculated with the virus (10 6 RNA copies per 142 ml) in the presence of the inhibitor. Apical washes were collected each day for analysis of virus 143 replication. Subsequently, viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed (RT), and the HCoV-144 HKU1 yield was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results showed that 145 HCoV-HKU1 replication was inhibited in the presence of a KLK13 inhibitor; this was not the 146 case for cells treated with DMSO or with inhibitors specific for KLK7 or KLK8 ( Fig. 2A) . 147 Next, we analyzed HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of a family-specific KLK 148 inhibitor SPINK6 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml (62, 63) or 100 µM camostat (a broad inhibitor 149 of serine proteases, also a potent inhibitor of KLK13) (34, 64).

HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of both inhibitors (Fig. 2B) . All inhibitors were used 151 at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C) . 152 The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection. 153 However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that 154 KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE 155 cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13 156 mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13). (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed 162 pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B) . Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and 163 HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (10 6 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at 164 32°C with the viral stock solution. Cultures were maintained at 32°C for 5 days at an air-liquid 165 interface. Apical washes were collected, and virus yield was determined by RT-qPCR. We 166 found that, in contrast to that in control cultures, replication of virus in HAE_shKLK13 was 167 abolished (Fig. 3C) . Overall, these data suggest that silencing the KLK13 gene in HAE inhibits 168 virus infection, indicating that KLK13 is necessary for HCoV-HKU1 infection. 171 We determined that KLK13 is essential for efficient HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint proteases my render RD cells permissive, we generated RD cells expressing human KLK13 or 176 TMPRSS2 proteases. RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13 177 gene (RD_KLK13), control vector (RD_ctrl), or TMPRSS2 (RD_TMPRSS2). Due to the lack 178 of KLK13 specific antibodies, we verified its presence based on RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) . The 179 presence of TMPRSS2 in RD_TMPRSS2 cells was confirmed using Western blot. The 180 TMPRSS2 band in RD cells was observed at 25 kDa, which corresponds to one of the naturally 181 occurring splicing variants (Fig. 4B) . Subsequently, we transduced RD_ctrl, RD_KLK13 and pseudoviruses, compared to ΔEnv, which was completely abolished in the presence of KLK13 193 inhibitor (Fig 4D) . Overall, these data demonstrated that KLK13 activity drives HCoV-HKU1 194 entry into cells. 195 196 KLK13 enables the replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells 197 Obtained results showed that KLK13 expression on RD cells was sufficient for HCoV-198 HKU1 pseudovirus entry. Here, we aimed to test whether KLK13 presence renders RD cells 199 permissive for HCoV-HKU1 infection. For this, we infected RD_ctrl and RD_KLK13 cells 200 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Next, cellular RNA was isolated 202 and the presence of HCoV-HKU1 N subgenomic mRNA (N sg mRNA), which is considered 203 to be a hallmark of coronaviral infection, was assessed (14). sg mRNA appeared in RD_KLK13 204 cells, while no signal was detected in cultures supplemented with the KLK13 inhibitor nor in 205 RD_ctrl cells (Fig. 5A) . 206 To further confirm the role of KLK13 during HCoV-HKU1 infection RD HCoV-HKU1 infection was analyzed by means of N sg mRNA detection. Again, we found that 212 N sg mRNA was produced only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . Further, we passaged in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . However, we observed no cytopathic effects (CPEs), and 218 replication levels were very low (no significant increase over control levels on RT-qPCR; data 219 not shown). To further test the effect of KLK13 on replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells, the 220 virus stock was incubated with purified KLK13 (200 nM) and incubated in the presence or 221 absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 µM) or DMSO. After 2 h at 32°C pre-treated virus stock was 222 diluted in media as described above and overlaid on RD cells. After 7 days at 32°C we evaluated 223 the presence of the HCoV-HKU1 N sg mRNA. The virus replicated only after treatment with 224 KLK13, and supplementation with the inhibitor blocked this effect infection (Fig. 5C) . 225 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting 238 with antibodies specific for His-tagged proteins. The analysis showed that, in the presence of 239 500 nM KLK13, the CleavEx protein harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site was degraded; however, 240 the CleavEx protein harboring the S2/S2' site remained intact. Because KLKs are produced as 241 pro-forms that undergo self-activation, an additional band of His-tagged purified pro-KLK13 242 (HisTag-pro-KLK13) was observed after treatment with 500 nM KLK13 (Fig. 6A) . The product 243 of the S1/S2 cleavage was further sequenced by N-terminal Edman degradation showing the 244 following sequence: R↓SISA, which corresponds to the S1/S2 site. This result shows clearly 245 that the S1/S2 region of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein is prone to KLK13-mediated cleavage. 246 Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the cleavage using a full-length Spike protein of HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1-S). For this, we expressed the HKU1-S in 293T cells, purified the protein 248 using 6 × His tag, and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with increasing concentrations of purified 249 KLK13.

The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint concentrations(63). Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, 281 although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al. 282 showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several 283 proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is 284 not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and 285 TMPRSS2 (81). We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory (61).
Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three 287 compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that 288 only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the 289 great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, 290 despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in 291 HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of 292 KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound(82, 83). 293 This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of 294 different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semi-295 quantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation 296 after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could 297 be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only 298 been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones (84). It is also 299 important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction 300 of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster (85, 86). While one may 301 assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation 302 is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take 303 part also in tissue regeneration (87-89). Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the 304 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The experiments performed herein show the importance of KLK13 for virus entry into 307 susceptible cells; therefore, we speculated that scattered distribution of different KLKs in 308 different tissues may be one of the determinants of the HCoV-HKU1 tropism (53, 91). We 309 tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell 310 line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD 311 cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus (26). Here, using 312 pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells 313 is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed 314 that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process(51). Furthermore, 315 we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and 316 that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, 317 not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD 318 cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the 319 amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are 320 considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to 321 non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or 322 low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient 323 replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results
show that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger 325 virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.

While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein 332 biosynthesis, the S2/S2' site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the 338 S2/S2' region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing 339 for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of 340 results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.
Also here we observed efficient cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13.
