The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also 31 protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing 32 of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. 33
By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34
, we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are 35 required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis 36 virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that 39 activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. 42 Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and 43 endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, 44 cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives 45 low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts 46 RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. 48 . Importance 49 Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING 50 DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate 51 without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS's DNA binding and signaling 53 activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host 55 DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression 56
correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of 58 endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation. doi: bioRxiv preprint 61 A key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated 62 molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1). For 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct PRRs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to set up an antiviral state. During RNA 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded RNAs are detected in the cytosol by 66 the PRRs retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and related RIG-I-like receptors 67 (RLRs). However, the recent discovery of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict RNA viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during RNA virus 70 infection. 71 The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates ISG expression when 73 overexpressed (2). Although STING is involved in DNA sensing, STING -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (MEFs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (VSV), a negative-stand RNA virus (2, 3). Additionally, studies in MEFs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cDNAs (4), have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of RNA viruses and retroviruses, 79
presumably due to the accumulation of DNA in the cytosol (5, 6). It appears that this 80 DNA-based restriction is broad, as many RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cGAS-STING pathway, including flaviviruses (7-9), hepaciviruses (10, 82
STING does not directly interact with cytosolic DNA, but functions as an innate 84 immune adaptor protein to transduce signals between cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 85 (cGAS) and Tank-binding kinase 1, which subsequently phosphorylates the 86 transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to initiate an ISG response doi: bioRxiv preprint 157
158 growth of VSV-GFP, VSVΔM51A-GFP, and SINV-GFP, while THP-1 KO cells or 159 THP-1 KO cells reconstituted with inactive hcGAS-HA3x mutants showed little or no 160 restriction (Figure 3D-3F). As observed previously in MEFs, VSVΔM51A-GFP was 161 more potently restricted than VSV-GFP, but unlike in MEFs, infected fewer cells 162 expressing mutant cGAS. This was also true for SINV-GFP, albeit restriction with 163 WT hcGAS-HA3x was extremely potent, comparatively. It is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cGAS mutants was due to hcGAS-HA3x 165 overexpression in THP-1 cells, residual hcGAS activities, or normal clonal 166 variation of cells. Nevertheless, these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cGAS DNA binding and cGAMP synthase activities in RNA virus restriction. 168 Detection of cGAMP produced in response to DNA transfection but not 169 RNA virus infection.

Introduction mechanisms and may restrict RNA virus replication independent of IRF3 activation 89 (20) . 90 cGAS is a nucleic acid-binding protein specific for dsDNA and DNA:RNA hybrids 91 that also has nucleotidyl transferase activity (21) (22) (23) (24) . DNA binding induces structural 92 changes to form the cGAS active site, which synthesizes a non-canonical 5´-2'-and 93 5´-3'-linked cyclic dinucleotide known as cyclic guanosine monophosphate-94 adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) (25-28). cGAMP is a diffusible secondary 95 messenger that specifically binds to STING with high affinity (K D ~4 nM), thereby 96 inducing a downstream innate immune response (29) (30) (31) (32) . 97
For RNA viruses that replicate in the cytosol without a DNA intermediate, the 98 specific ligands that activate cGAS remain unclear. At present, the prevailing 99 hypothesis is that RNA viruses induce release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into 100 the cytosol, thereby activating innate immune responses (7, (33) (34) (35) (36) . However, it is 101 unclear whether mitochondrial damage is a conserved feature of RNA virus 102 infection, nor is it clear that cGAS-STING activation follows the same pathway for 103 both RNA and DNA viruses. 104 In this study, we investigated whether the DNA binding and cGAMP synthesis 105 activities of human cGAS (hcGAS) are required for RNA virus restriction. While both 106 activities were required, the amount of cGAMP produced during virus infection was 107 too low to detect. We also confirmed that hcGAS binds mtDNA in both uninfected 108 and infected cells but did not observe increased cytosolic or cGAS-associated 109 mtDNA in response to RNA virus infection. We found that cGAS stimulated 110 smoldering, low-level innate immune activation, most likely in response to 111 endogenous DNA ligands, suggesting that cGAS-STING can passively restrict 112 incoming RNA viruses. 113 .

were used in these experiments because this cell line lacks endogenous cGAS 174 expression and could be reconstituted with WT or mutant hcGAS-HA3x; however, 175 unlike MEFs and THP-1 KO cells, HEK 293E cells could be efficiently transfected 176 with DNA and readily scaled up for isolation of cGAMP from cytosolic extracts. As 177 shown in Figure 4A , a unique UHPLC peak (~5 minutes elution) was observed after 178 transfecting WT hcGAS-HA3x-expressing HEK 293E cells with salmon sperm DNA; 179 MS analysis confirmed that this peak corresponded to cGAMP (Figures 4B and 4C) . published cGAMP bioassays (21). Again, we were unable to detect cGAMP in 194 lysates from VSV-infected or SINV-infected THP-1 cells expressing WT hcGAS, 195 while a synthetic cGAMP control led to robust phosphorylation of IRF3 ( Figure 4I ). 196
To validate that cell-derived cGAMP could be detected by this assay, a time-course 197 experiment was conducted by transfecting HEK 293E cells expressing WT hcGAS 198 with salmon sperm DNA, revealing the time-dependent increase in cGAMP (Figure 199 4J). Furthermore, we found that transfected cGAMP was rapidly turned over within 200 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Collectively, these results indicate that if 202 cGAMP is produced in response to RNA virus infection, it may be produced at levels 203 below the limit of our detection and/or rapidly turned over. 204 cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA at steady state and during RNA virus 205 infection. Given that cGAS DNA binding activity was also required for RNA virus 206 restriction, we sought to identify DNA ligands of cGAS during RNA virus infection. 207
First, we identified conditions to specifically co-immunoprecipitate cGAS and 208 mtDNA, a known DNA ligand (34). As shown in Figure 5A To more broadly assess cytosolic and hcGAS-bound DNAs, we developed deep 220 sequencing libraries from cytosolic extracts or after immunoprecipitation of WT 221 hcGAS-HA3x. The first one-third of the mitochondrial genome was specifically 222 enriched in cytosolic preps from both uninfected and VSV-GFP-infected MEFs 223 ( Figure 5F ). Similarly, mtDNA was also highly enriched after immunoprecipitation of 224 hcGAS-HA3x, although there was a bias for the latter three-quarters of the genome 225 ( Figure 5G ). Importantly, there was no obvious difference in mtDNA pulldown 226 between uninfected and infected cells. Collectively, these data indicate that VSV 227 does not induce cytosolic release of mtDNA to stimulate cGAS activation. Consistent 228 with this, VSV-GFP replicated equally well in LMTK cells and mtDNA-depleted LMTK 229 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Collectively, these data 230 suggest that mtDNA is dispensable for cGAS-mediated restriction of an RNA virus. 231
Although VSV is a negative-strand RNA virus that replicates solely via RNA 232
intermediates, it has been reported that VSV-specific cDNAs can arise in infected 233 cells, presumably through reverse transcriptase (RT) activity encoded by 234 endogenous retroelement(s) (42). We therefore investigated whether such viral 235 cDNAs arose during VSV-GFP infections in our laboratory. Indeed, VSV N 236 gene-specific cDNAs were generated in infected cells, although in extremely low 237 abundance, ~1 copy/10 4 cells ( Figure 5I ). The cDNA origin of the N gene template 238 was confirmed by nuclease treatment ( Figure 5J ), by its sensitivity to tenofovir, an 239 RT inhibitor that had no effect on VSV replication ( Figure S3A ), and by its enhanced 240 expression in cells devoid of TREX1 nuclease ( Figure S3B ). We also identified 241 virus-specific cDNAs in cells infected with yellow fever virus (YFV), a positive-strand 242 RNA virus ( Figure S3C ), suggesting that cDNA formation is a general feature of RNA 243 virus infections. Finally, to determine whether cDNA formation was specific to 244 virus-infected cells or to viral transcripts, we examined whether cDNA forms of an 245 abundant housekeeping gene, GAPDH, arose in uninfected cells. Indeed, 246 splice-dependent GAPDH cDNAs were identified in low abundance by qPCR ( Figure  247 5K). Importantly, VSV or retroelement cDNAs were not detected in deep sequencing 248 analyses of whole cytosol or cGAS-HA immunoprecipitations, likely due to their low 249
Collectively, our results indicate that cGAS binds mtDNA in both infected and 251 uninfected cells, and that VSV infection does not induce the release of mtDNA into 252 the cytosol or increase cGAS-bound mtDNA. Additionally, viral and cellular 253 mRNA-specific cDNAs can be detected, but are of extremely low abundance, less 254 than one copy per 10 4 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that steady state 255 levels of cytosolic DNA, rather than virus-induced DNAs, may provide ligands for 256 cGAS-mediated restriction of RNA virus replication. 257 .

Based on the above 258 results, we hypothesized that cGAS may serve to program baseline levels of innate 259 immune activation rather than strictly in response to RNA virus infection. To address 260 this, we analyzed ISRE-driven luciferase expression in uninfected THP-1 cells To examine whether cGAS drives basal levels of innate immune activation in 279 vivo, we examined ISG expression in vaginal tissue from uninfected WT B6J mice or 280 in mice defective for several innate immunity pathways. As shown in Fig. 7 Although cGAS was previously reported to restrict RNA viruses (50), it has been 301 widely assumedthough unproventhat this restriction depends on cGAS's DNA 302 binding and cGAMP synthase activities. Here, we used genetic knockout and 303 transgenic replacement to determine that both DNA binding and cGAMP synthase 304 activities are essential for cGAS-mediated restriction of RNA viruses. One caveat to 305 this approach is that gene knockout can have far-reaching network-level effects on 306 transcription, which are just beginning to be unearthed (51). A second caveat is that 307 reconstituted cGAS was slightly overexpressed in THP-1 cells, which, at least for WT 308 cGAS, can induce ISG expression (50, 52) and may have exaggerated the 309 response. Nevertheless, our results in THP-1 cells were consistent with results 310 obtained from MEFs (Figure 3 ), which did not overexpress cGAS. Taken together, 311 these data establish that DNA binding and cGAMP synthase activities are required 312 for cGAS-mediated RNA virus restriction. 313 .

Our results are consistent 316 with results recently reported by Franz et al., who were also unsuccessful in 317 detecting cGAMP production in . While Franz and colleagues 318 concluded that cGAMP is not produced in response to VSV infection, we also 319 considered the possibility that cGAMP levels may be below the limit of detection 320 and/or rapidly degraded. Whereas cGAMP synthesis is readily detected in response 321
to DNA transfection, this may simply reflect the wide dynamic range of cGAS in 322 response to overloading the cytosol with transfected DNA. Moreover, it has been 323 exceedingly difficult to detect cGAMP after virus infections, even for DNA viruses. 324
to cytomegalovirus infection was cell type-dependent, despite active cGAS-STING 326 expression. Where cGAMP was detected, levels were on the order of 5 fmol/10 4 327 cells, or ~3x10 5 molecules/cell, which was slightly above their assay's limit of 328 detection (53). As our biochemical and biological assays were both less sensitive 329 than that of Paijo et al., we surmise that the synthesis of cGAMP in response to RNA 330 virus infection is below the limit of detection and/or may be rapidly turned over. 331 Alternatively, continuous low-level production of cGAMP in response to endogenous 332 DNA ligands may be more relevant to RNA virus restriction. Clearly, cGAMP assays 333 with improved sensitivity are needed to discern between these possibilities. 334
Because cGAS DNA binding activity was required for VSV restriction, we 335 examined whether VSV introduces cGAS DNA ligands into the cytosol. Prior work 336 has shown that the cytosolic release of mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway 337 (33-35); moreover, infection with HSV-1, a DNA virus, or dengue virus, an RNA 338 virus, reportedly causes cytosolic release of mtDNA (34, 40). An emerging concept 339 is that mammalian cells may regulate the efflux of mtDNA into the cytosol in 340 response to stress, supported by a role for the Bax/Bak pore in mtDNA release as 341 well as mitochondrial inner membrane release mechanisms via permeabilization and 342 .

In contrast, the levels of cytosolic mtDNA and 343 cGAS-associated mtDNA did not increase during VSV infection. Moreover, 344 cGAS-STING-mediated VSV restriction was intact in  0 cells, which lack mtDNA, 345 consistent with similar experiments reported by Franz et al. (20) . Real-time 346 examination of mitochondrial dynamics may be needed to clarify the role of mtDNA 347 release during RNA virus infections. 348
Given that cGAS recognizes RNA:DNA hybrids (22), as well as a recent report of 349 VSV cDNAs (42), we also quantitated viral cDNAs produced during VSV infection. 350
We confirmed that rare viral and cellular cDNAs are indeed produced, most likely by 351 an endogenous cellular RT; however, the abundance of any given cDNA was 352 incredibly low, ~1 copy per 10 4 cells. This was less than the amount of VSV N-gene 353 cDNA previous reported by Shimizu, et al. (42) , which we attribute to the enhanced 354 specificity of our hydrolysis probe-based assay vs. SYBR green assays.

Additional 372 work will be needed to definitively identify the relevant DNA ligands that activate 373 cGAS; we suggest that pre-existing baseline stimuli should be considered. 374
While ISG expression served as a convenient and sensitive readout of baseline 375 cGAS-STING activation in our studies, it should be noted that we did not 376 demonstrate that low-level ISG expression directly contributes to RNA virus 377 restriction. On the surface, our results may seem at odds with those of Franz et al., 378 who recently reported that STING restricts RNA viruses, including VSV, in an 379 ISG-independent manner (20). However, we do not exclude the possibility that 380 smoldering cGAS activation may also contribute to ISG-independent mechanisms of 381 virus restriction via STING. 382
In summary, we propose that cGAS may become activated in response to RNA 383 virus infection, such as by virus-induced mtDNA release, but also contributes to RNA 384 virus restriction via constitutive, low-level innate immune activation, likely via 385 recognition of endogenous DNA ligands (Fig. 8) .

A succession of 4°C spins was 573 performed, retaining the supernatant for each step: 3x 1,000 x g for 3 minutes, 1x 574 16,100 x g for 10 minutes, 1x 100,000 x g for 1 hour on a 0.34 M sucrose cushion 575 (SW41 Ti rotor, Beckman). The final supernatant was then processed for western 576 blotting, above, and DNA purification, below. 577 DNA purification and phi29 amplification. DNA was isolated from total cytosol 578 by treating samples with RNase A and RNase T1 (Ambion) for 1 hour at 37°C, 579 digesting with Proteinase K for 1 hour at 55°C, and heat inactivating at 95°C for 15 580 minutes. DNAs were then purified with the QiaQuick purification kit (Qiagen). To 581 isolate DNA from immunoprecipitates, crosslinks were reversed by adding 5 M NaCl 582 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/434027 doi: bioRxiv preprint
