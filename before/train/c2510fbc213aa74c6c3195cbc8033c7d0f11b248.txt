Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogenic virus that 24 causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages. Deoxynivalenol (DON), the 25 most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals 26 and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains 27 unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of 28 PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-29 seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, 30 receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 μg/kg DON, respectively. We 31 observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and 32 the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in 33 experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like 34 vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in 35 experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 36 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted 37 in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and 38 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced 39 occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs 40 post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM 41 DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. Specifically, 42 deletion of LC3B indicated a crucial role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a

Pretreatment with SB202190, a p38 signaling inhibitor, abolished the 44 induction of autophagy. Furthermore, downregulation of type I interferon revealed that 45 DON contributed PEDV to escape innate immune. Mechanistically, DON-caused 46 innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited 47 STING phosphorylation. Taken together, DON could promote PEDV infection by 48 inducing occludin internalization and innate immune escape via triggering p38-49 mediated autophagy.
50 Author summary 53 Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease, leads to catastrophic 54 economic loss to the global pig industry. Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED 55 virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor 56 of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We 57 guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig 58 intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the 59 present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell 60 line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, 61 morbidity and gut barrier. Our results showed that DON exposure can promote PEDV 62 infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be related to LC3B-63 mediated autophagy. Our findings reveal new pathways for developing potential novel . CC-BY 4.0
the entirety of this autophagic process and is regulated by lots of signaling [17, 18] .
86 Autophagy principally serves a regulatory mechanism to control the innate immune 87 response against intracellular pathogens [19] [20] [21] . On the contrary, in certain viral 88 infection settings, the self-cannibalistic or, paradoxically, even the pro-survival 89 functions of autophagy may be deleterious. Evidence suggest that some viruses, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/852608 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 127
Low doses exposure of DON could trigger autophagy in the intestinal tissues of 128 weaning piglets.
To explore whether autophagy can be induced in piglets exposed to DON, the 130 intestinal autophagy levels of piglets in experiment groups were measured by testing 131 the autophagosome-like vesicles formation using TEM and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio 132 using immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 1E , a larger number of double-or single-133 membrane vesicles (black asterisk) were observed in jejunum of piglets with the basal 134 diet containing 750 and 1500 μg/kg DON compared with piglets received a basal diet.
135 The LC3-II/LC3-I ratios were also significantly increased in the duodenum, jejunum, 136 ileum and mesenterium of piglets in II and III groups compared with that of piglets in 137 I group (Fig 1I and 1J ). These data indicated that DON could trigger autophagy in 138 PEDV-infected piglets, which might be related to DON-promoted PEDV infection as 139 autophagy can facilitate to PEDV proliferation [22] .
Low concentrations of DON could facilitate PEDV entry in IPEC-J2 cells.
To eliminate the effects of DON on cytotoxicity, the viability of IPEC-J2 cells treated 142 with different concentrations of DON was analyzed by enzymatic reduction of MTT.

To explore the mechanism that low concentrations exposure of DON could facilitate 161 PEDV entry, we analyzed the protein levels of the tight junction proteins (ZO-1, 162 occludin and claudin-1) in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells exposed to DON. As 163 determined by immunoblotting, the protein levels of claudin-1 were significantly 164 decreased by 0.5 and 1.0 μM DON and that of ZO-1 had changed little, however, that 165 of occludin were significantly increased by 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM DON in PEDV-infected 166 IPEC-J2 cells (Fig 3A) . The cellular expression and distribution of occludin and 167 claudin-1 were measured to further explore the relationship between tight junction 168 proteins and DON-promoted PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells.

analysis (IFA) showed that tight junction formation in mock cells; PEDV infection 170 induced the slight internalization of occludin, not claudin-1, indicating that occludin 171 staining in the junctional area was decreased, and that in cytoplasm was increased;
172 meaning that DON aggravated the internalization of occludin ( Fig 3B) . 
To determine whether autophagy could also play a role in DON-promoted PEDV 206 replication, the level of LC3B was examined and the results showed that DON 207 treatment led to a significant upregulation of LC3-II expression (Fig 6A and 6B ). The were also significantly blocked (Fig 10C and 10D gastroenteritis virus and porcine rotavirus as determined by fecal and blood diagnostics.
Twenty-seven out of eighty piglets (BW= 5.5 ± 0.5 kg) were selected and randomly 360 divided into three groups, with 3 replicates per group and 3 piglets per replicate. Piglets
