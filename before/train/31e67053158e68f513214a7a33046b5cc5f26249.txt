25 Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated 26 with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the 27 nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural 28 areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which 29 allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and 30 demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers' 31 behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on 32 the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, 33 we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of 34 honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of 35 precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the 36 expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin 37 (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and 38 behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels 39 in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and 40 nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen 41 ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and 42 susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong 43 negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes 44 associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms 45 by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral 46 infections. 48 Approximately 35-40% of the world's crop production comes from plant species that depend on 49 animal pollination [1] which is carried out primarily by honey bees [2]. However, populations of 50 honey bees have experienced a severe decline during recent years worldwide [3, 4]. Possible 51 causes for colony losses have been proposed, including the effects of pesticides [5], nutritional 52 stress [6-8], the parasitic mite Varroa destructor [9, 10] and synergistic interactions between 53 Varroa and honey bee viruses [11]. However, none of these independent factors is consistently 54 associated with colony losses to suggest a single causal agent [3]. Thus, colony losses are likely 55 the result of the combination of several underlying factors [12, 13].
56 57 There are several lines of evidence indicating that nutritional stress is an important contributing 58 factor for colony losses. First, there is a positive relationship between the area of uncultivated 59 forage land surrounding an apiary and annual colony survival [6, 8] suggesting that habitat loss 60 play a significant role in honeybee colony losses. Second, at individual levels, honey bees from 61 colonies kept in areas of high cultivation exhibited decreased levels of physiological biomarkers 62 associated with nutrition compared with bees kept in areas of low cultivation [7, 14], 63 demonstrating that availability of floral resources affects the nutritional state of honey bees. 64 65 Habitat loss associated with increased use of monocultures reduces both the quality (diversity of 66 plant sources) and the quantity of the pollen collected by the bees [15]. Simultaneous flowering in 67 monocultures provide pollen for a restricted period, and hives surrounded by monocultures 68 presumably experience pollen dearth before and after this period. Pollen is the main source of 69 proteins and lipids for honey bees [16, 17] and pollen from different plants differ in amino acid 70 content [18, 19] and fatty acids [20]. Thus, the consumption of pollen from diverse plant sources 71 increases the probability of obtaining the set of nutritional components (e.g., essential amino 4 72 acids and fatty acids) required for balanced nutrition. 73 74 Plasticity is a key feature of honey bee behavioral development [21], which is important for 75 understanding the consequences of nutritional stress on colony health and fitness. In the honey 76 bee, as in other eusocial insects, behavioral division of labor in workers is initially age-dependent 77 [21, 22]. Under typical spring and summer conditions in temperate climates, honey bee lifespan is 78 approximately one month. During the first two to three weeks of adult life, workers perform tasks 79 in the hive such as brood care ("nursing"); while in the last one to two weeks of life, workers 80 forage for food outside the colony [23, 24]. However, honey bee behavioral development is 81 flexible and can be accelerated or delayed according to colony demography and as an adaptive 82 response to different challenges [21]. In particular, the timing of nurse to forager transition is 83 normally accelerated in response to diverse types of stressors, including diseases [25] and 84 malnutrition [26]. 85 86 Interactions among key elements of the extended insulin/insulin-like growth signaling/target of 87 rapamycin (IIS/TOR) pathway including vitellogenin (Vg), juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin-88 like peptides (ILPs), regulate important physiological processes in honey bees, including 89 behavioral division of labor [27-31]. Vg is a yolk protein highly expressed in the fat bodies [29], 90 secreted into the hemolymph and then imported by developing oocytes [32]. JH, one of the major 91 insect hormones, is synthesized in the corpora allata in a final reaction catabolized by the enzyme 92 methyl farnesoate epoxidase (MFE) [33]. There are two genes encoding insulin genes (ilp1 and 93 ilp2) in the honey bee genome [34], which are expressed in several tissues and organs including 94 the brain and fat bodies [27, 29, 30]. In workers, negative interactions among vg with JH and 95 insulin like peptides are associated with task performance: while vg levels are higher in nurses 96 compared with foragers [29, 35-37], JH titers [21, 36, 38, 39] brain ilp1 and fat body ilp2 mRNA 5 97 levels follow an opposite pattern [27, 29, 30]. Experimental manipulations showed that these 98 correlations reveal causative positive and negative interactions among these three regulatory 99 elements. Thus, JH treatments inhibit vg expression [35, 40], but induce higher brain ilp1 levels 100 [29] and precocious foraging [21, 41]. Consistently, experimental reduction of vg by RNA 101 interference also result in higher levels of JH [27] and precocious foraging [28]. 102 103 In recent years, the proposal that nutrition is an important factor regulating the division of labor 104 among social insects has received increased support [26, 30, 42-46]. Pollen consumption is low in 105 young bees, largest in about 9-day-old nurses and then declines to minimal amounts in foragers 106 [47], which rely primarily on honey intake. Cage experiments showed that 6-day-old workers 107 eating pollen and sugar have higher abdominal vg and low brain ilp1 levels, while same-age bees 108 fed with only sugar had the inverse pattern [30]; resembling the expression profiles observed in 109 colony-reared nurses and foragers, respectively [29]. The effect of pollen on behavioral 110 development could result from its protein content. In support of this view, it has been shown that 111 increased levels of hemolymph amino acids, induced by protein injection, resulted in high vg 112 mRNA levels and delayed foraging [27]. Additionally, lipid metabolism also has been involved 113 in nutritional regulation of division of labor. Lipid content closely correlates with task 114 performance, being higher in nurses compared to foragers [43]. Feeding of an inhibitor of fatty 115 acid synthesis (TOFA) induced precocious foraging [48], further supporting a role of lipids on 116 the regulation of division of labor. However, it remains to be tested whether supplementary lipids 117 (e.g., essential fatty acids) have an effect on the nutritional regulation of this process. 118 119 Since genes that regulate behavioral division of labor are nutritionally regulated, they could be 120 expected to be ideal biomarkers of both nutritional and behavioral state in cage as well as colony-121 level studies. Progressive evidence is revealing that behavioral and nutritional states influence 6 122 honey bee immunity and susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, the use of reliable markers for these 123 traits can also facilitate effective disease diagnosis. Indeed, the initial use of vg as a predictive 124 marker of colony losses [49] and colony nutritional state [14] provides a promising starting point 125 toward this direction. 126 127 Although insects lack an acquired immunity, they have developed an efficient innate immune 128 system against a broad variety of pathogens [50]. Innate immunity has been traditionally divided 129 into humoral and cellular responses, but there are complex interactions and no clearly defined 130 boundaries between both types of immune responses [51]. Four main gene pathways mediate 131 insect innate immunity: Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK/ STAT, which include elements implicated in 132 both the humoral and cellular immune responses and belong to gene families involved in 133 signaling, pathogen recognition and effector functions [52, 53]. 134 135 Humoral immune responses are mainly associated with antimicrobial effectors belonging to the 136 Toll pathway such as abaecin [54], defensin1 (def1) [55] and hymenoptaecin (hym) [56]. On the 137 other hand, cellular immunity is mediated by haemocytes and involves responses including 138 phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation [57] While phagocytosis is mediated by pathogen 139 recognition proteins (e.g., peptidoglycan recognition proteins L and S) [58] and transmembrane 140 proteins such as eater [59], nodulation and encapsulation are often accompanied by melanization, 141 a process catalyzed by the pro-phenoloxidase (PPO) and pro-phenoloxidase activator (PPOact) 142 enzymes [52, 60, 61]. 143 144 Different studies have revealed interactions among nutrition, immunity and physiological changes 145 associated with behavioral development. First, nutrition affects the expression of immune genes 146 [62-64] and susceptibility to different pathogens [65-68]. Second, infections of pathogens and 8 171 almost 3X higher when compared with P-UR colonies (100 and 35, respectively; P= <0.0001).
172 Analysis of nectar and pollen foragers in each nutritional group showed higher numbers of both 173 types of foragers in P-R compared with P-UR colonies (nectar: P-R=53, P-UR-24, P= <0.0001; 174 pollen: P-R=47, P-UR=11, P= <0.0001). While no significant differences were found between the 175 number of nectar and pollen foragers in P-R colonies (P=0.52), the difference between both types 176 of foragers in P-UR colonies was highly significant (P=0.0027) with a lower number of new 177 pollen foragers than nectar foragers under this condition ( Figure 1A and Figures S2 and S3 ). 178 179 2. Brood production.
180 Two days after the end of the behavioral observations, and one day after the last collection of 3-181 week-old workers, newly-emerged bees were counted on frames from P-R and P-UR colonies 182 until the last bees emerged after 16 days. The cumulative number of newly-emerged bees from P-183 R colonies was significantly lower compared to P-UR colonies (2573 and 3881, respectively. 184 P=0.014) (Figure 1B). 185 186 Figure 1. Effects of pollen restriction on foraging and brood production. Values were pooled 187 from eight pollen restricted (P-R) and eight pollen un-restricted colonies (P-U). The upper panel 188 (A) shows the effect of nutrition on the average number of new foragers per day. The y-axis 189 indicates the number of nectar foragers, pollen foragers and total foragers observed per day (sum 190 of 3 periods of 15 min each). Nutritional groups plotted in the x-axis are as follow: pollen-191 restricted colonies (R), pollen-unrestricted colonies (UR). The lower panel (B) compares the total 192 number of bees born (y-axis) from colonies in both nutritional conditions (x-axis). Error bars 193 represent SE across colonies. Significant differences in the total number of foragers between R 194 and UR colonies are represented with black stars. Differences in pollen or nectar foragers 195 between nutritional conditions are represented with blue stars. 196 197 198 199 200 9 201 3. Behavioral, nutritional and age analyses of gene expression and virus titers 202 Genes associated with physiological activity 203 204 Vg expression was significantly affected by behavior, with higher levels in nurses in all 205 nutritional and age groups (P= <0.0001 for all behavioral comparisons). Expression levels in 206 nurses were on average 3.75X higher compared with foragers. (Figure 2A) . Nutritional 207 treatments also had a significant effect on vg expression, with higher levels in nurses from 208 colonies with unrestricted access to pollen (P-UR) compared with nurses from colonies with 209 restricted access to pollen (P-R) in both age groups (2-week-old: P= <0.0001; 3-week-old: 210 P=0.0075). Foragers also showed higher levels of vg in P-UR colonies compared with P-R 211 colonies, but only at the younger group (P=0.0003). Lastly, age comparisons showed a 212 significant increase in 3-week-old workers in all the nutritional and behavioral comparisons with 213 the exception of foragers from P-UR colonies (Figure 2A and Table S2 ).
215 Mrjp1 expression levels were strongly affected by behavior with higher levels in nurses compared 216 with foragers in all the nutritional and age comparisons. On average, mrjp1 levels in nurses were 217 5X higher compared with foragers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons showed that pollen 218 consumption induced a significant increase of mrjp1 in younger nurses (P=0.009) and foragers 219 (7.2e-6) compared with workers from P-R colonies. No nutritional differences were observed in 220 older 3-week-old workers. Age comparisons showed a tendency toward higher levels in older 221 foragers, which become significant in all the comparisons with the exception of foragers from P-222 UR colonies. It is interesting to note, that our whole-body analyses reveal that mrjp1 mRNA 223 levels were substantially higher compared with vg, being on average over 500X higher ( Figure   224 2A). 225 10 226 Mfe expression showed behaviorally related changes in 2-week-old workers, with higher levels in 227 nurses compared with foragers (P-R= 0.015, P-UR=0.016). In contrast, no significant behavioral 228 differences were observed in 3-week-old workers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons 229 showed significantly higher mfe expression associated with pollen intake exclusively in 3-week-230 old workers (nurses: P=0.035, foragers: P=0.014). Lastly, age comparisons revealed a trend 231 toward down-regulation of mfe expression in older workers. However, significant differences 232 were only found in foragers from P-R colonies (P=0.002). ( Figure 2B ).
234 The expression of ilp1 revealed complex interactions in our behavioral and nutritional analyses.
235 The behavioral analysis showed significantly higher levels in younger foragers from P-UR 236 colonies (P=0.033) and in older nurses from P-R colonies (P=0.034). On the other hand, 237 nutritional comparisons exhibited higher levels in 2-week-old foragers from P-UR colonies and 238 3-week-old nurses from P-R colonies (2-week-old: nurses P=0.61, foragers P=0.014; 3-week-old 239 nurses P=0.01, foragers P=0.30). In contrast with behavior and nutritional analyses, age 240 comparisons revealed a significant down-regulation in the expression of ilp1 in most of the 241 nutritional and behavioral groups of older workers (P-R nurses: P=0.058, P-R foragers: P= 242 <0.0001, P-UR nurses: P= 0.0001, P-UR foragers: P= 0.0005) ( Figure 2B ).
244 Expression of ilp2 showed behavioral differences only in younger workers, with higher levels in 245 foragers both from P-R (P=0.0001) and P-UR (P=0.006) colonies. Nutritional comparisons 246 showed a trend toward higher ilp2 levels with pollen consumption in 2-week-old workers, but the 247 differences were marginally significant (P-R=0.08, P-UR=0.08) (Table S2 ). In contrast, higher 248 expression of ilp2 was associated with pollen restriction in both 3-week-old nurses (P=0.0001) 249 and foragers (P=0.037). Age comparisons revealed higher ilp2 expression in workers from 250 colonies experiencing pollen restriction (nurses P= <0.0001, foragers P=0.001). Additionally, our
7 147 parasites, such as the microsporidia Nosema ceranae, are associated with high JH and low vg 148 levels and precocious foraging [25] . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by 149 which colony nutritional conditions lead to changes in behavioral development, susceptibility to 150 pathogens and ultimately, colony survival.
152 In this study, we used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the nutritional stress 153 conditions occurring in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural areas. We used a new 154 technique for colony establishment, which allow us to uncouple the effects of age, behavior and 155 nutrition. We first analyzed the effect of pollen restriction on foraging and brood production and 156 then we used qPCR to analyze the role of pollen restriction on molecular markers of nutrition, 157 immune gene expression and dynamic of viral infection. Finally, we used a multidimensional 158 analysis to show that nutrition has a major role in the dynamics of key genes associated with 159 behavior, nutrition and immunity. This study opens new avenues in the understanding of the 168 Both groups of pollen-restricted (P-R) and pollen-unrestricted (P-UR) bees started foraging when 169 they were 11 days old. Observations were continued until the bees were 20 days old. During the 170 total observation period, the average number of new foragers observed in the P-R colonies was This article is a US Government work.

Overall behavioral analyses of these immune genes showed a strong trend 269 toward higher levels in foragers, reaching significant differences in 30 out of 36 comparisons 270 (83.3%). Remarkably, none of the comparisons showed higher expression levels of these genes in 271 nurses than in foragers. On the other hand, nutrition had a significant effect on the expression of 272 immune genes in 12 out 36 comparisons (33.3%). A higher percentage of comparisons showed 273 up-regulation associated with pollen ingestion (22%) than showed up-regulation associated with 274 pollen-restriction (11%). Lastly, age analysis of immune genes revealed significant differences in 275 20 out of 36 comparisons (55.5%). From these comparisons, 70% of them showed age-related 276 increased expression and 30% age-related down-regulation.

Conversely, the pathogen recognition protein pgrp-sc 281 was the immune gene less affected by behavior (50% of the four comparisons). The immune gene 282 most affected by nutrition was the regulatory gene dorsal (75%), while def1 was not affected by 283 nutrition. Dorsal also was the immune gene most influenced by age with a significant effect in 284 100% of the comparisons, followed by abaecin and ppo (75%). In contrast, eater and pgrp-sc 285 were the immune genes less affected by age (25% of the comparisons) (Figure 3 and 4, Table S2 ). Table S2 ). Overall 309 behavioral analysis of these viruses revealed significant differences in 50% of the comparisons.
310 From these comparisons, most of them were upregulated in foragers (83.3%) compared with 311 nurses (16.6%).

Nutritional comparisons revealed higher 317 titers of DWV only in younger nurses from P-UR colonies (P=0.0001), while no significant 318 differences were observed in other comparisons among nutritional, behavioral and age groups.
319 On the other hand, age comparisons showed a tendency toward lower levels in older workers, 320 with significant differences in nurses (P=<0.0001) and foragers (P=0.015) from P-UR colonies 321 ( Figure 5 , Table S2 ).
323 SBV titers showed behavioral differences in 2 out of 4 comparisons. In contrast with DWV, 324 higher levels in foragers were only observed in older workers from P-UR colonies (P=0.0035) 325 and younger nurses had higher titers in P-R colonies (P=0.035). Interestingly, pollen ingestion 326 was associated with higher SBV titers in younger foragers (P=0.011). On the other hand, age 327 comparisons showed higher titers in older foragers from P-R colonies (P=0.034) ( Figure 5 ). 328 329 Behavioral analyses of BQCV only showed significant effects in older workers from P-R 330 colonies, where foragers had higher titers than nurses (P=0.033). In contrast with the other two 331 viruses, younger nurses from P-R colonies had higher titers compared with foragers (P=0.0003).
332 Lastly, in contrast with DWV and SBV, no significant differences were observed in age 333 comparisons ( Figure 5 ). This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

We find a clear difference in the interactions of 367 immune genes with respect to nursing or foraging associated genes. Thus, the physiological genes 368 associated with nursing showed a strong trend toward negative correlations with immune genes; 369 with vg having 66.66% and 2.77% and mrjp1 72.22% and 0% significant negative and positive 388 between vg and SBV in workers from P-UR colonies in both age groups, the statistical This article is a US Government work.

In contrast, the genes associated with foraging showed in general a 391 positive association with virus levels, with 33.33% of positive correlations and 0% of negative 392 correlations. In particular, ilp2 showed a higher percentage of positive correlations with virus 393 (42.66%), followed by ilp1 (33.33%) and mfe (25%).

We complemented this 437 experimental model, by using triple TCSC for colony establishment, which allowed us to 438 uncouple the effects of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size, demography and 439 genetic background. This experimental setup also allowed us to explore the impact of these 440 variables on the expression of physiological genes involved in the nutritionally regulated division 441 of labor, immune genes and three major honey bee viruses. We showed that pollen deprivation 442 leads to a higher rate of new foragers, decreased brood production and caused important changes 443 in the expression of genes associated with physiological activity, immunity and titers of honey 444 bee viruses.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/667931 doi: bioRxiv preprint 506 We analyzed the expression of five nutritionally regulated genes associated with the 507 physiological behavioral state. This group of genes include two genes (vg and mrjp1) associated 508 with nursing physiological stage independently of nutritional condition and age, and three genes 509 (mfe, ilp1 and ilp2) whose expression is associated with foraging physiological state when 510 workers are not old or nutritionally stressed. 519 However, our study is the first to investigate the effect of pollen feeding in nurse and foragers at 520 different ages at the colony level. Our finding that nutrition influences vg expression in most 521 nutritional and age groups, with the exception of older foragers, has practical implications for the 522 use of vg as a nutritional biomarker in colony-level field studies. Our expression analysis revealed 523 a trend toward higher expression levels in older nurses irrespectively of nutritional conditions. 524 Although this result was unexpected, a recent study comparing young and old nurses and foragers 525 obtained similar results both measuring mRNA and proteins levels [80] . The biological meaning 526 of this phenomenon it is unknown, however, it is interesting to note that higher levels of Vg are 527 also found in long-lived winter bees [81] . All together, these results reveal a positive association 528 between Vg and longevity, which is compatible with its antioxidant properties [29, 82] .

First, we found highly significant 531 differences between nurses and foragers independently of nutritional condition and age. 532 Nurse/forager expression differences were especially large in younger 2-week old workers. This 533 expression pattern unveils mrjp1 as a reliable biomarker of behavior for whole body analyses. 534 Second, young nurses from pollen-restricted colonies had lower mrjp1 levels compared with 535 pollen-unrestricted colonies (P=0.02), but no significant differences between nutritional groups 536 were found in older nurses. Thus, in contrast with vg, the effect of pollen restriction was limited 537 to younger nurses. Third, foragers showed intriguing changes of mrjp1 expression associated with 538 nutrition and age. Younger 2-week-old foragers from colonies with high pollen storages (P-UR), 539 have higher mrjp1 levels compared with foragers from colonies with low pollen storage (P-R). 549 Still, these results suggest interesting possibilities for future studies. Royal jelly proteins secretion 550 from nurses' hypopharyngeal glands has been primarily associated with larval and queen feeding. 551 However, these proteins also are transferred during trophallaxis -mouth to mouth food transfer -552 preferentially to younger workers [86, 87] . Consistently, our results suggest that foragers could be 553 MRJPs donors during trophallactic interactions and that the potential for these interactions 554 increases with nutrition and age. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that the transfer of royal This article is a US Government work.

Although these studies have revealed the existence of differential tissue-specific 582 responses to nutritional inputs, few tissues and organs have been so far analyzed and it is 583 unknown the contribution of their expression relative to the whole body. Our analysis of ilp1 584 showed that this gene presented behavioral differences in 2-week-old workers from colonies with 585 unrestricted access to pollen, in which foragers had significantly higher levels compared with 586 nurses. Thus, ilp1 expression patterns in the whole-body followed a similar pattern to that 587 reported in isolated brains, but this similarly is restricted to young individuals of colonies not 588 experiencing nutritional stress. The magnitude of the difference between nurses and foragers for 589 the whole body is lower than that observed in brains [29, 30] . This result suggests that in young 590 nurses ilp1 expression is upregulated in other tissues when the colony is not nutritionally stressed. . On the other hand, given the expression differences yet existing between young 595 nurses and foragers from colonies not experiencing pollen deprivation, our results also suggest 596 that under this nutritional condition, ilp1 is predominantly higher expressed in forager's brain 597 compared with other tissues of nurses (e.g., fat body). In addition, nutritional comparison among 598 young foragers indicates that ilp1 expression is reduced by nutritional stress, possibly by 599 inhibiting ilp1 forager's brain expression. In contrast, in older nurses, nutritional stress is 600 associated with increased expression of ilp1. It remains to be addressed the contribution of the 601 brain and other tissues in this response. On the other hand, age comparisons revealed an 602 important age-dependent reduction in its expression in both nutritional conditions. Thus, ilp1 603 follow similar mRNA levels and expression pattern compared to mfe, but with some differences 604 in the strength of the effects of nutrition and age.

607 In contrast with ilp1, ilp2 showed higher levels in young foragers in both nutritional conditions. 608 Previous brain expression analyses revealed no behavioral differences in ilp2 expression [30] 609 suggesting that ilp2 expression in other young foragers' tissues could account for the observed 610 differences in this whole body analysis. On the other hand, similarly, to ilp1, significant 611 differences between nutritional groups were only observed in older workers. This article is a US Government work.

Thus, while the genes associated with nursing 830 showed a strong negative correlation with immune genes, the genes associated with foraging 831 displayed the opposite pattern (Figures 6 and 7 ).

Thus, it is either possible that the higher 854 expression of the immune genes observed in foragers can be a response to increased DWV 855 infection, or that this immune expression occurs before the increase in viral infection.

880 The analyses of three predominant honey bee viruses (DWV, BQCV and SBV) show that they 881 are affected to various degrees by honey bee behavior, nutrition and age. Our main results include 882 the demonstration of higher DWV levels in foragers and unexpectedly, the finding that pollen 883 ingestion is associated with higher DWV in young nurses. Higher DWV in foragers suggests that 884 accelerated behavioral development induced by nutritional stress could lead to amplified forager 885 mortality and further exacerbate changes in colony demography associated with colony collapse.
886 On the other hand, high DWV levels associated with pollen ingestion, suggest that in infected 887 colonies, nutritional resources further enhance the replication of this virus.
888 Our analyses of the correlations among the expression of immune genes and viral titers with 889 physiological genes associated with behavioral state revealed that the immune genes and DWV 890 exhibited strong negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive 891 correlations with genes associated with foraging ( Figure 8 ). These results emphasize the role of 892 nutrition on worker behavioral development and their consequences for honey bee immunity and 893 susceptibility to pathogenic infections. Finally, the results obtained by the NMDS analysis further 894 support the conclusion that behavioral state is the most important factor associated with the 895 expression of immune genes and viral titers. Overall, we provide important insights into the 896 mechanisms by which nutrition, behavior and age alter the expression of key genes involved in 897 the regulation of honey bee physiology and immunity, which are expected to contribute to a 898 better understanding of the effects of nutritional stress on colony health.
