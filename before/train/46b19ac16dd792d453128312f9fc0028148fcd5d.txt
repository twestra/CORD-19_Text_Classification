Spatial perception and actions rely on multiple spatial codes, often 17 associated with different reference frames. For instance, the accuracy of pointing 18 or reaching with an arm or finger to a visual target depends not only on the position 19 of target relative to gaze (Fiehler et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2014) , but also on 20 salient world-centered landmarks (Schütz et al., 2013) . Similarly, judgment of 21 visual location during whole-body movement is influenced by a target's position 22 relative to gaze, as well as by the location of the target relative to the body 23 (Tramper & Medendorp, 2015) . 24
In touch, too, space is coded in several reference frames. Touch activates 25 specialized sensory receptors embedded in the skin, and the arrangement of the 26 peripheral sensors is reflected in the homuncular organization of primary 27 somatosensory cortex (Penfield & Boldrey, 1937; Roux et al., 2018) , referred to as 28 a skin-based or somatotopic layout. However, because our body can take various 29 postures, the stimulus location in space -often referred to as its external location 30 -must be derived by combining skin location and body posture, a process termed 31 tactile remapping (Heed, Buchholz, et al., 2015) . Indeed, there is evidence that 32 external tactile locations can be coded in a gaze-centered reference frame ( For touch, it has been suggested that the construction of spatial location is 49 an automatic process, implying that any tactile input is remapped into an external 50 code, irrespective of its relevance (Heed & Azañón, 2014; Röder et al., 2004) . The 51 most common experimental manipulation underlying this claim is limb crossing. 52
Crossing, say, a right arm over to the left side of space leads to different skin-53 based (here: right body side) and external (here: left side of space) spatial codes 54 of a tactile stimulus delivered to the right hand. A task-irrelevant tactile stimulus 55 delivered to a crossed right hand accelerates visual discrimination in the right 56 visual field if it precedes the visual target stimulus by 60 ms, but on the left side if 57 it leads by 180 ms or more (Azañón et al., 2010; Azañón & Soto-Faraco, 2008) . 58
Thus, responses to visual targets were faster after anatomically congruent tactile 59 cues (e.g., tactile stimulus on [crossed] right hand, visual target in right hemifield) 60 at short cue-stimulus intervals, but after externally congruent tactile cues (e.g., 61
tactile stimulus on the left hand crossed over to the right side, visual target in right 62 field) at long cue-stimulus intervals. Such effects are usually interpreted as 63 evidence that tactile remapping -the precise computation of the external tactile 64 confusion is much more prominent when the arms are in a crossed than uncrossed 73 posture. This is surprising because the TOJ task asks about the identity of the 74 touched limb, and, in theory, it would be irrelevant to this question where the hand 75 was in space. That limb crossing, nevertheless, affects TOJ implies that posture 76 cannot be strategically ignored, but is automatically incorporated into the hand 77 assignment. 78
Several explanations have been put forward to account for crossing effects 79 in tactile localization. First, it has been suggested that touch location, once it is 80 remapped, is retained only in an external spatial code, and the original skin location 81 is discarded in the process. To report which body part has been touched, the brain 82 must then reversely determine which limb was located at the computed external 83 location at the time of the touch (Kitazawa, 2002; Kitazawa et al., 2008; Yamamoto 84 & Kitazawa, 2001) . We refer to this suggestion as the space-to-limb reconstruction 85 hypothesis. When applied to errors in the TOJ task, this hypothesis implies that 86 participants correctly remap the two tactile stimuli into external space, but then 87 reconstruct erroneously which hand was at the first spatial location. 88
A second explanation assumes that TOJ errors reflect the conflict between 89 different codes used for stimulus location. When the limbs are crossed, skin-based 90 and external spatial codes point to different sides of space, and this conflict must 91 be resolved, a process that takes time and is error-prone (Röder, Kusmierek, 92 Spence, & Schicke, 2007; Simon, Hinrichs, & Craft, 1970) . In this view, the TOJ 93 crossing effect is a marker for the presence of conflict and, thus, for the fact that 94 remapping into an external spatial code has taken place. Notably, the interpretation 95 that the TOJ crossing effect derives from a remapped stimulus location is indirect 96 because participants only report a binary decision about which hand was 97 stimulated, not the spatial location of the perceived stimulus. Increasing the 98 distance between the uncrossed hands can slightly reduce errors in TOJ ( 
Participants assumed a start posture with their hands resting on a table and 169 their arms stretched out in an uncrossed or crossed posture (see Fig. 2 for an 170 illustration of experimental conditions and trial timing). A tone then instructed a 171 movement of the two hands about 30 cm towards their body, bringing the arms 172 .

The response, thus, contained two 186 components: the hand to which the first stimulus was assigned, and explicit spatial 187 localization of this stimulus. 188
We measured TOJ performance as the percentage of correct reports of 190 which hand had been stimulated first in the TOJ task, as indicated by the hand that 191 .

In sum, TOJ performance in our first experiment reflected known 232 modulations of hand posture and movement timing. Participants made, on 233 average, more than 15% TOJ errors even with uncrossed hands. This high error 234 rate is due to the use of the short SOA of 110 ms ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Having established that participants appear to have perceived the stimulus 259 at the reporting hand, two possibilities remain as to which stimulus location was 260 associated with erroneous responses (see Fig. 1 ). The stimulus switch hypothesis 261 posits that the two stimuli were localized correctly, and one is chosen for the 262 response. In TOJ error trials, participants would confuse the two stimuli and report 263 the second stimulus by pointing at its location with the respective, incorrect hand.

Such movement time-related biases were evident also in the present data 295 (see Fig. 5 ). In the case of correct TOJ trials, we assume that participants aimed, 296 as instructed, at the location of the correct hand at time 1. Therefore, we derive the 297 localization error curve as the spatial difference of reaching endpoint and hand 298 location at time 1 (see Fig. 6 , dark blue lines). However, we can also derive a 299 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

To quantify this further, we computed by 317 how much reaching endpoints of TOJ error trials had to be shifted to best match 318 either template curve derived from correct TOJ trials. If, in incorrect TOJ trials, 319 participants aimed for the incorrect hand's position at time 1, then the temporal 320 shift should be zero relative to the localization error curve in correct TOJ trials 321 relative to time 1; furthermore, it should be about -110 ms (negative denoting a 322 shift towards left, see above) compared to the localization error curve of correct 323 TOJ trials relative to time 2. If, however, participants aimed for the incorrect hand's 324 position at time 2, the shift pattern should be exactly reverse, that is, zero 325 compared to the second template curve, and near +110 ms compared to the first 326 template curve.

The pattern of hand assignment errors was in line with previous studies: 508
Participants made more TOJ hand assignment errors in conditions that involved 509 hand crossing than in conditions in which the hands were uncrossed (see Fig. 3 Azañón, 2014). In contrast, localization error patterns were similar across 516 uncrossed and crossed start and end hand posture conditions, suggesting that arm 517 posture during stimulation did not affect reach-to-point localization (see Fig. 4, 5) . 518
In particular, localization errors exhibited comparable spatial biases over time in 519 uncrossed and crossed conditions. Furthermore, localization error scattered 520 around the chosen hand was not biased towards the other hand (see Fig. 4 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/549832 doi: bioRxiv preprint incorrect limb choice, in contrast, implies that not stimulus location determines 533 hand choice, but vice versa, hand choice determines perceived stimulus location. 534
In turn, this conclusion is incompatible with the common view that crossing 535 effects, obtained in experiments that require categorical decisions such as TOJ, 536
are an implicit indicator of precise tactile localization and, thus, tactile remapping. 537 This is a seemingly surprising conclusion given that limb crossing quite obviously 538 creates conflict between the anatomical body side and the side of space, and it is 539 a strong claim that seems to invalidate the experimental logic of numerous papers 540 that have applied this logic. Our conclusion is, however, in fact compatible with 541 that of another recent study in which participants performed TOJ of tactile stimuli 542 presented to the hands and feet (Badde et al., 2019) . In that study, stimuli were 543 presented to two of the four limbs (hands and feet), but it was unknown to the 544 participant which two limbs would be stimulated in a given trial. Accordingly, four 545 rather than just two response options were always available. In a percentage of 546 trials, participants systematically assigned the first touch to a limb that had not 547 received a tactile stimulus at all during the respective trial. For instance, after 548 stimulation of the left hand and the right foot, a participant may have indicated that 549 the first stimulus had occurred on the right hand. These errors depended on 550 whether the arms and/or legs were crossed. Importantly, neither the side of space 551 of the limb that had received the correct stimulus, nor the spatial distance between 552 stimulus and response limb, were indicative of the erroneously chosen, 553 unstimulated limb -again incompatible with the prevailing view that crossing 554 effects reflect conflict during the integration of anatomical and spatial stimulus 555 location. Instead, participants responded with unstimulated limbs that occupied the 556 space anywhere around the body side of the correct, first tactile stimulus, 557 independent of whether that limb was crossed or not. Thus, what mattered for limb 558 assignment was not the precise, spatial location of the stimulus, but much broader, 559 global spatial stimulus features such as an entire side of the body and its 560 surrounding space. Critically, these global features explained behavior without 561 .

Notably, other manipulations that have been used to argue for the relevance 564 of precise spatial representations in tactile decisions can be framed in such a 565 feature-based account as well. For instance, the TOJ crossing effect was reduced 566 when the two hands' positions differed in height or in depth (Azañón et al., 2016) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/549832 doi: bioRxiv preprint Furthermore, our proposal contrasts with the suggestion that TOJ errors are 591 due to temporal confusion of the two stimuli, hypothesized to occur due to slowing 592 of a neural clock mechanism because crossed postures induce higher cognitive 593 load as compared to uncrossed postures (Kitazawa et al., 2008) . This hypothesis 594 is based on the assumption that tactile locations are represented correctly but 595 ordered incorrectly in time.

We calculated the localization error, that is, the difference 708 between the true location of the index finger at the time of stimulation and the 709 reported location, that is, index finger pointing location just before finger lifting.

Specifically, we shifted the data points of the incorrect TOJ localization curves in 730 time from 300 -300 ms in steps of 1 ms and calculated the squared localization 731 error differences with an localization curve calculated from data points of the two 732 compared conditions using a common moving Gaussian average for each time 733

Models that tested time 756 The brms R package uses STAN as backend. We ran LMM to estimate the 763 95% interval of the intercepts in the different time shift models. We compared 764
Bayesian models using the loo_compare() function of the loo R package. This 765 function uses leave-one-out cross-validation to compare models by assessing the 766 models' predictive density when each data point is omitted from fitting (Vehtari et 767 al., 2017) . 768
Apparatus, task and procedure 770
Kinematic data of the fingers was recorded using an optical motion capture system 771 (Visualeyez II VZ4000v, Phoenix Technologies Inc, Vancouver, BC, Canada) at 772 250Hz sampling frequency with markers placed on the nail of the two index fingers. 773
The experiment was controlled with Matlab (The MathWorks Version R2015a; 774 Natick, MA, USA) using the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) . Stimulus 775 presentation was controlled via custom-made hardware and triggered through a 776 digital acquisition card (PCI-6509, National Instruments, Austin, USA). 777
The procedure was largely similar to Experiment 1, except that 1) participants 778 made only reaches from an uncrossed to an uncrossed posture or from a crossed 779 to a crossed posture and 2) tactile stimuli were separated by SOAs of 60, 85, 110, 780 or 135 ms. Posture was varied in blocks of 64 trials in a pseudo-randomized order. 781
Within each block, SOA and which hand was stimulated first were pseudo-782 randomized. Participants performed 28 blocks (14 of each posture combination) 783 for a total of 1792 trials.

As we stopped any form of data acquisition in our lab for an 786 indefinite time period beginning of March 2020, 2 participants performed only 19 787 and 23 blocks, respectively. The experiment took about 5-6 hours to complete, 788 split in two-hour sessions held on different days. Practice trials were included prior 789 to each experimental session. 790
Data preprocessing. We used custom-written Matlab scripts for processing of 792 kinematic data. We first interpolated missing data points and resampled the data 793 to 1000 Hz using splines, and low-pass filtered the data using a second-order 794 butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 6 Hz. We determined movement onset/ 795 offset of each hand as the time of the sample in which the resultant velocity of the 796 respective finger marker exceeded/ dropped below 5 cm/s. We excluded trials 797 when missing marker data could not be adequadetely interpolated (8 %), when no 798 stimulus localization response, indicated by finger lifting, could be detected (4.2 799 %), and when participants did not perform smooth, continuous, and synchronous 800 movements (6.8 %). In total we removed 18.2 % of the trials. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
