26 The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its 27 control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its 28 classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now 29 recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical 30 consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common 31 origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two 32 genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population 33 dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A 34 collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences 35 of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected 36 in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results 37 demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist 38 until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the 39 main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely 40 through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated 41 in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains 42 originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to 43 Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy.
44 Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate 45 from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and 46 sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be 47 shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general. Introduction 52 Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is currently classified in the species Avian coronavirus, genus 53 Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. The viral genome is about 27 Kb 54 long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 55 numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid 56 structural proteins [1]. IBV currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry 57 farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, 58 particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections [2]. Similarly to other 59 RNA viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the 60 rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity [3]. 61 The Spike protein, further processed in the S1 and S2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral 62 protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. Besides being involved in 63 viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing 64 immune response [1,4]. Its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one 65 being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes [5], which severely 66 hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. Additionally, the genetic variability 67 has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes 68 based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. Although it 69 could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding 70 or confusing the proper understanding of IBV molecular epidemiology. 71 Only in 2016, in the framework of COST Action FA1207, a coherent and common IBV genotype 72 classification was proposed [6], grouping the identified strains in 6 genotypes and 32 lineages.
73 Interestingly, Valastro et al., (2016), confirmed what previously proposed by Franzo et al., [7] about 74 the clustering of 624/I and Q1 genotypes in the same group (currently named GI-16).
75 Until then, the two genotypes had been named (and considered) independent: the 624/I was first 76 reported in Italy in 1993 [8], and thereafter in Slovenia [9], Poland [10], and Russia [11]. Moreover, doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 77 retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in Italy since the early 1960s [12], where it 78 remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. However, from the 1990s, its 79 detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. At the same time, in 1996, a new virus (later 80 renamed Q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis [13] in China and thereafter in 81 other Asian [14,15], Middle Eastern [16,17], South American [18,19] and European countries 82 [7,20-22]. Remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spreading 83 from Asia was supposed, similarly to what proven for the GI-19 lineage (QX genotype) [23]. The 84 insight provided by recent genetic studies [6,7] raised new questions about the history, 85 epidemiology and spreading of the GI-16 lineage around the world. The knowledge of these 86 processes would be of interest not only for the particular case under investigation, but could also 87 provide useful information on the general intra-and inter-continents viral dispersion patterns, aiding 88 the development and implementation of adequate control measures. 89 Unfortunately, the paucity of sequences available before Q1 detection in China prevented this 90 investigation for a long time. In the present study, a high number of retrospective GI-16 sequences 91 were generated from Italian samples collected since 1963 and analyzed together with the worldwide 92 available ones using a phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the history of this genotype and infer 93 its spreading pattern around the world. 94 95 Material and Methods 96 Italian strain detection and sequencing 97 IBV samples collected between 1963-2017 were included in the study. Italian sequences were 98 obtained during the routine diagnostic activity of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della 99 Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna.

The sequencing of 104 samples collected before 2009 was performed on the isolates whereas the sequencing of those 105 collected after 2009 was directly carried outon the submitted tissues. .
106 . Viral RNA was extracted from isolates using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 107 according to the manufacturer's protocol. IBV was detected using RT-PCR as previously described 108 [23]. Partial sequencing of the S1 gene (464-bp), covering the hypervariable region 3 (HVR3), was 109 performed using the same primers that were used for RT-PCR. The obtained chromatogram quality 110 was evaluated by FinchTV (http://www.geospiza.com) and the consensus sequences were 111 reconstructed using CromasPro (CromasPro Version 1.5). 112 113 International database preparation 114 To download all available IBV sequences overlapping with the region of interest (HVR3), one of 115 the Italian sequences was used as query in BLAST and all sequences with a genetic distance lower 116 than 30% were downloaded. Obtained sequences plus the Italian ones were merged with the 117 reference set provided by Valastro et al., [6] and aligned using MAFFT [24]. Partial sequences (i.e. 118 covering only part of the HVR3) and those with unknown nucleotides, frameshift mutations and 119 premature stop codons, suggestive of poor sequence quality, were removed from the dataset.
120 A phylogenetic tree was then reconstructed using PhyML [25] selecting as the most appropriate 121 substitution model the one with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) calculated using 122 Jmodeltest [26]. The phylogenetic tree was used to classify the strains and those 123 potentially belonging to the GI-16 lineage were extracted. The presence of 124 recombinant strains was evaluated using RDP4 [27] on a dataset including the selected GI-16 like 125 strains plus the reference ones. The RDP4 settings for each method were adjusted accounting for the 126 dataset features according to the RDP manual recommendations. Only recombination events

After recombinant removal, the absence of residual 129 breakpoints was confirmed with SBP implemented in HyPhy [28]. Only sequences with collection 130 date and country were included in the study. Dedicated Python scripts were used to extract this 131 information from the Genbank file or, if absent, original publications were consulted and the 132 sequences were re-named accordingly. Finally, TempEst [29] was used to investigate the 'temporal 133 signal' of the heterochronous sequences under investigation and the sequences whose sampling date 134 was inconsistent with their genetic divergence and phylogenetic position were removed. Indeed, 135 significant deviations from the expectation can be due to several factors including low sequencing 136 quality, excessive passaging leading to the accumulation of cell-line adaptations, recombination, 137 etc. [29]. Xia test was performed for each codon position to exclude the presence of codon 138 saturation. 139 140 Phylodynamic analysis 141 Since there was a clear bias in the number of sequences collected in each county and in different 142 time periods, the original dataset was split in ten randomly generated databases in order to diminish 143 this bias impact and evaluate the robustness of achieved results over several independent runs [30]. 144 More specifically, a maximum of 5 sequences for each country-year pair were randomly selected 145 and included in the study. For each dataset the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA), 146 the evolutionary rates (substitutions/sites/year) and population dynamics (expressed as Effective 147 population size (Ne)•generation time (t), also called relative genetic diversity) were jointly 148 estimated in a Bayesian fashion using the serial coalescent approach implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 149 [31]. Additionally, the discrete state phylogeographic approach implemented in the same program 150 was used to reconstruct the viral spreading pattern, assuming each collection country as a strain 151 feature [32]. This method allows to estimate the location and time of ancestral strains, calibrated 152 using the implemented molecular clock and population model. Above all, the Bayesian approach 153 allows to account for all the other parameter and phylogenetic uncertainness. Additionally, the use . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

In the latter phase, two main peaks in the mean Ne•t value were consistently 208 predicted around ~1985 and ~2005-2008. An additional minor rise was detected after 2010.
209 Nevertheless, the variation in the population size slightly differed among runs and, more generally, 210 the 95HPD intervals were generally broad over the whole considered period. 211 212 Figure 2.

The results of the ten independent runs have 214 been color-coded. Lower Figure: Mean, median and upper and lower 95HPD values are reported for 215 each run. 216 217 Phylogeographic analyses provided substantially constant results independently from the randomly 218 generated database. Well supported migration rates were identified both among different continents, 219 linking Asia with Europe, Middle East and South America, and within these regions, particularly in 220 Asia and South America (Figure 3). 221 222 Figure 3.

Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were constructed and annotated using 168 Treeannotator. SpreaD3 [36] was used to summarize and display phylogeographic results and to 169 calculate the BF of different between-countries migration rates. The transmission rate was 170 considered statistically significant (i.e. non-zero) when the BF was higher than 3 [32].
Hypervariable region 1-2 (HVR12) 173 Unfortunately, no strict guidelines currently exist on IBV sequencing protocols. Consequently, 174 despite the HVR3 of the S1 gene is the most commonly sequenced region, different research groups 175 have produced and published sequences obtained from other Spike protein portions. To benefit from 176 these sequences, some representative of additional countries, a second dataset based on the HVR1 177 and 2 (HVR12) was created and analyzed using the same approach previously described. However, 178 because of the limited sequence number and more balanced origin, a unique analysis was 179 performed, avoiding the multiple dataset generation step. Table) . TempEst analysis demonstrated the 187 presence of a significant temporal structure, being the correlation between genetic distances and 188 sampling dates equal to 0.54 (R 2 = 0.29; slope 7.77x10 -4 ).
189 The final HVR12 dataset included sequences 76 sequences collected from 12 countries (S1 Table) .

Nevertheless, the lower sequence 284 number and shorter time window covered by HVR12 database pose in favor of the HVR3 based 285 analysis reliability. Anyhow, these results testify the long lasting undetected circulation of this 286 genotype in Italy. The absence of adequate monitoring and diagnostic tools at that time clearly 287 justifies this evidence, which could be realistically extended to most of current IBV genotypes.
288 Unfortunately, the lack of sequences relative to the period before 1963 prevents the precise 289 reconstruction of viral population dynamics in this time frame. However, the skyline profile, 290 especially from the '60s onward, when actual data became available, shows that GI-16 was able to 291 circulate and persist in Italy at low level until the '80s, when a remarkable increase in relative 390 genetic approach will be useful to elucidate the actual influence of these residues on GI-16 391 virulence.
394 Overall, the present study reconstructs the history and spreading dynamics of the GI-16 lineage 395 from its origin to nowadays, demonstrating the complex network leading to its dispersal in Europe, 396 Asia and South America. Above all, the ancient history of a previously considered "emerging" 397 genotype is described and testifies the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified 398 nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming 399 appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV 400 genotypes and pathogens in general.
