Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories although 37 how they assemble remains unknown. 38
During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by 39 the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this post-translational 40 modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on the virus replication 41 remains obscure. Here we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by 42 taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse genetics system. An NSP5 43 trans-complementing cell line was used to generate and characterise several 44 recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that a 45 rRV lacking NSP5, was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to 46 replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. 47
A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to 48 further interrogate the function of this post-translational modification in the 49 assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant 50 strains exhibit impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped 51 viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism of 52 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-53 negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines 54 expressing either wt NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results 55 indicate that NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of 56 round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 57 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 58 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional 59 viral factories in other RNA viruses. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

The non-structural 69 protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during 70 RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. 71 However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been 72 directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse genetics (RG) 73 system for rotaviruses. Here we show a novel application of a recently developed 74 RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell 75 line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach 76 allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein 77 during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants we shed light 78 on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and 79 its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent 80 viroplasms. 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97

Newly synthesized RNAs were labeled by including 2 mM 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) 302 into the cell culture medium, and modified incorporated nucleotides were reacted 303 with an azide-conjugated fluorophore Alexa-488 following the manufacturer's 304 protocol for Click-iT RNA Alexa Fluor 488 imaging kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 305
Cell nuclei were stained with ProLong™ Diamond Antifade Mountant with 4',6-306 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Scientific). Samples were imaged using 307 a confocal setup (Zeiss Airyscan equipped with a 63x, NA=1.3 objective), and the 308 images were processed using ZEN lite software. 309 11 nuclease-free Dulbecco's phosphate saline buffer (DPBS) for 10 min at room 313 temperature. Samples were washed twice with DPBS, and then permeabilized 314 with 70% (v/v) ethanol in RNAse-free water at +4 o C for at least 1 hour prior to 315 hybridization. Permeabilized samples were re-hydrated for 5 min in a pre-316 hybridization buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0 in nuclease-317 free water, 10 % v/v formamide, supplemented with 2 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside 318 complex). Re-hydrated samples were hybridized with 62.5 nM of an equimolar 319 mixture of Cy3-labelled DNA probes designed to target the coding region of the 320 gene segment 6 of simian rotavirus A/SA11 (Genbank Acc.

To rescue the NSP5/KO strain, a stop codon at position 18Y was introduced ( complementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 2C ). Together, these data confirm that 420 NSP5 is essential for RV replication. 421 422 rRVs with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation 423
To address the role of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation, we then generated a number 424 of rRVs harbouring NSP5 mutations previously known to impact NSP5 425 phosphorylation. We first generated an rRV carrying an S67A mutation (rRV-426 NSP5/S67A) ( Table 1 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-EGFP fusion proteins were also 466 recruited to both types of these structures (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that the observed 467 lack of phosphorylation does not affect NSP2/NSP5 interactions. Furthermore, 468 the NSP5/S67A mutant and additional viroplasmic proteins NSP2, VP6 and VP2 469 with rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant (Fig. 7A, left panel) . Furthermore, the observed 522 immature viroplasms also appeared to be less-electron dense, likely due to their 523 .

Together, these data strongly support the role of NSP5 phosphorylation in 526 maintaining the viral RNA production and genome replication in viroplasms. 527
The mechanism of NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation 529
We have previously proposed a model of the hierarchical NSP5 530 hyperphosphorylation associated with the assembly of viroplasms that involves a 531 three-step mechanism: i) initial interaction of non-phosphorylated NSP5 with 532 NSP2 (or VP2); ii) phosphorylation of Ser67 by CK1. This step does not take 533 place when NSP5 is expressed alone; iii) hyper-phosphorylation of NSP5 534 triggered by Ser67 phosphorylation that requires the 18 AA long C-terminal tail 535 (24). 536
Here, we have investigated the phosphorylation mechanism of NSP5 during RV 537 infection using a number of NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains and 538 MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines (Table 1) . We demonstrated that 539 despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/T was not phosphorylated 540 and failed to form viroplasms. We have previously shown that co-expression of 541 NSP5/T was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, 542 while other NSP5 mutants referred hereafter as activators of phosphorylation, 543 e.g., NSP5/3 did (24). Interestingly, upon co-infection with two rRVs 544 NSP5/S67A and NSP5/T, both mutated NSP5 variants were not phosphorylated 545 (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3-4) . The NSP5-176-180 mutant 548 was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following the co-549 infection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail. 550
This result suggests that the 'activator' NSP5 needs to be also hyper-551 phosphorylated (Fig. 8C) . replicate and also showed spherical structures that contained NSP5 and NSP2, 582 but not VP6 (Fig. 10A-C) . Of the two non-structural proteins involved in viroplasm assembly, NSP5 appears 601 to play a crucial role by potentially providing a scaffold that allows for recruitment 602 of additional viral proteins. Only when NSP5 is co-expressed with NSP2 and/or 603 VP2, these proteins assemble into the viroplasm-like structures (VLS), which are 604 also capable to recruit additional structural proteins including VP1, VP2 and VP6 605 (8, 10). Given these observations, we hypothesised that complete removal of 606 NSP5 would be lethal for RV replication. Using a modified reverse genetics Using the NSP5 mutant strains described above and the established stable 673 transfectant MA104 cells we were able to investigate the molecular mechanism 674 that leads to NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. We showed that the NSP5/S67A 675 mutant from the rRV was indeed hyperphosphorylated, albeit not completely, 676 .

The hierarchical phosphorylation of proteins appears to be a common 708 mechanism regulating many cellular processes.
