1 transmission routes 2 Sk Shahid Nadim a , Indrajit Ghosh 1a , Joydev Chattopadhyay a 3 Abstract 5
In this paper, we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths: direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R 0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R 0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication. 7 12 directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly through a vector. Understanding the transmission 13 dynamics of such diseases is of utmost interest. Mathematical models of epidemic diseases have been 14 very insightful in uncovering epidemiology and transmission patterns of the diseases. It is very important 15 to understand such epidemic patterns for better public health interventions and control of outbreaks. 16 Another important objective of these models is to inform public health organizations about the effect of 17 control policies on a certain population. However, hosts behaviour and psychological factors are some-18 times the main drivers of further transmission of the disease. For example, the epidemic outbreak of 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3; 4) had such psychological effects and individual protection 20 1 doi: bioRxiv preprint 32 However, the dynamics of an epidemic model with two transmission routes where the direct trans-33 mission incorporates psychological effect has not been studied so far. The ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic 34 and zika virus epidemic are examples of diseases with two routes of transmission having psychological 35 effects. The psychosocial implication on the disease outbreak is more dangerous than any other phys-36 ical effect. West Nile Virus outbreak in the US is a good example for the onset of psychogenic illness 37 (10) and may generate mistrust towards national or health authorities. For example, the mild effects 38 of Zika virus, there is a correlation between psychosis with fetus microcephaly where pregnant women 39
and their relatives are highly sensitive group. Therefore, there is a negative correlation between the 40 psychological effect and disease prevalence and hence we consider non-monotone incidence function i.e 41 p < q to describe the direct transmission between hosts in our study. This type of function can be used 42 to interpret the "psychological effects" (11). We use the incidence rate g(I)S = βIS 1+αI 2 where βI repre-43 sent the force of infection of the diseases, 1 1+αI 2 represent the psychological effect from the behavioral 44 changes of susceptible population when the number of infected populations increases. Our goal is to 45 develop a simple mathematical model that capture a range of disease dynamics with multiple mode of 46 transmissions. Moreover, we would like to perform a detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of the 47 proposed model. By using analytical methods we intend to uncover the dynamical properties of the 48 diseases with two routes of transmission.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 consist of the model formulation and the 50 basic assumptions. In Section 3, preliminary mathematical analysis of the proposed model is carried out.
Section 4 is devoted to the global stability of the endemic equilibrium using geometric approach while 52 in Section 5 backward bifurcation and forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect is presented. In Section 53 6 we investigate some numerical scenarios such as effect of temporary control on bistable dynamics, 54 effect of the strength of psychological fear and impact of heterogeneity in indirect transmission. Finally, 55 discussion and conclusion is presented in Section 7. 56 2. Model formulation 57 We consider two population groups as host and vector population. Time-dependent state variables 58 are taken to describe the compartments of the two populations. Let at time t, N h (t) represents total 59 host population and N v (t) represents total vector population. We consider a 'SIR' type model for the 60 host population and a 'SI' type model for the vectors. The host population is subdivided into three 61 mutually disjoint classes: susceptible, S h ; infected, I h ; recovered, R h . Thus, at any time t, the size of 62 the host population is given by N h = S h + I h + R h . The vector population consist of two classes namely, 63 susceptible vectors, S v ; and infected vectors, I v . With this division, the size of the vector population 64 2 . CC-BY 4.0 The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the number of secondary infections which one infected indi-102 vidual would produce in a entirely susceptible population. The disease free equilibrium (DFE) of the 103 system is given by Y 0 = ( Π h µ h , 0, 0, Πv µv , 0). There are two infected compartments in the model (2.1), I h 104
and I v . R 0 can be derived from the jacobian matrix of the system (2.1) calculated at Y 0 together with 105 the assumption of local asymptotic stability of Y 0 and is given by
The mode of transmission of some infectious diseases may be through both direct and indirect con-9 tact. In direct transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through infected host, and in 10 indirect transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through an infected vector. For instance, 11 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (1) and Zika virus (2) may be spread both policies have been found very effective (5; 6) in decreasing the rate of infection at the late stage of SARS outbreak, even when the number of infective individuals were getting larger relatively. Additionally, the influenza pandemic of 2009 has triggered a psychological effect that caused adoption of preventive 23 measures by a significant portion of the population (4). Recent MERS-CoV outbreak in Arabian penin-24 sula also imposed a significant behaviour change in the local people (1) . Thus, psychological effects 25 are necessary in modelling infectious disease transmission. The general incidence rate in this context at time t is given by N v (t) = S v (t) + I v (t). We assume all newborn hosts are fully susceptible. The susceptible host population increases at a constant rate Π h . The susceptible population decreases due to 66 getting infection from infected vectors and infected hosts and natural mortality at a rate µ h . Therefore 
Interpretations of all the model parameters and their biological meanings are given in the Table 1 . We assume that the vector and host state variables are non-negative for all t ≥ 0. Let
We claim the following result.
Theorem 3.1. Whenever the initial conditions are non-negative, model (2.1) has non-negative solutions and the region Ω ∈ R 5 + is positively invariant and globally attracting for the above system. 84 Proof. We can rewrite the system (2.1) in the following form 85 86 dy dt = g(y) (3. 1) with y = (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 , y 5 ) = (S h , I h , R h , S v , I v ) and g(y) = (g 1 (y), g 2 (y), g 3 (y), g 4 (y), g 5 (y)) denote the 87 right hand side of the functions as in the following 88 89
Clearly, for every j = 1, ..., 5, g j (x) ≥ 0 if y ∈ R 5 + and y j = 0. Since the host and vector populations 90 are non-negative, thus the right hand side of the system (3.1) is locally Lipschitz in Ω. Following (12) 91 and (13), we see that the system (2.1) has a unique solution. The following equations are satisfied by 92 the total host and vector populations, if R 0 > 1.
Proof. The Jacobian of the system (2.1) at DFE Y 0 is given as follows
(3.5)
Then the characteristic equation of (3.5) is given by
The eigenvalues of this jacobian matrix is 
Note that λ is the EGR for the 'SIR' sub-model of the system (2.1) and is given by
If there is no indirect transmission through vector(β i → 0), then the system (2.1) becomes the 129 sub-model (3.8) and λ → λ. Additionally, from (3.6), it can be noted that
The mean time spent in the infected host class is dependent on the host lifetime, the mean infectious 137 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/486720 doi: bioRxiv preprint

Provided, the observed growth rate λ obs is equal to the EGR λ for the 'SIRSI' model (2.1). Since 
Proposition 2. Let R 0 > 1 and R 0 is fixed for system (2.1). Let dλ dβ i denote the total derivative of λ 159 with respect to β i . Then dλ dβ i < 0.
Proof. The EGR λ is explicitly dependent on both β i and β d . From the analytical expression of R 0 , β d 161 can be determined in terms of β i as,
(3.7) is involved in the expression of R SIRSI 0 given by (3.10). We will calculate the total derivative of λ:
Since R 0 is fixed and using (3.13), the total derivative of (3.10) gives
(3.14)
(3.15)
We have R 0 > 1, λ ≥ λ and λ > 0. Finally, µ v > 0. Thus, the numerator become positive and the 165 denominator is negative in (3.15), giving that dλ dβ i < 0.
Now we calculate the relationship of dλ dβ i with ∂λ ∂β i and ∂λ ∂β d as follows:
Corollary 3.1. Let R 0 > 1 and the initial EGR λ be given by (3.6).
To verify this result numerically, sensitivity index of λ with respect to the parameters β d and β i 169 are computed. The normalized forward sensitivity index of a quantity with respect to a parameter 170 is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter.
Mathematically, the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable m that depends explicitly on a 172 parameter τ is defined as:
The normalized forward sensitivity indices of λ with respect to the parameters β d and β i are found to
for the parameters value Π h = 5,
The fact that X β d λ = 1.6631 means that 1% increase in β d , keeping other parameters fixed, will produce In this section we discuss the existence of endemic equilibria and its stability conditions. Let

The system (2.1) has unique endemic equilibrium Y * if R 0 > 1 and cases 1, 2, 6 and 10 202 in Table 2 are satisfied, and has unique endemic equilibrium Y * if R 0 < 1 and cases 3, 4, 5 and 14 in 203   Table 3 are satisfied. The system (2.1) could have more than one endemic equilibrium if R 0 > 1 and 204 cases 3 − −5, 7 − −9, 11 − −13, 15 and 16 in Table 2 are satisfied, and could have more than one endemic 205 equilibrium if R 0 < 1 and cases 2, 6 − −13, 15 and 16 in Table 3 are satisfied. The Jacobian matrix of the system (2.1) evaluated at endemic equilibrium Y * can be written as

Clearly, −µ h is one root of J(Y * ), which is negative. The remaining roots can be determined from 215 the following characteristic equation which is given by

For this it is necessary to reduce the dimension of the system (2.1) by at least one as this method is applicable to systems whose order is at most four.
as t → ∞ (20), the system (2.1) reduces to the limit system
Clearly, the solutions of the limit system (4.4) with non-negative initial conditions remain nonnegative. Therefore, We can study the model in the following region
However, before going to the main result, let us discuss some preliminary results and definitions. Consider the autonomous dynamical system:ẋ
where f : D → R n , D ⊂ R n open set and simply connected and f ∈ C 1 (D). Let x * be the solution of
locally stable and all trajectories in D converges to x * .

Let Q(x) be a matrix of size n 2 × n 2 and Q ∈ C 1 (D). Suppose that Q −1 exists and it is continuous 233 in K. Where K is a compact absorbing set in D. 234 We define
where Q f is obtained replacing every entry q ij of Q by its directional derivatives with respect the 236 vectorial field f .
The Lozinskii measure µ(A) with respect to the norm . in R N , N = n 2 , is defined as (18),
We will apply the following (18)
The system (2.1) admits exactly one endemic equilibrium Y * when R 0 > 1 for the cases 1, 2, 6, 10 in Table 2 . Further, we know that the DFE Y 0 is unstable when R 0 > 1. The instability of P 0 , together with P 0 ∈ ∂Θ, which implies the uniform persistence of the state variable (21). Thus there exists a constant c > 0 such that any solution (
The uniform persistence of the system (4.4), incorporating the boundedness of Θ , suggests that the Table 2 are satisfied and
Then, the unique endemic equilibrium Y * of the system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable in region 245 Θ.
Proof. We show the global stability of Y * using the Muldowney's Theorem 4.2. We have to prove the 247 following to apply the theorem: 248 1. There exists a compact absorbing set K in the interior of Θ.
2. There is a number ν > 0 such that the Lozinskii measure satisfies µ(A) < −ν.
The uniform persistence together with the boundedness of Θ is equivalent to the existence of an 251 absorbing compact set in the interior of Θ(22). Now we have to prove that the Lozinskii measure
Let Q(t) be the following matrix of 6 × 6 which is invertible and C 1
We have
where Q f is obtained by replacing each entry Q ij of Q with the derivative of Q ij in the direction of the 282 vector field given by the system (2.1).
Then we obtain the matrix

From all cases. we obtain the following estimate

Since by the hypothesis
Therefore the Lozinskii measure satisfies
This completes the proof. phenomenon shows that if R 0 < 1, although the DFE is stable, another stable endemic equilibrium may 385 coexist simultaneously. When the multiple stable equilibrium coexist then the population will reach 386 the final equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. Backward bifurcation phenomenon for the 387 system (2.1) is shown in Fig. 1 . Here, a stable DFE and a stable endemic equilibrium point coexist 388 when 0 < R c < R 0 < 1, where R c is the critical value, which is shown in Fig. 1 and R c = 0.274 for the 389 given parameters values. In Fig. 1 , the green line represents the unstable equilibrium, while the blue line is established analytically. The Jacobian of the system (3.2) at diseases free equilibrium Y 0 is given as
Let β i be the bifurcation parameter and using R 0 = 1, we have
Here 0 is the simple eigen value and the jacobian J(Y 0 ) at β i = β * i has a right eigen vector corresponding eigen vector is given by
The following second order partial derivatives of g i at DFE Y 0 are calculated as follows: 
We see that the coefficient b is always positive, hence the system (2.1) undergoes backward bifurcation
The backward bifurcation phenomenon would occur for those values of R 0 such that R c < R 0 < 1. 
For forward transcritical bifurcation usually a model has two locally stable branches, one is DFE 427 when R 0 < 1, which is locally asymptotically stable and another is endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1, 428 which is stable. But there may be more than one stable endemic equilibrium for the model when R 0 > 1.
It is possible that more than one endemic equilibrium coexist in epidemic models even when R 0 > 1.
This leads to an unusual phenomenon of forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect, which is shown 431 numerically for our model (2.1). We find that our model exhibits a hysteresis effect where multiple 432 endemic equilibrium coexist for R 0 > 1 (see Fig. 2 ). The blue line represents two outer equilibrium, 433 which is stable while the green line represent the interior equilibrium, which is unstable. Further investigation reveals that the endemic equilibrium may also be stable in a region where 435 R 0 < 1 (see Fig. 3 ). This indicates that the disease may persist for R 0 < 1, even if the type of 436 transcritical bifurcation at R 0 = 1 is forward. Similarly, in case of hysteresis, these control measures will compel the solutions to the basin of attraction 447 of the lower endemic equilibrium. Here, we control the indirect transmission rate (β i ) for a certain period 448 of time, to force the solutions of the system to lower endemic value. We use the following to model this
For backward bifurcation case, we observe that a solution of the system approaches the upper equi- The vector-host interaction is assumed to be well-mixed in the proposed model 2. 
Similarly, the transmission term from infectious hosts to susceptible vectors is given by:
Here k 1 and k 2 are the levels of heterogeneity of vector-host and host-vector transmissions respec-480 tively. Since k 1 and k 2 both are the levels of heterogeneity, we assumed that k 1 = k 2 = k for simplicity.
Therefore, replacing these heterogeneity terms into our model 2.1, we obtain the following system of 
Using numerical simulations, the impact of the heterogeneity parameter k have been studied.

Further, we investigated the sensitivity of the parameters k, β i and β v with respect to the equilibrium 492 susceptible and infected host levels, Table 4 . It is observed that the equilibrium infected host level 493 increases with increase in the parameter k. to switch the stability of equilibria. In case of backward bifurcation, temporary control can curb the 507 disease endemic equilibrium to disease free state. On the other hand, the system can be brought to lower 508 endemic levels by the employment of temporary control. We found that the strength of psychological 509 effect will have significant contribution in lowering the endemic infection level of the host population.
Further investigation reveals that increase in transmission heterogeneity will ensure fast eradication of 511 the disease.
In summary, global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium indicate that the disease will persist 513 under certain parametrization of the system. Additionally, the diseases with two transmission routes can 514 exhibit bi-stable dynamics. These bi-stable feature of the diseases may impose significant difficulties on 515 disease control strategies. Moreover, efficient application of temporary control will be helpful in bi-stable 516 regions. While investigating the effect of heterogeneity, we observe that high levels of heterogeneities 517 will result in slower disease spread.
