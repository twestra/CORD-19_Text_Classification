Background. T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) 28 receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions. TIM-1 29 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains 30 unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have 31 suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a 32 BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein and demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 33 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. 34
Methodology/Principal findings. We used an infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus 35 expressing EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo 36 infection. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon α/β receptor -/mice were 37 challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV-GFP or G/rVSV-GFP. While G/rVSV caused profound 38 morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better 39 survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV 40 load in spleen was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in 41 serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, 42
suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher 43 virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-44 sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more 45 modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were 46 depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. 47

Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, 49 TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this 50 receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction 51 may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection. 52
53 Author summary 54 T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is one of a number of phosphatidylserine (PS) 55 receptors that mediate clearance of apoptotic bodies by binding PS on the surface of dead or 56 dying cells. Enveloped viruses mimic apoptotic bodies by exposing PS on the outer leaflet of the 57 viral membrane. While TIM-1 has been shown to serve as an adherence factor/receptor for 58 filoviruses in tissue culture, limited studies have investigated the role of TIM-1 as a receptor in 59 vivo. Here, we sought to determine if TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated 60 infection using a BSL2 model virus. We demonstrate that loss of TIM-1 expression results in 61 decreased virus load late during infection and significantly reduced virus-elicited mortality. 62 These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 serves as an important receptor for Ebola virus in 63 vivo. Blocking TIM-1/EBOV interactions may be effective antiviral strategy to reduce viral load 64 and pathogenicity at late times of EBOV infection. 65 66 .

The impact of the loss of TIM-1 was specific for EBOV GP-131 expressing virus since wild-type VSV was equally virulent in TIM-1-deficient and TIM-1-132 sufficient mice over a wide range of challenge doses. Importantly, reduced mortality observed 133 in the virus-infected TIM-1 -/mice was associated with lower virus load at late time points 134 during infection in multiple tissues previously appreciated to be important in EBOV 135 .

Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) is one of five species of ebolaviruses within the Filoviridae family. 68 EBOV continues to cause significant outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa with case fatality rates as 69 high as 90% [1] . All filoviruses have a broad species and cellular tropism. With the exception of 70 lymphocytes, most cells within the body are thought to support EBOV infection and replication 71 [2, 3] . Histopathological studies of EBOV infected humans and non-human primates (NHPs) 72
have demonstrated viral antigen in many different organs including: liver, spleen, lymph nodes, 73 kidney, adrenal glands, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, brain and heart [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . -/genotype (referred to as TIM-1 -/throughout this study). All expected genotypes 164 were produced in normal Mendelian ratios. Genomic DNA from mouse tail-clips was assessed 165 by PCR for genotypes. The primers and protocol for Ifnar -/screening has been previously 166 Organs were harvested from control and TIM-1 -/mice at 1, 3 or 5 days following infection 204 from with EBOV GP∆O/rVSV. Prior to euthanasia, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane to 205 perform retro-orbital bleeds for serum. Mice were euthanized and perfused with 10 mL of PBS 206 through the heart and organs harvested, weighed and frozen at -80ºC. To determine virus titers, 207 organs or sera were thawed and organs were homogenized in PBS and filtered through a 0.45 µ 208 syringe filter. Viral titers were determined by end point dilution on Vero cell as previously 209 Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect 216 proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines levels from organs of mice challenged with EBOV 217 GP∆O/rVSV. At time of harvest, organs were placed in Trizol and frozen at -80ºC until further 218 use. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Life Technologies) according 219 to manufacturer's tissue RNA isolation procedure. RNA was quantified by Nanodrop (Thermo 220 Scientific). Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers and the 221 High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). SYBR Green based 222 quantitative PCR reactions (Applied Biosystems) were performed using 1.5µL of a 1:100 223 dilution of cDNA from each reaction and specific primers for murine cytokines and 224 chemokines.

Further, WT VSV serves as an excellent control for in vivo studies with 287 EBOV GP/rVSV. We challenged TIM-1 -/and control mice with 10 5 iu of VSV by i.v. injection. 288
In contrast to our EBOV GP/rVSV findings, we observed no difference in the survival curve 289 between the two strains of mice (Fig. 1C ). Since it is likely that VSV bearing it native GP is 290 more pathogenic than a recombinant VSV containing a different viral GP, we also evaluated 291 mortality associated with different doses of VSV and found that administration of as little as 10 1 292 iu of VSV was lethal to Ifnar -/mice (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Thus, we repeated VSV infections in 293 control and TIM-1 -/mice at a challenge dose of 10 1 iu to determine if subtle changes in virus 294 pathogenesis could be discerned. Even at this low dose, there was no difference in the survival in 295 the TIM-1 -/mice versus the control mice (Fig. 1D ). These results provide evidence that the 296 difference in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in BALB/c Ifnar -/and TIM-1 -/mice was due to the 297 presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. The 298 reduced pathogenesis of EBOV GP expressing virus in TIM-1 -/mice was consistent with 299 findings described by Younan et al. using maEBOV [34] . 300 301
The effect of TIM-1 expression on viremia and organ viral loads following i.v. EBOV 304 GP∆O/rVSV infection was examined in serum and organs harvested 1, 3 or 5 days following 305 infection (Fig. 2) . Viremia and infectious virus in various organs were quantified by endpoint 306 dilution titering on Vero cells, a highly permissive cell line for EBOV GP/rVSV. At early times 307 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/466102 doi: bioRxiv preprint during infection, no difference in viremia or virus load was observed in most organs of TIM-1 308 versus control mice. However, by day 5 of EBOV GPΔO/rVSV infection, TIM-1 -/mice had a 309 100-fold reduction in viremia compared to control mice (Fig. 2) and a similar trend was observed 310 during infections with full length EBOV GP/rVSV (Supplement Fig. 3 ). In parallel, levels of 311 infectious virus in liver, kidney, and adrenal gland were also significantly reduced. Studies at day 312 5 of infection also indicated that EBOV GP∆O/rVSV loads were much reduced in the brain of 313 TIM-1 -/mice and trended lower in the testis (Supplement Fig. 4A at days -1 and 2. We verified that T cells within peripheral blood were profoundly depleted at 366 day 5 of infection by flow cytometry following immunostaining with an α-CD90 mAb (Fig. 5A) . 367
As observed for the T cell-competent mice in above studies, T cell-depleted control mice 368 challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV succumbed to the infection between 4-6 days. Likewise, while 369 T cell-depleted TIM-1 -/mice had significantly better survival than T cell depleted control mice 370 they did not exhibit improved survival over TIM-1 -/mice that were not T cell-depleted ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
