Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases.
We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-
Although the spread of COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is slowing down in China, it is rapidly growing outside the country, and how it will evolve remains unclear. So far, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2,000,000 people and led to nearly 135,000 deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic and is expected to cause one of the most serious global public health problems in recent years. 1 Of note, the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic are not only limited to global public health but also affect the global economy, geopolitics, culture, and society. Thus, an accurate prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 may provide valuable advice on how to effectively control its spread and relieve its major social and economic impacts. Although a number of studies have estimated the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak, most have used early-stage data and focused on cases in China. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] For example, using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model, Wang In this study, based on the public data of COVID-19 cases, we predicted its epidemic trend in China and across the world. We first built a prediction model using the publicly available data for COVID cases. These data include daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China since January 20, 2020. We trained our model using data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020, and predicted the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs. Furthermore, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 across the world (outside China) using models derived from those built based on Chinese cases.
We downloaded the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China from the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), including the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs since January 20, 2020. The data for the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside China were downloaded from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). learning algorithm that can automatically build predictive models from data. 9 We input daily numbers of CCCs and DCs and their corresponding days to obtain a formula that perfectly shaped the relationships between the variables. Due to insufficient sample sizes of the datasets for COVID-19 cases across the world (outside China) because of the recentness of the outbreak, we did not directly use Eureqa to build predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic trend across the world. We instead derived them from the models for Chinese cases on the assumption that the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China was similar to that in China with a time lag.
Furthermore, we predicted the epidemic trend in the European and North American countries where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, including Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA.

The daily mortality rate increases over time and becomes steady from early April 2020 (Fig. 1D) .
The COVID-19 outbreak across the world (outside China) has lagged behind that in China. We tried to predict its epidemic trend and found that the daily numbers of CCCs within the 14 consecutive days starting from February 27, 2020, across the world followed the same distribution as within the 14 consecutive days starting from January 26, 2020, in China (Kolmogorov−Smirnov (K−S) test, p = 1; Fig. 2A

Using this model, we predicted that a total of 276,000 people will have died of the COVID-19 disease when the outbreak is basically under control across the world (Fig. 2D ). The mortality rate for COVID-19, estimated by our predictive models, will be 4.6% across the world during the COVID-19 outbreak. This number is slightly higher than that (4.2%) for China.

We found that the numbers of daily NCs in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA followed a similar pattern to those in Italy with a 6-, 7-, 9-, 14-, and 10-day lag, respectively (K-S test, p = 1; Fig. 3B ). Accordingly, based on the model to predict the daily number of NCs in Italy, we generated models to predict the daily number of NCs in these countries 
, where Y is the number of NCs, X is the time (days), t is the days lagging behind, and β is the ratio of the population in that country to that in Italy. For Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA, t was 6, 7, 9, 14, and 10, respectively, and β was 0.79, 1.39, 1.10, 1.03, and 5.53, respectively. Based on these models, we predicted that the daily number of NCs would peak between April 4 and April 12, 2020, in Spain, between
March 30 and April 7, 2020, in Germany, between April 1 and April 9, 2020, in France, between April 6 and April 14, 2020, in UK, and between April 2 and April 10, 2020, in the USA (Fig. 3C ). After around April 20, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak will be gradually brought under control in these countries. The number of COVID-19
cases is expected to total around 204,000, 360,000, 286, 000, 268,000, and 1,434,000
in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the COVID-19 mortality rate in these countries based on the latest data on April 16, 2020. Likewise, the mortality rate on April 16, 2020, was calculated by dividing the number of DCs on this day by the number of CCCs 10 days before. Accordingly, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 12%, 3.2%, 14.5%, 19.6%, and 6% in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA, respectively. Based on these estimated mortality rates, we All rights reserved.

The COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world. Although this disease appears to be well controlled in China, the recent dramatic increase in new cases and deaths outside China indicates that the outbreak may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of the necessary mitigation measures. However, the experience of China suggests that the outbreak is controllable if effective strategies are employed. 8 Because the COVID-19 outbreak outside China is in the initial or exponential expansion phase, depending on the region or country, it is currently difficult to predict the major turning points in the COVID-19 epidemic outside China based on their data. Therefore, we assumed that the COVID-19 outbreak outside China follows a similar pattern to that in China, and accordingly derived predictive models for the epidemic outside China from models built based on Chinese cases. Our models predicted that the COVID-19 outbreak would peak across the world around May 22, 2020, and would be basically under control around February 21, 2020 (Fig. 4A) . It should be noted that these predictions were made under the premise that countries outside China implement comprehensive and stringent control measures as in China, such as city lockdowns, traffic control, and concentrated medical support for seriously infected areas. Otherwise, the epidemic outside China could follow a different trend, for example, a prolonged All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Actually, the COVID-19 outbreak has shown to be more serious than expected in the USA and several Europe countries, including Italy, Spain, France, UK, and Germany, indicating that the early preventive and responsive measures to COVID-19 were insufficient in these countries (Fig. 4B) .
Our model predicted that the number of NCs would peak on April 9, 2020, outside
China. This is consistent with a recent prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Italy. 12 We estimated the mortality rate for COVID-19 to be 4.6% outside China. This number may vary by region and country. For example, the current mortality rate is 12.3% in Italy, compared with 0.1% in Germany. It should be noted that the estimated mortality rate could exceed the actual mortality rate, considering that a number of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic cases might not be identified.
Actually, a study of 1,099 Chinese cases indicated that the COVID-19 mortality rate in China is 1.4%. 13 If this is true, then the total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 230,000, a number far exceeding that reported presently.
The recent rapid spreading of COVID-19 in Europe and the USA highlights the importance of implementing more stringent control measures. Indeed, China's experiences in containing the spread of COVID-19 can be learnt by other countries currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 4C) . For example, China has effectively blocked the massive spreading of COVID-19 by the immediate lockdown All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

China has implemented the classification management of hospitals with some hospitals concentrating on serving critical COVID-19 cases and others designated for routine medical care. In addition, numerous mobile hospitals have been built to admit suspected and mild patients in China, and strict quarantine rules are enforced. In China, masks are widely used in public area, although the role of face masks in preventing the spread of viruses is debatable.
A limitation of this study is that in deriving predictive models for global cases, we did not take into account factors other than demographics that are associated with the spread and outbreak of COVID-19. These include politics, economy, culture,
