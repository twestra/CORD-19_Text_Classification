Bats are notorious reservoirs of diverse, potentially zoonotic viruses, exemplified by the 20 evolutionarily distinct, influenza A-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11 (BatIVs). The surface 21 glycoproteins [haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)] of BatIVs neither bind nor cleave 22 sialic acid receptors, which suggests that these viruses employ cell attachment and entry 23 mechanisms that differ from those of classical influenza A viruses (IAVs). Identifying the 24 cellular factors that mediate entry and determine susceptibility to infection will help assess 25 the host range of BatIVs. Here, we investigated a range of cell lines from different species for 26 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We show that a number of human haematopoietic cancer cell lines 28 and the canine kidney MDCK II (but not MDCK I) cells are susceptible to H17-pseudotypes 29 (H17-PV). We observed with microarrays and qRT-PCR that the dog leukocyte antigen DLA-30 DRA mRNA is over expressed in late passaged parental MDCK and commercial MDCK II cells, 31 compared to early passaged parental MDCK and MDCK I cells, respectively. The human 32 orthologue HLA-DRA encodes the alpha subunit of the MHC class II HLA-DR antigen-binding 33 heterodimer. Small interfering RNA-or neutralizing antibody-targeting HLA-DRA, drastically 34 reduced the susceptibility of Raji B cells to H17-PV. Conversely, over expression of HLA-DRA 35 and its paralogue HLA-DRB1 on the surface of the unsusceptible HEK293T/17 cells conferred 36 susceptibility to H17-PV. The identification of HLA-DR as an H17N10 entry mediator will 37 contribute to a better understanding of the tropism of the virus and will elucidate its zoonotic 38 transmission. 39 40
to accommodate SA 2, 15, 17 . The cell receptors for the BatIVs are as yet unidentified, but they 79 are clearly not SA moieties, a conclusion reached by several studies 15, 18, 19 . Furthermore, bat 80 N10 and N11 are structurally similar to classical NAs but lack conserved amino acids for SA 81 binding and cleavage 2, 16, 17 and do not exhibit typical neuraminidase activity 18, 20 . Initial 82 efforts to isolate infectious BatIVs directly from bats have failed, mainly because the receptors 83
were unknown and susceptible cell lines were unavailable 21, 22, 23 . Attempts to circumvent 84 these limitations have included H17-or H18-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV 19, 85 DLA-DRA is a well-conserved orthologue of the human leukocyte antigen class II DR α-chain 157 (HLA-DRA) (∼90% amino acid identity between canine, human and Desmodus rotundus bat 158 ectodomains; Supplementary material 3). In humans, MHC-II molecules occur as three highly 159 polymorphic isotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ) which are selectively expressed 160 under normal conditions on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), including B, 161 dendritic and mononuclear phagocyte cells. These molecules are non-covalently associated 162 heterodimers of two glycosylated, transmembrane polypeptide chains, the monomorphic 163 35-kDa α-chain and the highly polymorphic 28-kDa β-chain 36 . Both chains have an 164 extracellular portion composed of two domains (α1 and α2, or β1 and β2) that is anchored 165 on the cell membrane by short transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2c ). In the 166 classical scenario, the protease-derived foreign antigen peptides bind to MHC class II proteins 167 in the cleft formed by the α1 and β1 domains, and the complex is transported to the cell 168 surface 36, 37 . When antigenic peptides are not available, endogenous peptides such as the class 169 II associated invariant peptide (CLIP) substitute them and restore MHC class II dimer 170 stability 37 . The complex of HLA-DR and endocytosed peptides (usually 9-30 amino acids in 171 length), constitutes a ligand for the T-cell receptor (TCR) and plays a key role in the 172 presentation of foreign antigens to CD4 + T helper cells and immune surveillance 38, 39 . 173
Since the ultimate goal of our studies is to obtain insight on the zoonotic potential of H17N10, 175 we focused on the possible influence of HLA-DR on cellular susceptibility to H17. Hence, 176 taking advantage of the high expression of HLA-DR on certain human hematopoietic 177 carcinomas 40 , we further explored H17-PV tropism using a panel of human leukaemia and 178 lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 2d) . We found that the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji, Ramos and 179 BJAB B-lymphocytes and the B lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) show decreasing susceptibility, 180 in that order, to H17-PV. Kasumi-1 leukaemic cells showed marginal susceptibility in terms of 181 luciferase activity, while Molt-4 and HL-60 leukaemic cells, Jurkat T-cells, pro-monocytic THP-182 1 and U-937 cells, and primary B cells showed no susceptibility to the pseudotypes (Fig. 2d,  183 left Y axis). We hypothesised that the different susceptibility of the various cell types by H17-184 PV were due to disparate expression of HLA-DR, confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis for a non-185 polymorphic region of the α chain of HLA-DR on the same samples (Fig. 2d , right Y-axis). The 186
presence of the HLA-DR heterodimer was also confirmed by flow cytometry with a FITC-187 conjugated monoclonal antibody (clone Tü36), which specifically binds to a monomorphic 188 epitope on the HLA-DR α/β complex and not the isolated α or β chains (Fig. 2e) cells correspondingly reduced the infection of H17-PV by 50% (Fig. 2f) . 203
To determine if blocking attachment of virus to the HLA-DR ectodomain can prevent its entry, 205
Raji cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 206 Clone 302CT2.3.2) targeting a monomorphic, extracellular region of the HLA-DRA antigen 207 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The presence of the antibody significantly reduced, in 208 a dose-dependent manner, infection with H17-PV but not VSV-G-PV (Fig. 2g) . 209
We next sought to ascertain whether ectopic expression of HLA-DR was sufficient to increase 211 the susceptibility of non-APC, HEK293T/17, cells to the H17-PVs. HEK293T/17 cells were 212 transiently transfected with the DRA expression vector, alone or in combination with DRB1. Taken together, HLA-DR is shown to function as a bona fide entry mediator for H17 but may 226 function with unknown factors that facilitate virus internalisation. Interaction between HLA-227 DR and H17 may trigger viral entry through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, but 228 could also trigger entry through an activation of cell signalling pathways that the virus 229 subverts to its advantage. Our finding therefore raises questions on the utility and possible 230 evolutionary advantage(s) that an APC-associated receptor would confer to H17N10 231 infectivity and broader fitness.

The measles virus for example, exploits macrophages or 234 dendritic cells, which traffic the virus to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue or regional 235 lymph nodes, resulting in local amplification and subsequent systemic dissemination by 236 viremia 46 . A similar strategy employed by H17N10 could provide an explanation on why viral 237 RNA was detected in different organs and tissues in carrier S. lilium bats (i.e. lung, kidney, 238 liver, intestine) and why the virus fails to grow in vitro in cell lines developed from the same 239 In this study we did not establish the stoichiometry of the HLA-DR: H17 engagement, or 250 clarify how the virus moves to sub-membranous regions and might hijack the receptor-251 mediated signalling pathway to promote its internalization. It is likely that the determinants 252 of viral entry in vivo are more complicated. We cannot rule out the use by H17N10 (as by 253 other bat-borne viruses, e.g. SARS CoV 51, 52 ) of more than one molecular species as (co-) 254 receptors. Nevertheless, the implication of this study is that H17N10 has the capacity to 255 enter human HLA-DR + cells and our work provides substantial evidence that the H17N10 256 virus has zoonotic potential. The current finding not only sheds light on the understanding 257 of BatIV host range, but also provides additional information on the evolution of influenza 258 A viruses. 259 author/funder.
