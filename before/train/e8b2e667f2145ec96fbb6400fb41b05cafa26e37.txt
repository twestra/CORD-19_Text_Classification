20 This work aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic potential against cancer cells of Passiflora genus 21 plant species cultivated in Brazil and identify the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by the 22 most promising extract. Leaf extracts from 14 Passiflora (P.) species were obtained ASE and 23 in vitro cytotoxicity evaluated against cancer cell lines using MTT assay at a single .

Additionally, the IC 50 of the P. alata (ELPA) leaf extracts was 25 determined against both tumor (HCT-116, SF-295, OVACAR-8, and HL-60), and non-tumor 26 cells (PBMC). The ELPA flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS. 27 The morphological analyses used light and fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle and DNA 28 fragmentation analyses used flow cytometry to determine the mechanism of cell death induced 29 by ELPA in HL-60. Among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated; ELPA stood out with high 30 cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis and P. quadrangulares with varying high and low 31 cytotoxic activity. ELPA presented high cytotoxic potency in HL-60 (IC 50 19.37 μg/mL), yet 32 without cytotoxic activity against PBMC, suggesting selectivity for tumor cells. The cytotoxic 33 activity of ELPA may well be linked to the presence of ten identified flavonoids. Cells treated 34 with ELPA presented the hallmarks typical of apoptosis and necrosis, with cell cycle arrest in 35 the G2/M phase. Conclusion: From among the studied species, ELPA presented greater 36 cytotoxic activity, possibly a consequence of synergistic flavonoid action which induces cell 37 death by apoptosis and necrosis.
165 mg/mL) was added, followed by incubation at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 for 3 hours.
166 After incubation, the formazan product was dissolved in 150 μL DMSO, and absorbance was 167 measured using a multi-plate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter Inc. (Table   241 1 ). The results were analyzed for each cell line tested using a GI% scale as follows: samples 242 with low cytotoxic activity have GI < 50%; samples with moderate cytotoxic activity have GI 243 between 50% and 75%, and samples with high cytotoxic activity have GI > 75% (25). The 244 results showed that the extracts of P. cincinnata (3), P. gibertii (4), P. maliforms (5), P.

Extracts from P. capsularis (2) and P. quadrangulares (9) 248 have high activity against HCT-116, low activity against SF-295, and cytotoxic activity from 249 low (P. quadrangulares) to moderate (P. capsularis) against OVACAR-8. The extract from 250 the leaves of P. alata (1) presented high cytotoxic activity in all human cancer cell lines 251 analyzed. Therefore, among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated P. alata (1) stands out with 252 promising cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis (2) and P. quadrangulares (9). (Table 2) .
The cytotoxic activity of natural bioactive products against cancer cells is attributed to 295 the chemical composition of the product, and this practice of identification is the most 296 successful source of potential drug discovery and development (7).
