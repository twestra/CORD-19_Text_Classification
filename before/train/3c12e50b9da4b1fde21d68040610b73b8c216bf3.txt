Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies 19 implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but 20 the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-21 guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the 22 ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 23 processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type 26 virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively 28 regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type 29 virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that 33 PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.

Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that 36 function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune 37 response.

To 40 separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis 41 approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating 42 the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease 43 activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed 44 that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and 45 exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is 46 an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses. 47 48 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses 49 with large (~30kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested 50 set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1, 2). The genome 51
organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5'-most two-thirds of the genome 52 encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural 53 proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes, 54 which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes 55 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within 56 the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3). Interestingly, 57 coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or 58 delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, 4-8). That a slew of coronavirus-encoded 59 accessory and non-accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response 60 suggests that viral-mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection.

Coronavirus proteases are essential for viral replication as they are responsible for processing 64 the replicase polyprotein (2,(9)(10)(11). Murine coronavirus MHV encodes three proteases: two 65 papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) and one chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also termed 66 Mpro). MHV PLP2 is similar to the single papain-like protease (termed PLpro) of Severe Acute 67 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 68 Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (9, 12-16). We and others have revealed that PLP2 or PLpro of 69 multiple coronaviruses, including MHV, are multifunctional, not only capable of cleaving the viral 70 polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylating (de-conjugating ISG15 71 molecule from modified substrates) activities (9, 12, 13, 15-27). However, it has been challenging 72 to study the effects of a mutated DUB on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease 73 and DUB activities share the same catalytic site, disruption of which is lethal for virus replication.
74
Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify residue(s) within the MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin 75 binding surface that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 76 processing. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided identification of such residues 77 and evaluate the replication, IFN antagonistic effect, and pathogenesis of a recombinant DUB 78 mutant MHV.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/782409 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 preserving the enzyme's deISGylating and protease activities, the latter being necessary for viral 84 replication. X-ray structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs co-85 crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo- 86 propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct 87 interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20). Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the 88 catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-crystallized it with free 89 ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin was determined 90 to a resolution of 1.85 Å and an overall Rfree = 19.6% and Rwork = 15.8% (PDB: 5WFI). The overall 91 structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound 92 structures (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc-fingers 93 motif while the C-terminus extends into the active site. 94 Next, we aligned the primary amino acid sequence of the MHV PLP2 domain with the 95 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease domains (Fig. 1E) . The sequence alignment and 96 X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex were then analyzed in conjunction with the 97 previous structural and mutagenesis studies on SARS-and MERS-CoV to identify candidate 98 residues that could be mutated to render a loss of DUB activity in vitro. From this analysis, we 99 identified three residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with 100 ubiquitin (Fig. 1B-D) . Two of the side chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen 101 bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B) . The two side chain 102 carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with 103 each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig.   104 1C). Finally, F1812 forms Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of I44 and V70 and the 105 delta-carbon of R42 of ubiquitin (Fig. 1D) .

To identify a mutant MHV PLP2 enzyme that 107 retains protease activity but exhibits reduced DUB and/or deISGylating activity, we performed 108 site-directed mutagenesis on each of the residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) by changing each to an 109 alanine to disrupt interactions with ubiquitin. Each mutant enzyme was expressed, purified, and 110 tested for its ability to hydrolyze three substrates: z-RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC.
The activity of each mutant enzyme toward each substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme is 112 shown in Fig. 2A . All three mutants retained their ability to hydrolyze the peptide substrate but 113 each mutant had altered specificity toward Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates. Mutation of 114 F1812 resulted in a substantial decrease in hydrolysis of both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (Class 115 I), whereas mutation of R1803 resulted in loss of activity only toward ISG15-AMC (Class II), and 116 mutation of D1772 resulted in loss of activity only toward Ub-AMC (Class III). 117 151 All rights reserved.

Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred 335 to PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 hour 336
at 60 Volts at 4°C. Following this, the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST 337 buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4°C. The membrane 338 was incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Life Technologies) for 339 the protease assay, or mouse anti-flag (F3165, Sigma) for the DUB assay. The membrane was then 340 washed three times for 15 minutes in TBST buffer followed by incubation with either secondary 341 donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (711-035-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse-342 HRP antibody (1010-05, SouthernBiotech). Then the membrane was washed three more times for 343 15 minutes in TBST buffer. Detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence 344 Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) and visualized using a FluoroChemE Imager (Protein Simple). The 345 expression of PLP2, β-actin, and calnexin were probed with mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960, 346 ThermoFisher), mouse anti-β-actin (A00702, Genscript), or mouse anti-calnexin antibody (2433S, 347 Cell Signaling), respectively. 348 Biosensor live cell assay 349
The protease activity of PLP2 was also assessed using a biosensor live cell assay as 350 described previously (14). Briefly, HEK293T cells in a 96 black-wall plate were transfected with 351 37.5 ng pGlo-RLKGG construct and 50 ng PLP2 expression plasmids. GloSensor (E1290, 352 Promega) reagent diluted in DMEM+10% FCS was added at 18 hpi. Plates were read using a 353 luminometer (Veritas) every hour over a course of 5 hours. 354 All rights reserved.

Since one of the primary goals of this study is to understand the contribution of DUB 118 activity to viral replication and pathogenesis, we next focused on quantitating further the effects 119 of the D1772A mutant on the steady-state kinetic parameters of MHV PLP2 toward the three 120 different substrates (Fig. 2B) . The RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate is often used as surrogate of 121 the viral polyprotein substrate and the kinetic data in Fig. 2B show that this substrate is still well-122 recognized and cleaved by the D1772A mutant. In fact, we observed a small rate enhancement in 123 the catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme.
The Ub-AMC substrate, on the other hand, is poorly recognized and cleaved by the 125 D1772A mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type enzyme normally interacts 126 strongly with Ub-AMC with a Km value of 0.67 µM. However, mutation of D1772 to an alanine 127 significantly disrupts the interaction with ubiquitin, making it impossible to saturate MHV PLP2 128 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/782409 doi: bioRxiv preprint under normal experimental conditions (Fig. 2B ). The net result is a significant reduction in the 129 catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme, which was the goal of these trials. 130 The kinetic response of MHV PLP2 toward another substrate, ISG15-AMC, was also 131 determined. ISG15 is an important ubiquitin-like modifier that is upregulated and used to ISGylate 132 host proteins during viral infection. A number of viruses, including coronaviruses, engender 133 ISGylation during infection but the function(s) and importance of this activity are not clear 30). For MHV, neither the wild-type nor the D1772A mutant PLP2 enzyme can be saturated with 135 ISG15-AMC, suggesting weak binding with this ubiquitin-like modifier (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, the 136 R1772A mutation does not disrupt the interaction with ISG15 but in fact enhances it to some 137 degree. A potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems 138 from our analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that 139 interact with D1772 (Fig. 2C ). The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in 140 human and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan 141 in human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would 142 not be expected to alter ISG15 binding. In contrast to R42, residue R72 is conserved in both 143 ubiquitin and ISG15 and its interaction with MHV PLP2 for ubiquitin is likely weaker than that 144 with ISG15.
146 culture based assays. The in vitro biochemical studies presented here support the notion that we 147 are able to use a structure-guided mutagenesis to uncouple the DUB enzymatic activity from MHV 148 PLP2 while preserving the peptide hydrolysis and deISGylating activities of PLP2. Next, we 149 focused on comparing the activity of the mutant enzyme to its wild-type counterpart for the ability 150 to remove Flag-tagged-ubiquitin conjugated to host proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 3A) . We found 8 that in cells, wild-type PLP2 exhibits robust DUB activity and removes ubiquitin modifications 152 from multiple cellular proteins. On the other hand, the PLP2-D1772A mutant exhibits reduced 153 DUB activity, similar to that of the previously documented catalytic cysteine to alanine mutant, 154 PLP2-CA (19). To determine if this impaired DUB activity altered the ability of PLP2 to act as an 155 interferon antagonist, we transfected cells with a RIG-I expression plasmid, an interferon-156 luciferase reporter construct, and either wild-type or mutant PLP2 plasmid and measured luciferase 157 activity at 18 hours post-transfection. In agreement with previous reports (13, 25, 31), we find that 158 wild-type PLP2 acts as an interferon antagonist, reducing reporter activity by 50-80%. In contrast, 159 PLP2-D1772A is unable to significantly reduce interferon activation in this assay despite similar 160 expression levels of the wild-type and mutant versions of the protein (Fig. 3B ). We also evaluated 161 the protease activity of the enzymes in cells using two independent trans-cleavage assays and 162 found that the wild-type and DUB-mutant enzymes produce similar levels of cleaved products. 163 These results indicate that the D1772A substitution did not alter protease activity (Fig. 3C and D), 164 in agreement with the in vitro kinetic results described above (Fig. 2) . Together, these studies 165 reveal that aspartic acid residue 1772 of MHV-PLP2 is important for DUB activity and interferon 166 antagonism, but not for protease activity.
Recombinant MHV harboring PLP2-D1772A activates an earlier IFN response in bone 168 marrow-derived macrophages. Since the D1772A substitution did not impact protease activity, 169 we reasoned that we should be able to generate recombinant virus containing this substitution, 170 thereby allowing us to determine if the mutation has any effect on viral replication kinetics and 171 interferon antagonism in the context of the live virus. We engineered the mutant virus via reverse 172 genetics (32), performed full genome sequencing to verify the genotype (2 nucleotide changes at 173 positions 5525 and 5526, resulting in D1772A substitution in the replicase polyprotein), and 174 All rights reserved.

Upon evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by 175 performing a growth kinetics experiment in parallel with wild-type virus, we found that the 176 DUBmut virus replicates with essentially identical kinetics as the wild-type in a murine 177 astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig. 4A ). These results are consistent with previous studies of 178 coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that viral-mediated interferon 179 antagonism is not essential for virus replication (5, 6). Regarding the other ubiquitin-interacting 180 residues identified in the structural analysis, we attempted to rescue virus with substitutions at the 181 F1812 position, but were unable to recover viable virus. These results indicate that F1812 may 182 play a critical role within the polyprotein during virus replication. We were able to recover virus 183 containing the R1803A substitution, but found that it had no detectable phenotype, which we 184 documented in our previous study (5). Here, we focus our efforts on evaluating replication and IFNprotein into the supernatant, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 4B ). We show that this activation 191 of IFN is dependent on expression of pattern recognition receptor MDA5 (Fig. 4D ), in agreement 192 with previous reports (5, 6, 33). To our surprise, we found that replication of DUBmut is not 193 impaired relative to the wild-type virus in BMDMs, as measured by level of nucleocapsid RNA 194 (Fig. 4E ) and evaluation of infectious virus particle production over time in the kinetics assay (Fig. 195 4F).

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/782409 doi: bioRxiv preprint (D1772A), we found that the DUB activity of PLP2 was greatly reduced and a recombinant MHV 219 carrying this mutation (DUBmut) activated an earlier IFN response in macrophages. Although we 220 only observed a subtle attenuation of the DUBmut virus in the tested animal models, we 221 demonstrated that PLP2 DUB activity does play a role in suppressing the host immune response 222 and is a virulence trait, strengthening our earlier discoveries on SARS-CoV PLpro (4). We further 223 investigated the differences in the interferon response generated in response to WT versus 224 DUBmut virus in our companion study (Volk et al., submitted) , which further supports a role for 225 DUB activity in modulating the interferon response in macrophages.
The structure-guided approach used to generate the DUBmut virus allowed for substitution. The deISGylating ability of the enzyme is also not affected. In contrast, the mutant 237 enzyme's deubiquitinating activity is significantly reduced relative to wild-type, which is most 238 likely due to a lowered binding affinity for ubiquitin as the enzyme could not be saturated with 239 Ub-AMC as a substrate. 240 All rights reserved.

We can also use these structural, mutagenesis and kinetic characterization studies on MHV 241 PLP2 to guide future structure-based design studies of emerging coronaviruses, such as the newly We were able to reproduce the enzymatic profile of the purified PLP2-D1772A mutant 256 protein when we expressed it in cell culture (Fig. 3) . Therefore, our finding that the DUBmut virus 257 containing the PLP2-D1772A substitution activates an elevated antiviral response in macrophages 258 compared to the wild-type virus, but that this antiviral state results in only mild attenuation of 259 disease in mice relative to WT infection, was unexpected. Previous studies demonstrated that 260 ubiquitin has important roles in both the activation and the attenuation of innate antiviral pathways 261 (39); therefore, we anticipated a more remarkable phenotype for a DUB-mutant virus.
