Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This 20 study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to 21 assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial 22 bronchitis. 23
Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with 24 persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent 25 bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene 26 quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene 27 sequencing. 28
No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R 2 = 0.01, P = 29 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind 30 brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important 31 implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. 32 A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community 33 composition (R 2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial 34 communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator 35 species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with 36 the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not 37 identified by standard routine clinical culture. 38
The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less 39 diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and 40
suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead 41 to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease 42 burden. 43
Persistent or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough 45 lasting more than 4 weeks in young children. PBB is particularly common in pre-school 46 children, often developing after a viral lower respiratory infection[1, 2], but may present at 47 any age. As a result, PBB is often either misdiagnosed as asthma or the symptoms are 48 dismissed as being due to recurrent viral infection [1] [2] [3] . 49 50 Standard treatment for PBB is high dose oral antibiotics, the cough typically taking 10 -14 51 days to resolve [4] . Although the aim of therapy is to provide a definitive cure, reoccurrences 52 are frequent and if not treated successfully may lead to bronchiectasis [1] [2] [3] [4] . 53 54 Our understanding of the role of bacteria in chronic respiratory diseases is changing rapidly. 55
Until recently it was widely believed that the healthy lung was a sterile environment [5] . A 56 growing body of evidence, however, indicates that the healthy airways have a resident 57 microbiota which can vary between individuals[5-7] and can alter significantly as a result of 58 respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma [8] . 59 60 A previous study of children with PBB using 16S rRNA gene sequencing suggested that the 61 bacterial communities present in their lungs demonstrated similarities to those seen in 62 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis [9] . This study provided a useful 63 insight into the bacterial community associated with PBB, although the control subjects were 64 undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications and could not be considered to be 65 healthy [9] [10] [11] . 66 67 .

This has given the opportunity for a better 70 understanding of the microbiota of the healthy airway in childhood, as well as insight into 71 how it is perturbed in children with PBB. In addition, the validity of characterising the lower 72 airways microbiome using blind brushings through an endotracheal tube as opposed to more 73 invasive bronchoscope guided sampling has been investigated. 74 75 76 .

The study subjects were all 17 years of age or younger. None of these subjects had an 82 identified significant immunodeficiency or other conditions. 83 84 Control subjects were recruited if they were undergoing an intervention requiring 85 endotracheal intubation but were otherwise healthy without any history of acute or chronic 86 upper or lower respiratory tracts symptoms. 87 88 Sixteen mothers of enrolled children aged â‰¤ 2 years had nasal and oropharyngeal (throat) 89 swabs taken (S1 Table) number of reads/OTU). Samples above the 1,000 read cut off recommended by QIIME were 144 rarefied to the minimum number of reads found in the samples. Considering community composition no significant differences were observed between the 157 different sampling methods (Adonis: R 2 =0.012, P= 0.344). Hierarchical clustering using 158
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity revealed that the samples clustered more closely between patients 159 than within sampling groups (Fig 1) . 160

Samples were rarefied to 1,150 reads, resulting in the loss of 2 control 171 patients. No difference in the bacterial abundance by qPCR was observed between the 172 healthy controls and PBB patients (R 2 = 0.021, P = 0.511) (Fig 2) .

Adonis showed significant differences in community composition (R 2 = 0.082, P = 0.001). 189

Overall the samples 262 collected from the mothers compared to those from the PBB children were significantly 263 different, however there was a single exception. The bacterial communities present in the 264 throat swab of the mother and the blind brush from the child of family 34 were found to have 265 in common a high abundance of Streptococcus, as well as Veillonella and Neisseria (Fig 6) .
