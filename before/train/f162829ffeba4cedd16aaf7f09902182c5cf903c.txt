Understanding the causes of the cost is considered the Holy Grail in the antibiotic resistance field, as it is the main determinant of the prevalence of resistances upon reducing antibiotics use.
We show that DNA breaks can explain most of the variation in the cost of resistances common in pathogens. Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug. In summary, we revealed key mechanisms underlying the cost of antibiotic resistance that can be exploited to specifically eliminate resistant bacteria.
Antibiotic resistance entails a large health and economic burden worldwide (1). Its maintenance and spread in bacterial populations depend on the rate at which resistance is acquired and on its effect on bacterial fitness. This effect is typically deleterious, resulting in the so-called cost of resistance. The cost of resistance is influenced by the environment, by interactions between the resistances and the genetic background in which they appear (epistasis), and by subsequent acquisition of mutations compensating for fitness defects (compensatory evolution) (2). Importantly, the magnitude of the cost is the main biological parameter influencing the fate of resistances upon reducing antibiotic use (3).
Despite its importance, the causes of the cost are far from being completely understood (4), and the identification of these causes has become the "Holy Grail" in the antibiotic resistance field.
Resistance mutations often map to genes encoding proteins targeted by antibiotics. These target proteins are typically involved in essential functions, such as transcription, translation, DNA replication or cell wall biosynthesis. Resistance mutations cause alterations in the structure of the target protein, rendering it insensitive to the drug, but often adversely affecting its function (2,3,5). These pleiotropic effects hold the key to manipulating resistance levels in bacterial populations (3). Rifampicin and streptomycin resistance mutations (Rif R and Str R ), common in pathogenic bacteria (6-8), map to the genes rpoB and rpsL, encoding the β' subunit of the RNA polymerase and the protein S12 of the 30S ribosomal subunit, respectively. Rif R and Str R mutations are representative examples of resistances to antibiotics targeting transcription and translation, respectively. Rif R mutations show different costs (9,10) and cause alterations in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, slippage or termination (9,11-23). Likewise, most Str R mutations also cause a cost (24-26) and affect translation fidelity and processivity (24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Thus, at present, the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are thought to be caused by defects in protein synthesis, either at a global cellular level (35-37) or limited to specific functions or regulons (22, 24, 38, 39) .
We recently showed that the fitness cost of double resistance (Rif R Str R ) can be reduced via overexpression of nusG or nusE (40), which encode the proteins that physically connect the RNA polymerase and the ribosome (41). This suggests that the reduction of the cost can be achieved by reinforcing the coupling between transcription and translation, besides the previously described partial recovery in protein biosynthesis (3). Coupling between transcription and translation is known to prevent spontaneous backtracking of the RNA polymerase which, if exacerbated, can cause a series of molecular events that ultimately lead to the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (42)(43) (44) (45) (46) . This led us to hypothesize that cells carrying different Rif R and Str R mutations have higher number of DNA breaks, which greatly contribute to their cost.
In this study, we show that DNA breaks caused by resistance mutations are major contributors to their fitness cost, explaining 73% of its variation across resistant genotypes. The involvement of Rloops in the generation of DNA breaks allowed us to identify RNase HI as an important determinant of the cost of resistance, which we validate using a repurposed drug. We further show that targeting RNase HI is a plausible strategy for the selective elimination of resistant bacteria, as lack of RNase HI leads to extinction of resistant clones when competing against sensitive bacteria in laboratory conditions, abolishing compensatory evolution. Importantly, eradication of resistant bacteria lacking RNase HI is remarkably efficient in the mammalian gut as well. Altogether, we reveal an unexpected cause of the cost of antibiotic resistance, which can be exploited to selectively eliminate resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations.

In order to test if Rif R and Str R mutations generate DNA breaks, and whether DNA breaks contribute to the cost of resistance, we simultaneously measured competitive fitness and activation of the SOS response, a well-known proxy specific for the occurrence of DNA breaks (47,48). We carried out these assays in sensitive Escherichia coli, Str R strains (RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , and RpsL K43R ), Rif R strains (RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ), and double resistant mutants carrying the nine possible combinations of these resistance alleles. Remarkably, fourteen out of the fifteen resistant strains show increased SOS activation ( Figure 1A ), demonstrating that resistance mutations indeed cause DNA breaks. Moreover, the SOS induction strongly correlates with the cost of resistance, explaining 73% of its variation ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance. To independently confirm the occurrence of DNA breaks in resistant bacteria, we used a system which permits direct visualization of double-stranded DNA ends by fluorescence microscopy (49). We combined this system with the SOS reporter, and analyzed a subset of resistant mutants and sensitive bacteria. As expected, this corroborated that resistance mutations indeed cause increased number of DNA breaks (Table 1, Figure S1 ). We then asked if resistance mutations involving a different mechanism which could lead to perturbations of transcription-translation coupling also generate DNA breaks. The commonly used antibiotic erythromycin targets the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting translation and its coupling with transcription (50). Erythromycin resistance mutations (Erm R ) mapping to the genes rplD and rplV (encoding the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins L4 and L22, respectively) are known to reduce translation elongation rate (51,52), likely affecting transcription-translation coupling.
We isolated Erm R clones carrying either RplD G66R or RplV Δ(82-84) mutations and found that both mutants show fitness cost and increased SOS ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating that other resistance mutations, with a 99 double orbital shaking (set as "fast") in a Biotek SYNERGY H1 benchtop microplate reader, measuring OD600 every 30 minutes during 24h.
Adult C57BL/6J female mice (six to eight weeks old) were kept in ventilated cages under specified pathogen free (SPF) barrier conditions at the animal facility of the IGC. To overcome bacterial colonization resistance, mice were treated with streptomycin (5 g/L) in drinking water during seven days and then put on regular autoclaved water for two days to wash out the antibiotic from the intestine. The following day, animals were deprived of food and water during the 4 hours prior to inoculation by oral gavage of 100 µl of bacterial suspension containing ~10 9 cells. All animals were then individually-caged, with food and water being available ad libitum. Each animal (6 per group) was gavaged with a mix (9:1) of CFP-tagged sensitive (either WT or ΔrnhA) and YFP-labeled double resistant bacteria (either RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y or ΔrnhA RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ). In order to obtain the bacterial suspensions, the strains were streaked individually onto appropriate antibiotic-supplemented LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, three independent colonies from each strain were inoculated separately in assay tubes containing 5ml of BHI broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m).
The next day, each bacterial culture was diluted 100-fold (20 µl of overnight culture in 2 ml of fresh BHI broth, in 125 ml flasks) and incubated at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m) until reaching an OD600 ≈ 2. Then the cultures were washed once with 1X PBS and Flow cytometry was used to assess the appropriate cells numbers and prepare bacterial mixes for gavage. Mouse fecal pellets were collected at 8 hours after gavage, and afterwards on a daily basis during 13 days, to analyze the loads and frequency of each strain colonizing the gut along time. Fecal samples were stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C. In order to measure the loads (CFUs/g of feces) and the frequency of each strain along the experiment,
Introduction different mechanistic basis but affecting the same process (transcription-translation coupling) also cause DNA breaks.
We then hypothesized that, if DNA breaks are key contributors to the fitness cost of resistance, compensatory evolution of resistant strains should result in a reduction of DNA breaks. To test this, we compared the cost and SOS induction in the RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutant and in an isogenic strain additionally carrying the most prevalent compensatory mutation found in our previous study:
RpoC Q1126K (40) . As hypothesized, both cost and SOS induction are greatly reduced in the compensated strain (Figure 2A ), confirming that DNA breaks are targeted by compensatory evolution. In order to test if this is general, we analyzed nine compensated clones from three independent populations of the RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutant propagated for fifteen days in the absence of antibiotics. As expected, the costs are smaller in the evolved strains and, as hypothesized, all the nine compensated clones show decreased SOS induction compared to their resistant ancestor ( Figure 2B ). This demonstrates that compensatory evolution widely targets mechanisms that reduce DNA breaks and further reinforces the notion that DNA breaks are major contributors to the cost of antibiotic resistance.
Increasing transcription-coupled DNA repair reduces the cost of resistance
We then hypothesized that, if DNA breaks contribute to the cost of resistance, enhancing DNA repair should reduce the cost. The RNA polymerase-binding transcription factor DksA has been recently shown to be involved in the transcription-coupled repair of DNA breaks (53, 54) . Thus, we hypothesize that overexpression of dksA should decrease the cost of resistance. As hypothesized, overproduction of DksA increases the fitness of the double resistant RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y , but not that of sensitive bacteria ( Figure S2A ), indicating that the relationship between DNA breaks and the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance is, indeed, causal.
Replication speed affects the cost of resistance Transcription-translation uncoupling can involve increased generation of replicationtranscription conflicts, which ultimately generate DNA breaks (42, 55) . Replication-transcription conflicts are maximized during fast replication, and less pronounced when bacteria grow slowly (56) .
Consequently, we hypothesized that the cost of resistance should be expressed mostly when cells are rapidly dividing. Indeed, we observed that, although the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are similar at 4h and 24h, these costs are generated in the first 4 hours (which comprise exponential growth), while resistance mutations show no cost afterwards, when growth slows down ( Figure 3A ). We therefore hypothesize that altering replication-transcription conflicts should affect the fitness cost of resistance.
To test that hypothesis, we influenced the occurrence of replication-transcription conflitcs through two strategies: negatively by growing our set of mutants in minimal medium, where DNA replication is slower (57) , or positively it by overexpressing the DNA replication initiator protein DnaA, which causes simultaneous initiation of multiple replication forks (58) . Our hypothesis predicts that DNA breaks should be reduced in minimal medium, where replication-transcription conflicts are less pronounced ( Figure 3B ). In agreement with our hypothesis, the SOS induction is smaller in minimal than in rich media ( Figure 3C , right panel), and the correlation with the cost is much weaker in minimal medium ( Figure S2B ). Coherently, the number of resistant mutants showing a fitness cost is smaller in minimal medium (8, compared to 13 in rich medium), with four of them even showing a higher fitness than sensitive bacteria ( Figure 3C , left panel). Moreover, some of the most costly mutations in rich medium (e. g. RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ) generate a much smaller cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ). Besides this general trend, however, there are resistant mutants (notably, those carrying the allele RpoB S531F ) that conserve or even increase their fitness cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ), evidencing the existence of additional factors contributing to the cost of resistance (such as the known defects in protein synthesis). Conversely, our hypothesis also anticipates that increasing the occurrence of replication-transcription conflicts by overexpressing DnaA should particularly affect resistant bacteria. As hypothesized, overexpression of dnaA severely compromises the viability of double resistant bacteria, whereas sensitive bacteria remains largely unaffected ( Figure 3D ). Altogether, these results demonstrate the involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the generation of the cost of antibiotic resistance, also corroborating the key contribution of DNA breaks to it.
Both transcription-translation uncoupling and replication-transcription conflicts lead to increased formation of R-loops, which cause DNA breaks (42,59) and exacerbate replicationtranscription conflicts themselves by impairing replication fork progression (60) . We thus reasoned that depleting RNase HI function, which specifically degrades R-loops (61), should lead to increased DNA breaks and greater costs of Rif R and Str R . Accordingly, both DNA breaks and the cost of resistance are greatly exacerbated in the ΔrnhA background ( Figure 4A , Table 1 , Figure S3 , Figure S4A ). Conversely, mild overproduction of RNase HI can ameliorate both phenotypes in a subset of mutants ( Figure S5 ); however, strong overproduction is toxic for the cell (62, 63) , irrespective of its genotype ( Figure S6 ).
These results confirm the involvement of R-loops in the uncoupling-mediated production of DNA breaks caused by resistance and suggest that RNase HI can be a target for manipulating the fitness of resistant strains in bacterial populations.
RNase HI can serve as a target specific against resistant bacteria The large effect of lacking RNAse HI function on the fitness of resistant bacteria prompted us to ask whether targeting it could be used to select specifically against resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations. RNase HI inhibitors are currently studied as antiretrovirals (64) . A commercially available one, RHI001, has been shown to inhibit the activity of purified E. coli RNase HI protein in vitro (65) .
In competitions between sensitive and resistant bacteria, we observed that addition of RHI001 to the medium increases the cost of most resistant mutants ( Figure 4B ), on average by 14%. RHI001 also reduces fitness of double resistant bacteria more than that of sensitive bacteria in the absence of competition ( Figure S4B and S4C). Chemical inhibition was not as effective as genetic removal (which increases cost on average by 28%) ( Figure 4C and D), as may be expected, since stability, diffusibility across the bacterial envelope, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RHI001 in vivo are unknown, and potentially suboptimal. Nevertheless, these results suggest that inhibiting RNase HI may be a plausible strategy to select specifically against resistant strains coexisting with sensitive bacteria, as long as resistant strains fail to evolve adaptations that abrogate their extinction. In order to test this hypothesis, we propagated a mixture of sensitive bacteria (CFP-labeled) competing against a pool of five single resistant mutants (YFP-labeled RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ) during 15 days, in the absence of antibiotics. We studied the frequency dynamics of resistant clones under both strong bottlenecks (1:1500 dilutions), where new adaptive mutations are less likely to spread, and weak bottlenecks (1:50 dilutions), where propagation of adapted clones is more probable.
In parallel, we performed identical propagations, but in which all strains lack RNase HI, as a proxy for optimal inhibition of RNase HI function. We observed that, in the presence of RNase HI, sensitive bacteria initially outcompete resistant clones but, as the propagation progresses, resistant bacteria increase in frequency -likely due to compensatory evolution -finally reaching coexistence ( Figure 5A Figure 5B ). Since the outcome of competitions under laboratory conditions can differ from those within the host (4,66), we next tested if inhibition of RNase HI would be an effective strategy in an animal model. We used the well-established mouse gut colonization model, which resembles the natural environment of many bacterial pathogens, including E. coli (67) . We colonized by oral gavage two cohorts of mice (each n=6): one with a 1:9 ratio mixture of CFP-tagged sensitive bacteria and a YFP-labeled double resistant strain [RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y , selected based on its ability to efficiently colonize the mammalian gut (68) ], and the other with an identical mixture but in which both strains are ΔrnhA. We then followed the frequency and absolute numbers [Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per gram of feces] of the resistant strain over time. Remarkably, when RNase HI function is intact, the double resistant strain persists in the gut of all animals at frequencies between 2.3 and 9.3% ( Figure 5C , blue lines) and high bacterial loads ( Figure 5D , blue lines) two weeks after gavage but, in the absence of RNase HI, resistant clones are rapidly outcompeted by sensitive bacteria ( Figure 5C and D, red lines). Indeed, resistant bacteria are driven to extremely low frequencies in as soon as 1 day postcolonization, and their extinction occurs in all the six mice in as soon as 5 days ( Figure 5C and D, red lines), demonstrating that RNase HI is a new target for efficiently eliminating resistant strains in the gut. Surprisingly, the absence of RNase HI does not lead to any detectable fitness defect in the sensitive bacteria, as the loads of E. coli are similar in the two cohorts of mice ( Figure 5E ). We then queried if the sequential application of an RNase HI inhibitor followed by an antibiotic could successfully eliminate the entire population of a potential gut pathogenic species composed of sensitive and resistant strains. In this scenario, we hypothesize that an antibiotic treatment should render completely different outcomes depending on the presence of RNase HI function. Indeed, a week-long treatment of streptomycin starting at day 16 after gavage enables resistant clones with intact RNase HI function to rebound and reach high loads (10 7 -10 8 CFUs/g feces), but it completely erradicates ΔrnhA bacteria in all the six mice ( Figure 5F ). These results demonstrate that RNAse HI function is not only a key determinant of the fitness of resistant bacteria, but also a potential co-adjuvant to eliminate undesirable bacteria in a natural environment for bacterial pathogens such as the mammalian gut. Altogether, these results show the enormous potential of targeting RNase HI as a promising antimicrobial therapy.
We show that mutations affecting transcription and translation generate DNA breaks, which explain 73% of the variation in their cost ( Figure 1 , Table 1 , Figure S1 ). Compensatory evolution indicates that these resistances cause uncoupling between transcription and translation (40) , which can result in DNA breaks (42). Indeed, we show that the RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutants, which combine alleles that cause increased transcription elongation rate (12) and decreased translation rate (26, 69) , show the highest costs and DNA breaks ( Figure 1 ). Curiously, inhibition of translation has been shown to alleviate the cost of Rif R mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36) . In light of the results presented here, this observation is compatible with a scenario in which Rif R mutations cause a perturbation of transcription-translation coupling by virtue of reduced RNA polymerase processivity, and translation inhibitors promote re-coupling by decreasing ribosomal activity. In agreement with the notion of single resistance mutations causing significant uncoupling, single Rif R or Str R mutations with high cost (70) cause a strong induction of the SOS response ( Figure   S7 ). We also showed that RNase HI is a key determinant of the fitness of resistant mutants ( Figure 4 , Table 1 , Figure S3 , Figure S4A , Figure S5 , Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint
We observed that replication-transcription conflicts contribute to the cost of resistance ( Figure   3 ), and that overproduction of DksA, involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair (53, 54) , reduces the cost of resistance ( Figure S2A ). Interestingly, DksA is also involved in preventing replicationtranscription conflicts (73) . Thus, prevention of the conflicts by DksA might also account for its beneficial effect on resistant bacteria, besides the enhancement of DNA repair. The involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the cost of resistance is coherent with previous observations, such as the small cost of specific Rif R and/or Str R alleles in minimal medium (24, 74, 75) or the outcompetition of sensitive bacteria by resistant mutants in aging colonies (76, 77) . Interestingly, stable DNA replication (initiation of DNA replication at sites different from OriC) can be induced by lack of RNase HI or by conditions that activate SOS (78) . Thus, Rif R and Str R mutations, which induce SOS This detrimental runaway loop, as well as the effects of the environment on the cost described above ( Figure 1A and Figure 3C ), could potentially be exploited therapeutically, via concurrent chemical and dietary treatments designed to synergistically maximize the cost of resistance.
We revealed RNase HI as a promising target specific against resistant bacteria (Figure 4 ), and showed that lack of RNase HI function favors extinction of resistant clones, preventing compensatory evolution ( Figure 5A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint mutations (80) or for pathogens that acquire antibiotic resistance exclusively through mutation, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which often carries Rif R and Str R mutations (81) . Interestingly, RNase HI has been proposed as an antimycobacterial target due to its essentiality in Mycobacterium smegmatis (82, 83) . The results presented here strongly support the plausibility of this strategy.
An understanding of the determinants of maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance, such as its cost, is urgently needed (1). We show that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance and reveal RNase HI as a promising antimicrobial target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validated under laboratory conditions, in the mammalian gut, and by using a repurposed drug. Overall, our results uncover important effects of resistances on bacterial physiology and demonstrate the plausibility of exploiting these effects to develop novel strategies against antibiotic resistance.

Resistant mutants additionally carry different chromosomal alleles conferring antibiotic resistance. The fluorescent constructions were generated by Lambda-Red recombineering (86) (87) (88) , followed by transference to a clean background by P1 transduction (89) , and subsequent transduction of the resistance alleles. The clean deletion of rnhA was constructed by markerless recombineering using a tetR-Ptet-ccdB-cat selection/counterselection cassette as described by Figueroa 
Fifteen independent colonies of sensitive bacteria were separately inoculated in LB in a 96-well plate, incubated at 37°C with shaking (700 r.p.m) for 7 hours, and 0.1ml of either independent culture was plated onto a LB agar plate supplemented with 150 µg/ml erythromycin, and incubated at 37°C for 5 days (Erm R strains grow in the presence of erythromycin, albeit slowly). Colonies able to grow in these plates were streaked onto plates supplemented with 150 µg/ml erythromycin, in order to further assess their bona fide resistance, and the rplD, and rplV genes of the resistant clones were amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger sequencing.
Early exponential cultures were diluted into pre-warmed medium containing the inducer of the Gam-GFP construction (anhydrotetracycline, 25 ng/ml) and incubated at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m.) for 3h, prior to imaging. Bacterial solutions were then placed onto 1% agarose (in 1X PBS) pads mounted in adhesive frames between the microscope slide and a coverglass. Images were acquired on an Applied Precision DeltavisionCORE system, mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, coupled to a Cascade II 1024x1024 EM-CCD camera, using an Olympus 100x 1.4NA Uplan SAPO Oil immersion objective, where GFP and mCherry were imaged with FITC (Ex: 475/28, EM: 528/38) and TRITC (Ex: 542/28, Em: 617/73) fluorescence filter sets, respectively, and DIC optics. Images were deconvoluted with Applied Precision's softWorx software, and prepared for presentation (cropping smaller fields to facilitate visualization, and false-coloring green and red fluorescent signals) using Fiji/ImageJ. All microscopy experiments were performed at the Imaging Facility of the IGC.

The next day, three independent colonies from each strain were inoculated separately in LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (150 µl per well) in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking (700 r.p.m).

SOS induction (top) and fitness cost (bottom), of sensitive bacteria (left), two single resistant mutants (center) and the double mutant combining these two alleles (right) in LB broth at 4h (A) or 24h (B) in a background harboring an additional chromosomal copy of the gene encoding the RNase HI (rnhA) under the control of the arabinose promoter, either in the absence (red bars) or the presence (white bars) of arabinose. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation of independent biological replicates (n=3). N.S. non-significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001 (two-tailed Student's t test).

Strong overproduction of RNase HI increases cost and SOS induction in all the backgrounds. SOS induction (top) and fitness cost (bottom), of sensitive bacteria (left), two single resistant mutants (center) and the double mutant combining these two alleles (right) in LB broth at 4h (A) or 24h (B) in a background harboring a plasmid carrying a copy of the RNase HI gene (rnhA) under the control of a promoter inducible by anhydrotetracycline, either in the absence (white bars) or the presence of different concentrations of the inducer (greyscale, from light grey to black bars). Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation of independent biological replicates (n≥2). N.S. non-significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001 (twotailed Student's t test).
