Background: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak with case-count time series from prior outbreaks to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak.
Methods: For short-and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short-and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott's rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes.
From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts.
Results: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872-1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874-1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876-933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877-983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013-2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone.
Conclusions: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.
Author summary
Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has been reported, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used an ensemble of models to estimate EVD transmission rates and to forecast the short-and long-term course of the outbreak. Our models project that a final size of roughly up to 300 additional cases is most likely, and estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under optimal levels of contact tracing and vaccination. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, is it not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. 4 30 and identified the initial epicenter to be Mabalako. This region of DRC (Fig 1) has 5 over five million inhabitants, some of whom suffer from armed conflict, humanitarian 6 crisis, and displacement to the bordering countries of Uganda and Rwanda [2]. Since 7 the outbreak began, its magnitude has surpassed all other EVD outbreaks in DRC, 8 becoming the second largest in history to date. As of February 25, 2019, 875 EVD cases 9 had been reported (65 probable and 810 confirmed), and the Ministry of Health of DRC, 10
During an Ebola outbreak, real-time forecasting has the potential to support 28 decision-making and allocation of resources, but highly accurate forecasts have proven 29 difficult for Ebola [8, 9] as well as other diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] . Highly accurate forecasts of 30 small, noisy outbreaks may be a fundamentally elusive ideal [14] . Previous work has 31 found that probabilistic forecasts can have relatively high accuracy within a few weeks, 32 though they become less useful as time horizons grow longer [15] . Thus, short-term against subsequently known counts. Although the epidemic was officially reported on 63 August 1 as a cluster of cases occurring in June and July, seven sporadic early cases 64 from April and May were subsequently linked to the current outbreak and were added 65 to later case totals [3] . This additional knowledge was added retrospectively to the time 66 series of cumulative case counts only for predictions made for days on or after 67 September 15, when these cases were officially linked to the current outbreak. 68 Stochastic model 69 We modeled Ebola virus (EBOV) transmission using a stochastic branching process 70 model, parameterized by transmission rates estimated from the dynamics of prior EVD 71 outbreaks and conditioned on agreement with reported case counts from the 2018 EVD 72 outbreak to date. We incorporated high and low estimates of vaccination coverage into 73 this model. We used this model to generate a set of probabilistic projections of the size 74 of simulated outbreaks in the current setting. This model is similar to one described in 75 previous work [16] , with the addition of a smoothing step allowing for a continuum of 76 transmission rates interpolated between those estimated from prior outbreaks. 77 On the assumption that past outbreaks provide a basis for projection of the current 78 outbreak, we used estimates of transmission rates from past EVD outbreaks to 79 parameterize simulations of the current outbreak. To estimate the reproduction number 80 R in past outbreaks as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the 81 outbreak, we included reported cases by date from fourteen prior outbreaks (Table S1 in 82 S1 Supporting Information), [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . To reflect the Ebola response system in DRC 83 during what is now its tenth outbreak, the first historical outbreak reported in each 84 country was excluded (e.g. the 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC), as there is a 85 difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD 86 following a country's first outbreak. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate 87 R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in these outbreaks [31] . The serial 88 interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 89 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest 90 whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD 91 cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days. Transmission rates estimated by day in these outbreaks tend to decline from initially 93 high to eventually low values, though they may display substantial fluctuations. This 94 "quenching" of transmission may be driven by formal interventions such as quarantine, or 95 by informal changes in individuals' behavior in response to the disease or by depletion 96 of uninfected contacts of infective individuals, or by other causes. We incorporated this 97 pattern into our model by estimating an initial reproduction number R initial and 98 quenching rate τ for each outbreak by fitting an exponentially quenched curve to the 99 outbreak's estimates of R by day d (Fig S2 in S1 Supporting Information), and used 100 these pairs of parameters, one from each past outbreak, to construct a joint distribution 101 of initial reproduction numbers and quenching rates for outbreak simulation. 102 We simulated EBOV transmission using a stochastic branching process model in 103 which the number of secondary cases caused by any given primary case is drawn from a 104 negative binomial distribution, whose mean is the reproduction number R as a function 105 of day of the outbreak, and variance is controlled by a dispersion parameter k [32, 33]. 106
All transmission events were assumed to be independent. The interval between date of 107 detection of each primary case and that of each of its secondary cases is assumed 108 gamma distributed with mean 14.5 days and standard deviation 5 days, rounded to the 109 nearest whole number of days, as above. 110 We used the (R initial , τ ) pairs estimated from prior outbreaks to provide R values for 111 simulation. R initial values were sampled uniformly from the range of values estimated 112 from past outbreaks. We applied a linear regression to the values of R initial and log(τ ) 113 estimated for prior outbreaks and used the resulting regression line to assign a mean τ to 114 each R, used with the residual variance of log(τ ) as a distribution from which to sample 115 τ values for simulation given R initial . Note that the range of fast and slow quenching 116 scenarios modeled in this way is not limited to the exact combinations estimated from 117 past outbreaks, but extends over a continuous distribution that includes those values. generated by the above branching process with the given parameters R initial , τ , and k, 125 and these were then filtered by discarding all proposed trajectories except those whose 126 cumulative case counts matched known counts of the current 2018 EVD outbreak on 127 known dates. In earlier, smaller data sets we filtered against all reported case counts, 128 while in later, more complete data sets we used a thinned series of case counts for 129 filtering, for computational tractability, by selecting five case counts evenly spaced in 130 the data set plus the final case count (Fig S1 in S1 Supporting Information). The 131 filtration required an exact match of the first target value, and at subsequent target 132 dates accepted epidemics within a number of cases more or less than each recorded 133 value. On the earlier data sets in which the beginning dates of the epidemic were 134 unknown, the first target value was allowed to match on any day, and subsequent target 135 dates were assigned relative to that day.
In order to produce model outbreak trajectories consistent with the case counts 137 reported more recently in the outbreak, it was necessary to make the filtering step of 138 the model more tolerant to variation in counts in order to accommodate the rapidly 139 rising count. This was because higher transmission rates in late September and early 140 October were necessary to generate case counts of that size than were consistent with 141 the earlier counts.
Thus this model embodies a set of assumptions that transmission rates are overall 143 gradually declining from the start of the outbreak to its end, though possibly with a 144 high level of variability in transmission rate between cases and between simulations.
When the tolerance of the filter on case counts is small, quenching of transmission 
We varied the tolerance as the data set became more complete to maintain a roughly 152 fixed rate of generation of filtered trajectories. As larger tolerances became necessary, in 153 data sets from after October, we introduced one further distinction: while it is possible 154 for cumulative case counts to decrease as inaccurately classified cases are removed from 155 the counts, due to the precision of the labeling of cases probable and confirmed we 156 March 20, 2019 8/36

This limit on underestimates was applied only to analysis of data sets from later 159 than October 13, to preserve unaltered the projection methods we reported in a 160 preprint of this paper [34] . Filtering tolerances were as follows: when using the August 161 20 data set, we allowed a tolerance of 4 cases more or less than each target count; for 162 August 27 and September 5, 6 cases; for September 15, 10 cases; for October 7, 12 cases; 163 for October 13, 17 cases; for November 1, 41 cases; for November 20, 55 cases; for The ring vaccination study found the vaccine to be effective against cases with onset 177 dates 10 days or more from the date of vaccine administration, so we modeled the 178 vaccination program as a proportionate reduction in the number of new cases with 179 onsets 10 days or more after the program start date. 180 We used past estimates of the proportion of unreported cases to estimate the 181 proportion of exposed individuals not covered by the vaccination process. Based on a 182 Sierra Leonean study from the 2013-2016 outbreak [37], we estimated the proportion of 183 reported cases (out of all known cases) in DRC to range from a low of 68% to a high of 184 96%, as extremes of the best known range of estimates, to be evaluated on their fit to 185 data. Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine 186 effectiveness, a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% × 64.6%) 187 and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% × 64.6%).

The 192 simulated outbreaks that were retained after filtering were continued until they 193 generated no further cases. Rare outlying simulated outbreaks that exceeded 300,000 194 cases were capped at the first value reached above that number, to limit unnecessary 195 computation. We used this ensemble to derive a distribution of final outbreak sizes, and 196 of cumulative counts at specific forecasting dates. Projection distributions were 197 constructed using kernel density estimation with leave-one-out cross-validation to 198 determine bandwidth, using a log-normal kernel for final sizes, due to the extended tail 199 of the values, and a normal kernel for all other estimates. We calculated median values 200 and 95% prediction intervals using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of simulated 201 outbreak size.

After model fitting and validation, the final 222 model chosen was a log-link regression for additional cases on the number of new cases 223 identified in the previous two and four weeks and the ratio of these two case counts.

The stochastic and negative binomial auto-regression models were scored based on The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/461285 doi: bioRxiv preprint and auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week 274 forecasts of outbreak size. As time lapsed, we compared predicted and known outbreak 275 sizes and found a higher probability of accurate forecasts at one week than at eight 276 weeks (Figs 2, 3) . Log-likelihood scores typically declined as projection times extended 277 further into the future. These lower-scoring longer-term projections tended to include 278 wider prediction intervals, reflecting less certain outcomes in which less probability was 279 assigned to any one value. The epidemic curve accelerated in early October, and 280 stochastic model forecasts occurring just before that change were especially low scoring, 281 as they failed to anticipate the coming rise in case counts. Subsequent projections took 282 into account the reported acceleration and their performance recovered. After our model validation process was completed, we used the stochastic and 284 auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week 285 outcomes (Figs 4, 5) . We used the Gott's rule and Theil-Sen regression models together 286 with the stochastic model to project final outbreak sizes (Figs 6, 7) .

The probability of a very large outbreak (10,000 or more cases) 299 was calculated to be below 8% for Gott's rule and negligibly small for the other models. 300 A final outbreak size of a catastrophic outbreak larger than the West Africa outbreak 301 (28,616 or more cases) was projected to have probability less than 3% by Gott's rule 302 and negligibly small for the other models (Table S2 in S1 Supporting Information). 303 We generated short-and long-term projections from earlier snapshots of the current 304 outbreak case counts with each model, for the purpose of both scoring and forecasting. 305
These additional results can be found in the Supplemental Material.
The stochastic model estimated likelihoods of the three scenarios of zero, low, and high 308 vaccination coverage, based on how often models using the different coverage 309 assumptions were able to pass the particle filtering step. In the estimate based on data 310 through February 25, vaccination coverage was estimated substantially more likely than 311 low or high coverage, as was also true in most earlier estimates. The lower vaccination 312 coverage scenario was estimated more likely than the higher one. Higher vaccination 313 coverage scenarios were estimated more likely in estimates made before October, at were concentrated in a range up to about 300 additional cases overall, and even the inaccurate. EVD has never before been introduced into a conflict zone with such present, the most reliable data source of EBOV transmission has been the weekly case 330 counts that can be found in the WHO situation reports. Despite such situations of data 331 scarcity and new outbreak circumstances, our models generated relatively accurate The mathematical models we adopted for this project near the beginning of the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/461285 doi: bioRxiv preprint outbreak. This may be a useful pattern for short-term forecasting of ongoing disease 359 outbreaks in real time.
The performance of our short-term prediction models can be assessed on the 361 outbreak to date. The relatively simple auto-regression model we used performed more 362 consistently on the range of partial data sets used for scoring than the more complex 363 stochastic simulation model did. The stochastic model has tended to produce tighter 364 prediction distributions that are prone to extreme failure when they get it wrong, while 365 the auto-regression model's predictions are more tolerant of unpredictable outcomes. However, we can note that our early projections of final size (Figs S9, S10 in S1 375 Supporting Information) fell below the counts that have been observed as of February. 376
In other words, our forecasts based on early reports and on an assumption that past 377 outbreaks can be used to forecast the present one were more optimistic than warranted 378 by subsequent events. Events to come may shed light on whether this outbreak is 379 qualitatively different than the past ones we have used to construct forecasts, perhaps 380 due to the impact of conflict conditions on the outbreak.
There are limitations to our projections. Projection distributions are right-skewed, 382 with long tails (and we therefore report the median instead of the mean). We were 383 unable to include all the 23 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten 384 cases in our estimates due to data availability. Our regression models are based entirely 385 on past outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (measured and reported in different ways), and 386 cannot account for the improved control measures and vaccination in the way that a outbreaks. The stochastic model used estimated vaccination effectiveness, reported 391 cases, and timing of onset dates affected by vaccination from studies from West Africa, 392 not DRC, and did not include vaccination of healthcare workers. Our forecasts do not 393 account for possible unreported cases or changes in reporting over time; such gaps in 394 reporting can not be ruled out, though given the intense efforts at case finding that 395 started in July and carried forward, we think it unlikely that there were large changes in 396 reporting. Furthermore, as the outbreak moved into areas affected by violent conflict as 397 the outbreak continued, we think it likely that case reporting, if anything, decreased Official reported case counts for each epidemic are given, including suspected cases ("Reported Count"). Case counts for the time series data included in the models include only probable and confirmed cases ("Time Series Count"). Case counts for historic outbreaks were pulled from publicly available literature [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Lastly, each historic outbreak's inclusion in the regression, stochastic, and auto-regression models is enumerated. *Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaïre)
We retained snapshots of the set of available case counts at multiple time points, for 572 use in scoring of retrospective model projections against known subsequent counts 573 (Fig S1) . In later data sets, due to the larger number of data points, a subset of the case 574 counts was selected for use in the stochastic model's particle filtering step, as noted in 575 the figure.
