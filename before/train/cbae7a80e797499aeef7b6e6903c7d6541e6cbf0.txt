As a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the Coronavirus 12 disease , it is important to characterize CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 13 peptidome that can trigger adaptive immune responses. Here, we use RosettaMHC, a comparative 14 modeling approach which leverages existing high-resolution X-ray structures from peptide/MHC 15 complexes available in the Protein Data Bank, to derive physically realistic 3D models for high-16 affinity SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We outline an application of our method to model 439 9mer and 17 279 10mer predicted epitopes displayed by the common allele HLA-A*02:01, and we make our 18 models publicly available through an online database (https://rosettamhc.chemistry.ucsc.edu). As 19 more detailed studies on antigen-specific T cell recognition become available, RosettaMHC 20 models of antigens from different strains and HLA alleles can be used as a basis to understand the 21 link between peptide/HLA complex structure and surface chemistry with immunogenicity, in the 22 context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 23 24 An ongoing pandemic caused by the novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become the 25 focus of extensive efforts to develop vaccines and antiviral therapies (1). Immune modulatory 26 interferons, which promote a widespread antiviral reaction in infected cells, and inhibition of pro-27 inflammatory cytokine function through anti-IL-6/IL-6R antibodies, have been proposed as 28 possible COVID-19 therapies (2, 3). However, stimulating a targeted T cell response against 29 specific viral antigens is hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of the immunodominant 30 epitopes displayed by common Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles across individuals 31 (public epitopes). The molecules of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I, or HLA 32 in humans) display on the cell surface a diverse pool of 8 to 15 amino acid peptides derived from 33 the endogenous processing of proteins expressed inside the cell (4). This MHC-I restriction of 34 peptide antigens provides jawed vertebrates with an essential mechanism for adaptive immunity: 35 surveillance of the displayed peptide/MHC-I (pMHC-I) molecules by CD8+ cytotoxic T-36 lymphocytes allows detection of aberrant protein expression patterns, which signify viral infection 37 and can trigger an adaptive immune response (5). A recent study has shown important changes in 38 T cell compartments during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6), suggesting that the 39 ability to quantify antigen-specific T cells would provide new avenues for understanding the 40 author/funder.

groove (termed A-F pockets) define a repertoire of 10 4 -10 6 peptide antigens that can be recognized 48 by each HLA allotype (9, 10). Several machine-learning methods have been developed to predict 49 the likelihood that a target peptide will bind to a given allele (reviewed in (11)). Generally these 50 methods make use of available data sets in the Immune Epitope Database (12) to train artificial 51 neural networks that predict peptide processing, binding and display, and their performance varies 52 depending on peptide length and HLA allele representation in the database. Structure-based 53 approaches have also been proposed to model the bound peptide conformation de novo (reviewed 54 in (13)). These approaches utilize various algorithms to optimize the backbone and side chain 55 degrees of freedom of the peptide/MHC structure according to an all-atom scoring function, 56 derived from physical principles (14-16), that can be further enhanced using modified scoring 57 terms (17) or mean field theory (18). While these methods do not rely on large training data sets, 58 their performance is affected by bottlenecks in sampling of different backbone conformations, and 59 any possible structural adaptations of the HLA peptide-binding groove. 60 Predicting the bound peptide conformation whose N-and C-termini are anchored within a fixed-61 length groove is a tractable modeling problem that can be addressed using standard comparative suggesting that a similar principle can be applied to produce models of candidate epitopes directly 72 from the proteome of a pathogen of interest. Here, we apply RosettaMHC to all HLA-A*02:01 73 epitopes predicted directly from the ~30 kbp SARS-CoV-2 genome, and make our models publicly 74 available through an online database. The computed binding energies of our models can be used 75 as an additional validation layer to select high-affinity epitopes from large peptide sets. As detailed 76 epitope mapping data from high-throughput tetramer staining (23-25) and T cell functional 77 screens (26) become available, the models presented here can provide a toehold for understanding 78 links between pMHC-I antigen structure and immunogenicity, with actionable value for the 79 development of peptide vaccines to combat the disease. 80 author/funder.

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 peptide epitopes 82 The SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2) were 83 obtained from NCBI and used to generate all possible peptides of lengths 9 and 10 (9,621 9mer 84 and 9,611 10mer peptides). We used NetMHCpan-4.0 (27) to derive binding scores to HLA-85 A*02:01, and retained only peptides classified as strong or weak binders (selected using the default 86 percentile rank cut-off values). The binding classification was performed using eluted ligand 87 likelihood predictions. While in this study we use NetMHCpan-4.0 predictions as inputs to select 88 candidate epitopes for structure modeling, our workflow is fully compatible with any alternative 89 epitope prediction method.

Inspection of Rosetta binding energies derived from models in this set 201 shows a similar distribution to the epitopes classified by NetMHCpan-4.0 as strong binders, with 202 the energies of 19/28 peptides falling well within the distribution of the refined PDB templates 203 (red dots in Figure 3e ).
Based on these observations, we further classified all epitopes in the original set provided by features for TCR recognition between different high-affinity epitopes (Figure 4) . We observe a 236 moderate electropositive character of the HLA-A*02:01 α 1 helix, and a moderate negative 237 potential on the α 2 helix, which is consistent between complexes with different bound peptides.
