Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. Because ZIKV uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack 36 of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains 37 derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that 40 ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-41 SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV. Our findings represent the first detailed mapping 42 of N-glycans on ZIKV E of various strains and their functional significance.

Recently, 47 the considerable increase in ZIKV infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, 48 especially after the outbreaks in Yap Islands (2007) 3,4 , French Polynesia (2013) 5,6 , Easter Island 49 (2014) 7 , and Brazil (2015) 8,9 . These ZIKV outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in 50 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and 51 paralysis of the limbs and face. In 2015, Zika spread to South and Central America, infecting 52 thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it was associated with an increase in GBS 53 rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities including spontaneous 54 abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental 55 insufficiency 10-14 . ZIKV is a small, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus 15 . The genomic RNA 56 of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 57 polyprotein 16,17 . This polyprotein undergoes co-and post-translational processing to produce 58 three structural proteins, which are capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), in 59 addition to seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 17,18 . 60 Of the three structural proteins, E is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (I, 61 II, III) and two transmembrane helices 17-19 . The majority of flaviviruses E proteins are post-62 translationally modified by N-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved 63 glycosylation motif of N-X-T/S at positions 154-156 (where X is any amino acid except proline) 64 16 . This is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry 20 .

Previously, it was demonstrated that the N-glycosylation sites on the E protein of flaviviruses are 66 highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 1) , playing a vital role in both infectivity and assembly 67 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

When produced in 103 C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells, these N-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by 104 sialylated glycans. For these four cell lines, bi-and tri-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3241.8 105 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on ZIKV E, followed by bi-sialylated bi-106 antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-glycans 107 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) . ZIKV E produced in SNB19 cells was also found to be decorated 108 with Man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated 109 bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-110 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). When expressed in the LLC-MK2 and JEG-9 cell lines, the 111 N-glycan profiles of MR766 and IbH strains of E were markedly different. When produced in 112 LLC-MK2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated 113 (1836.0 m/z) N-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (Supplementary Fig. 114 4a, b). More complex N-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine 115 repeats, were not identified in ZIKV E expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, the ZIKV E 116 produced in JEG-3 cells revealed a different N-glycosylation pattern between MR766 and IbH 117 strains. While the di-and tri-sialylated N-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the 118 most abundant for the MR766 ZIKV-E produced in JEG-3, the variety of N-glycans identified in 119 JEG-3 cells was greater, notably including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), Man 6 GlcNAc 2 (1784.0 120 m/z), Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (1988.1 m/z), Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 121 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycans (Supplementary Fig.   122 4a). In contrast, the IbH strain produced in the JEG-3 cells displayed a more restricted N-glycan 123 profile, with the notable absence of sialylated N-glycans and with the core fucosylated asialo-bi-124 All rights reserved.

Additionally, the E protein of PRVABC59 and FLR strains 129 expressed in C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cell lines were primarily decorated with tri-130 sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3603.0 m/z) and-with a lesser abundance-di-sialylated bi-131 and tri-antennary (2792.5 and 3241.8 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-132 glycans ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . Minor N-glycans including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), 133 monosialylated bi-antennary (2431.4 m/z), core-fucosylated mono-galactosylated bi-antennary 134 (2040.2 m/z), core-fucosylated asialo bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-135 sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-glycans were also identified ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . 136 Similar to the African lineage, the E proteins of Asian lineage revealed a more restricted N-137 glycan profile when expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. The di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) 138 N-glycan was identified as the most abundant N-glycan, with very low to no expression of more 139 complex N-glycans. The core-fucosylated agalactosylated (1836.0 m/z) and mono-sialylated bi-140 antennary (2431.4 m/z) were, respectively, the second and third most relatively abundant N-141 glycans reported (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . Lastly, the N-glycan profiles of the PRVABC59 142 and FLR strains of E expressed in JEG-3 cells showed a lower abundance of highly sialylated N-143 glycans such as the tri-and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3603.0 and 3964.2 m/z) 144 compared to the virus produced in the C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells. By contrast, the E 145 of the PRVABC59 strain showed an increased abundance of both mono-sialylated N-glycans 146 (2431.4 and 2880.6 m/z) and non-sialylated N-glycans (2040.2, 2070.2 and 2244 .3 m/z). 147 All rights reserved.

In both of these cell lines, the major N-glycans found were Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), 150 asialo-bi-antennary (2070.2 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-151 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . When produced in LLC-MK2 cells, however, the N-glycan 152 profile of the E protein from the SJRP strain was comparable to the profiles found for the four 153 other strains, with the di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.6 m/z) and the core-fucosylated 154 agalactosylated (1836.1 m/z) N-glycans being the most abundant. Contrasting the other E 155 proteins produced in C6/36, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells, Man5 (1579.9 m/z) was found to be the 156 most abundant N-glycan on the SJRP strain. However, the N-glycan profiles generated from the 157 E protein of SJRP strain expressed in THP-1, SNB19, and JEG-3 cells revealed a high relative 158 abundance of di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z), tri-antennary (3241.8 m/z), and tri-159 sialylated tri-antennary (3603.0 m/z) with little to no expression of less complex non-sialylated 160 N-glycans such as Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . 161 The major proportion (> 5%) of N-glycan spectra at 3603.0 mz, 3241.8 mz, 2792.6 mz, 3964.2 162 mz, 1836.0 mz, and 2040.2 mz were identified on ZIKV E produced in these cell lines. These 163 heterogenous N-glycan structures of the studied ZIKV E include high (oligo)-mannose; these and 164 other N-glycans compositionally are predicted to include the residues N-acetylgalactosamine 165 (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), galactose (Gal), 166 glucose (Glc), fucose (Fuc), and sialic acid. In addition, we found many other glycan forms with 167 high heterogeneity but smaller proportion (< 5%); these were not further characterized. These The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564542 doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 Cell-surface glycosylation strongly correlates with glycomic features of ZIKV E protein 171 In order to identify the general patterns of endogenous glycans in ZIKV-producing cell surface 172 endogenous glycoproteins, a lectin array was used. This approach relies on specificities of 173 immobilized lectins that recognize specific glycan features on cell surface glycoproteins, 174 resulting in their binding to the array. These data revealed that different cell lines harbor 175 differential cell-surface glycosylation (Fig. 3) that might impact the glycosylation of the virus 176 produced in these cells. In general, the expression of several cell-surface glycan structures 177 correlated with viral N-glycan features (Supplementary Table 3 ).

In this study, we used MS to 213 characterize the E protein N-glycans of ZIKV derived from insect cells and mammalian cells. 214 We showed for the first time that ZIKV E, which is required for host cell receptor binding, is 215 differentially glycosylated in a cell-type different fashion.

This has also been described for other viruses including ZIKV E, which were mostly decorated with bi-antennary di-sialylated and core-fucosylated 234 agalactosylated N-glycans ( Fig. 2-3, Supplementary Fig. 4) . Collectively, these findings 235 indicate that not only virus characteristics; e.g. strain or lineage, but also host cell physiology has 236 an impact on the glycosylation pattern of ZIKV E which may affect viral pathogenesis of ZIKV 237 strains.

In the current study, we did not determine the location of the N-glycans on ZIKV E protein. We 239 predict that the processed complex (mammalian-derived virus) or paucimannose (insect-derived 240 virus) glycan is at position N154 which is not essential for virus production and spread in 241 mosquito or mammalian cells 48 , as the high mannose-type N-glycans have been reported to be 242 present at the N154 residue in DI domain of ZIKV E within the conserved glycosylation motif 1, SNB-19 and JEG-3 cells ( Fig. 2-3, Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that decoration of 250 ZIKV E with sialylated N-glycans may correlate with diverse tissue tropism of the virus. Taken 251 together, these findings lead us to hypothesize that the "N-glycotype" of the recently emergent 252 Asian strains is mediating the incidence of the new neuropathogenic potential of ZIKV infection.
The results of our study revealed high heterogeneity in structure and composition of the N-254 glycans linked to ZIKV E produced by both insect and various mammalian cells including 255 monocytes, placental, and neural cell types. The heterogeneity of N-glycan has also been linked 256 to DENV E protein in terms of structure and composition 23 . The N-glycan on DENV E protein 257 that is produced by mammalian cells is a mixture of high-mannose glycan and complex glycan. Mosquito cells, by contrast, provide a mix of high-mannose glycan and paucimannose glycan 46 .

A large stock of ZIKV viruses were purified using sucrose cushion in ultracentrifugation as 380 described in previous methods 26 . Briefly, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 381 10 min, and a 0.45µm filter was used to remove cell debris. Virus-containing filtrate was layered 382 onto 20% (w/v) sucrose and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,715 × g, 4 °C for 3.5 hours.
Pellets were dissolved in 100 µl of NTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl and 384 1 mM EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid)). The purified virions were then resolved on 385 gradient 4-12 % bis-tris protein gels.
