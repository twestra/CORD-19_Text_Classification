Objective In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of 101 nonsurvivors with COVID-19 and analyze risk factors associated with the rapid disease progress to death after admission.
Design Retrospective study using electronic medical records.
Participants 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were included in this study.
We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data from electronic medical records. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with rapid disease progress to death after admission.
Among included nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 60 (59.4%) were men. Eighty-two (79.2%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), diabetes (21.8%) etc. Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (22.8%) were most common complications. Patients died within 3 days of admission were more likely to develop sepsis compared with those survived 3 days of admission. Higher heart rate and respiration rate, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count, elevated myoglobin level and depressed oxygen saturation on admission were associated with rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of admission. The AUCs for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.79), respectively.

Previous studies focused on clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients varied from mild, severe, even deceased cases. 6, 7 But the causes and risk factors associated with rapid disease progress to death need to be addressed further. In was identified according to previous report 12 . Acute cardiac injury was defined if the serum ultra-sensitive troponin I was above the 99th percentile upper reference limit 6 .
Sepsis and Septic Shock. 13 Characteristic chest computer tomography (CT) imaging of these nonsurvivors were evaluated by previously described method. 14 The primary outcome was organ injury or failure (including lung, heart, kidney and liver etc.) and risk factors for the rapid disease progress to death. Secondary outcomes were to present epidemiological and demographic data, comorbidities, signs and symptoms on admission, laboratory indicators, CT findings and treatments, and to compare the differences of patients died within 3 days with those survived 3 days of admission.
We expressed descriptive data as median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. We used Pearson's chi-square test, the Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test for comparisons between patients died within 3 days and those died after 3 days of admission, as appropriate. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with rapid death within 3 days of admission. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the performance of associated risk factors for rapid disease progress to death. were included in this study. The median age was 71.0 (IQR, 59.0-80.0) years. 60 (59.41%) were males. There were 57 (56.4%) cases whose age over 70 years (Table 1) .
The most common symptoms were fever (76.2%), cough (58.4%), dyspnea (54.5%), fatigue (37.6%) and diarrhea (9.9%). Other less common symptoms were anorexia (5.9%), nausea and vomiting (2.0%) and abdominal pain (1.0%) ( Table 1 ). The median duration from the onset of symptoms to admission and from admission to death were 9.0 (IQR, 5.0-13.0) days and 4.0 days (IQR, 2.0-7.0), respectively.
Forty-eight cases (47.52%) died within 3 days of admission, the median age was 72.0 (IQR, 59.0-78.0) years, 28 (58.3%) were male. Fifty-three cases (52.5%) died after 3 days of admission, the median age was 71.0 (IQR, 59.0-81.0) years, 32 (60.4%) were male. Compared with patients who survived 3 days, those died within 3 days of admission exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (25 vs 20 rpm, P=0.005) and heart rate (97 vs 84 bpm, P=0.006) on admission. There were no significant differences of self-report symptoms between two groups included fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue etc. (Table 1) . Among all the nonsurvivors, 81 (79.2%) patients had one or more underling medical conditions. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (58.4%), cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%), chronic pulmonary disease (14.9%), cerebrovascular disease (12.9%) ( Table 1 ). There is no significant difference on above mentioned comorbidities between who died within 3 days of admission and those survived 3 days of admission (Table 1) . All rights reserved.

We observed substantial abnormalities (below or over normal range) in laboratory findings of these nonsurvivors on admission. Inflammation was obvious and bacterial infection was suspected as shown by elevated neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels. Lymphpenia was obvious on admission as revealed by decreased lymphocyte count, especially decreased CD3 + T cells below normal range. Elevated levels of ultra-sensitive troponin I, myoglobin, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, decreased albumin level, depressed PaO2 and SpO2 demonstrated impaired organ functions of lung, heart, liver as well as coagulation disruption on admission (Table 2 ). There were several differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6. (Table 2) . Compared with patients survived 3 days of admission, those died within 3 days had longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040) and higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040). Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008) and higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042) compared with those died after 3 days which reflected poor oxygenation in these patients (Table 2) . Chest CT scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented vast or merged glass shadow, but quantification of lung injury revealed no significant difference between patients died within 3 days and those died after 3 days of admission (Table 2 and Figure 1 ).

As summarized in Table 4 , higher heart rate and respiration rate, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count, elevated myoglobin concentration and depressed oxygen saturation were associated with rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of admission. The AUCs for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.80) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.59-0.79), respectively. The best cut-off values for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 8.13×10 9 /L and 7.28×10 9 /L, respectively ( Figure 2 ). The AUCs of other indicators were with either poor sensitivity or specificity.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue etc. 6, 16 In our study, we observed that besides fever and cough, dyspnea (54.5%) presented early in most nonsurvivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. 17 Recent publication suggested the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission of deceased patients was 10.0 (IQR, 7.0-13.0) days, which tended to be longer than that of recovered patients (9.0 (6.0-12.0) days). 18 In our study, the median time from symptom onset to admission of patients died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission was 10.0 (6.0-13.0) days and 8.0 (4.0-14.0) days, respectively, but with no significantly difference between two groups. This indicated that although longer duration before admission might be associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients, it was not contributed to the rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of All rights reserved.

Abnormal laboratory findings on admission suggested impaired pulmonary, cardiac, liver and coagulation functions as well as disturbed immune function of these nonsurvivors even before hospitalization. ARDS was the most common complication in nonsurviving patients with COVID-19 and oxygen saturation was an important manifestation of ARDS. In our study, SpO2 of patients died within 3 days of admission was 85.0% on admission, which was significantly lower compared with those died after 3 days of admission. These suggested that PaO2 and SpO2 on admission might serve as early warning signals of poor prognosis and should attract more attentions. In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with little other organ failure. 19 In our study, it was noticed that 52.5% and 23.8% nonsurvivors suffered acute cardiac injury and AKI, respectively.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor, distributed widely in heart, kidney and intestine etc. 20, 21, 22 Whether SARS-CoV-2 attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly needs to be confirmed further. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, prolonged prothrombin time and remarkably increased D-dimer were noticed in patients died within 3 days of admission, which together with depressed platelet count indicated coagulation disturbance and tendency of disseminated intravascular coagulation in these patients.
Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support. 6, 24 In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the efficacy remains to be proved. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir and traditional Chinese medicine are still being verified in clinical trials. Application of glucocorticoid depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In our study, most nonsurvivors received high flow oxygen inhalation, but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients in early outbreak.
Univariate logistic regression analyses and ROC were conducted to assess risk factors and their performance associated with the rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of admission in COVID-19 patients. Previous study has demonstrated that old age was an independent risk factor for death of COVID-19 patients. 25 In our study, the median age of nonsurvivors was 71.0 year, this also suggested that old age was a critical factor for the death of COVID-19 patients, but it was not associated with the rapid disease progress to death. The AUCs for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.79), respectively.

In conclusion, the findings of this study suggested that older patients with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of patients.
