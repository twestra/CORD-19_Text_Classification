warmer spring and summer temperatures in north-temperate latitudes (Sajadi et al., 26 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , comparable to many viruses affecting human respiratory systems, 27 including SARS (Tan et al., 2005; Gaunt et al., 2010) . 28
However, recent (updated up to April 15, 2020; cf. Methods) data revealed the spread 29 of the epidemic across territories experiencing warm temperatures in the tropics (e.g. 30
Indonesia, Singapore, Brazil) and southern hemisphere as well (e.g. Australia, Argentina). 31
The current distribution of the epidemic challenges, therefore, the inference that SARS-CoV-32 2 may behave as a seasonal respiratory virus based on previous statistical analyses from 33 earlier realized distributions. 34
Here we examine the relationship between the apparent exponential rate of SARS-35
CoV-2 spread (ߛ) and the Effective Reproductive number (Rt) of infection and the average 36 daily temperature (T avg ) across nations and Chinese provinces where epidemics, with at least 37 100 case reported, have been reported (data updated up to 15th April, 2020). 38 The number of COVID-19 incidences follows the expected exponential growth, 53 although rates are only robust when cases exceed 100 persons for any country or province. 54
Hence, we fitted the exponential model to each country and each province of China. We 55 calculated exponential rate parameters for the countries where the COVID-19 incident has at 56 least a 10-day growth period, and the total number of cases was at least 100. 57
Where N is the cumulative number of diagnosed persons and Days is the number of days and 60 ߛ is the exponential rate (100 x ߛ = % increase per day). 61
To calculate the effect of temperature on the exponential rate parameter, we first 63 regressed the exponential rate parameters retrieved from the exponential model on ܶ ݁ ݉ ‫‬ and 64
If the squared term is significant, it provides evidence of nonlinearity. 66
The thermal performance of COVID-19 was characterized by fitting spread rate estimate or 67 growth parameter (ߛ) and temperature to the Gaussian function; 68

with an average of 9.82± 0.39 % day -1 (Figure 1, Figure S1A ), and apparent Rt of 1.27 ± 0.02 93 ( Figure 1, Figure S1A) . Surprisingly, ߛ and Rt across Chinese provinces (mean ± SE = 1.3 ± 94 0.28 % day -1 and 0.96 ± 0.02) ( Figure S1B) were well below those of other nations (mean ± 95 SE = 19.82± 0.39 % day -1 and 1.27 ± 0.02), possibly because much faster confinement of the 96 Chinese population did not allow for the potential exponential rates under uncontrolled 97 conditions to be realized.

The relationship between ߛ and Rt and T avg shows no evidence for a reduced spread 101 rate with warming (Figure 1) , unlike analyses based on previous data. A number of nations 102 with T avg > 20 o C, including subtropical and tropical (Brazil, Cuba, UAE, Saudi Arabia, India 103 and Panama), and southern-hemisphere (Peru, Argentina, Indonesia) nations (Figure 2) , 104 support ߛ and Rt above the median values of 9.6% day -1 and 1.23, respectively (Figure 1 ). 105 However, the same analysis conducted one weeks ago (15th March), did provide some 106 evidence for low ߛ and Rt for T avg > 20 o C ( Figure S2 ). Our updated results (Figure 1) show, 107 however, that this apparent temperature-dependence was confounded with a prevailing zonal 108 pattern of spread across the north-temperate zone, possibly reflecting the main patterns of 109 human mobility, which delayed arrival of the epidemics to the southern hemisphere and the 110 tropics. 111
These results suggest that, contrary to prior assessments, the spread rate of the 113 COVID-19 pandemic is temperature-independent, it is transmitting in countries with warm 114
weather. This signifying that there is little hope for relief as temperatures in the northern 115 hemisphere increase, and that poor nations with weak health systems in tropical regions, such 116 as African, are at great risk. Therefore, in order to reduce transmission, it's important to 117 employ strong lockdown, social distancing and testing and tracking polices. 118 119 Data sources: The data on COVID-19 is available publicly across many sources; where 120 downloadable data files are updated daily few are listed below; 121
