26 Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-27 related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize 28 MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of 29 MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 45 prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin. 46 47 All rights reserved.

Existing evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may be originated from bats. In particular, 49
Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein was shown to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human 50 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To better understand the potential infectivities of MERS-CoV in 51 bats, we developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris 52 pachypus and Rhinolophus sinicus (host of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 and SARS-related-53
CoV respectively). MERS-CoV demonstrated much broader cellular tropism than SARS-CoV 54 and HCoV-229E, being able to infect five cell lines, including R. sinicus but not T. pachypus 55 cells. The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and human DPP4 genes supported the 56 ability of MERS-CoV to infect bat cells, while DPP4 expression appeared critical for MERS-57
CoV replication. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV 58 susceptibility in T. pachypus cells. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV may reflect the 59 host diversity of MERS-CoV-related viruses and offers insights into its ancestral origin. 60 61 All rights reserved.

were determined for six of the seven bat species from which the 12 tested bat cells were 154 developed. The sequence of M. pusillus was not determined, as RT-PCR for the DPP4 mRNA 155 from bat cells was negative. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bat DPP4 mRNA sequences 156 formed a distinct cluster being closely related to sequences from human and non-human MERS-CoV spike protein (64, 65). Upon multiple sequence alignment of the corresponding 160 regions that contain these critical residues, most of the residues are conserved in the six bat 161 DPP4 sequences in this study (Fig. 3B) The broader cellular tropism of MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E in bat 206 cells may reflect the host diversity of lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats.

SARSr-CoVs in bats were shown to 210 utilize the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), for cell 211 entry (67). Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E is likely to have originated from bats. CoVs 212 closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected in bats of the genus Hipposideros in Africa 213 (68). More recently, CoVs even closer to HCoV-229E were identified in dromedary camels in 214 the Middle East, which were able to utilize the receptor of HCoV-229E, human aminopeptidase 215 N (hAPN) for cell entry (69). This suggests that dromedary camels may have served as 216 intermediate hosts for bat-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E, which may be analogous to 217 the evolution of MERS-CoV. Recently, a CoV, closely related to HCoV-NL63 in most genome 218 regions except the spike protein, was detected from a bat of the genus Triaenops in Kenya (70). 219 However, further studies are required to identify even closer relatives of HCoV-NL63 to 220 ascertain its possible bat origin. In contrast to SARSr-CoVs and HCoV-229E which were 221 mainly found in horseshoe and roundleaf bats respectively, a more diverse host range was 222 observed in lineage C betacoronaviruses. Yet, the different bat species harboring lineage C 223 betacoronaviruses all belonged to the family Vespertilionidae. Specifically, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, 224 including cells from Hipposideros. This may suggest a relatively narrow host range of SARS-231
CoV and HCoV-229E in bats compared to lineage C betacoronaviruses including The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and primate DPP4 sequences may 233 reflect the replicative ability of MERS-CoV in bat cells. Moreover, cells that supported MERS-234
CoV replication showed significantly higher DPP4 mRNA expression than those that were non-235 susceptible to MERS-CoV, suggesting that cellular DPP4 expression is critical for viral 236 infection. Since Ty-BatCoV HKU4 from T. pachypus was previously shown to be able to utilize 237 hDPP4 for cell entry (52, 53) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
