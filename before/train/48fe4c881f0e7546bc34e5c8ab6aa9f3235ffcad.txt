Fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology remain to be described, having the 20 potential to provide insight to the response effort for this high-priority pathogen. Here we 21 describe the first native RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing the coronaviral 22 transcriptome and epitranscriptome, and share these data publicly. A data-driven inference 23 of viral genetic features and evolutionary rate is also made. The rapid sharing of sequence 24 information throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an inflection point for public 25 health and genomic epidemiology, providing early insights into the biology and evolution of 26 this emerging pathogen. 27 28 29
Aspects of the response assume that the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable with 49 previously characterised coronaviruses, including the annotation of genes and the estimation 50 of molecular evolutionary rates [11] [12] . It remains highly relevant to determine these 51 features experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, potentially revealing other insights 52 into the biology of this emergent pathogen. To address this, here we describe (i) the first 53 native RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing the coronaviral transcriptome and proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10). The subgenomic mRNAs have a common 5′ leader 65 sequence, near-identical to that located in the 5′-UTR of the viral genome; the transcription 66 mechanism repositions the 5′ leader sequence upstream of ORFs, with each translation 67 start site being located at the primary position for ribosome scanning. These ORFs, although 68 annotated, are yet to be shown as expressed experimentally. Standard sequencing 69 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To define the architecture of the coronaviral transcriptome, a recently established direct RNA 75 sequencing approach was applied, using a highly parallel array of nanopores [16] . In brief, 76 nucleic acids were prepared from cell culture material with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 77 growth, this being expected to include examples of both genomic mRNA and transcripts 78 corresponding to each ORF. These were sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 79 including poly(T) adaptors and an R9.4 flowcell on a GridION platform (Oxford Nanopore 80 Technologies). Through this approach, the electronic current is measured as individual 81 strands of RNA translocate through a nanopore, with derived signal-space data basecalled 82 to infer the corresponding nucleobases. As a comparator, virion material of SARS-CoV-2 83 was also prepared and sequenced through this approach, with complete viral genome 84 sequences expected to predominate rather than subgenomic transcripts.
The cellular-derived material was used to generate 680,347 reads, comprising 860Mb of 87 sequence information (BioProject PRJNA608224). Aligning to the genome of the cultured 88 SARS-CoV-2 isolate (MT007544.1), a subset of reads were attributed to coronavirus 89 sequences (28.9%), comprising 367Mb of sequence distributed across the 29,893 base 90 genome. Of these, a number had lengths >20,000 bases, capturing the majority of the 91 SARS-CoV-2 genome on a single molecule. This direct RNA sequencing approach 92 generated an average 12,230 fold coverage of the coronaviral genome, biased towards 93 sequences proximal to the polyadenylated 3' tail; coverage ranged from 34 fold to >160,000 94 fold ( Figure 1B) , reflecting the higher abundance of subgenomic mRNAs carrying these 95 sequences, as well as the directional sequencing from the polyadenylated 3' tail. The virion 96 material generated fewer reads, and included a calibration standard added during library 97 preparation (430,923 reads, BioProject PRJNA608224).
Many features of SARS-CoV-2 biology are captured in these direct RNA sequence data, 100 including the transcriptome, as well as RNA base modifications or 'epitranscriptome'. To 101 define the transcriptome, the shared 5' leader sequence was used as a marker to identify 102 intact transcripts, these corresponding to subgenomic mRNAs and having a low abundance 103 in the virion-derived data ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2) .

In SARS, ORF7a and ORF7b are encoded on a shared subgenomic mRNA, with 107 translation of ORF7b being achieved through ribosome leaky scanning, explaining the 108 absence of a dedicated ORF7b-encoding subgenomic mRNA [17] . There is however no 109 satisfactory explanation for the absence of an ORF10-encoding subgenomic mRNA. 
This Bayesian approach demonstrated improved precision in estimates of evolutionary rates 171 using our dataset with highest genetic diversity. This may be explained by the stochastic 172 variation typical in data from early in an outbreak having a smaller impact as the virus 173 accumulates genetic variation.

Subgenome bins were refined to remove reads which did not originate at the 3' poly-A tail as 513 expected for intact subgenomic mRNAs, or which had leader sequences at least 10bp 514 longer than expected. Subgenome bins were re-aligned, with coverage calculated in 515 SAMtools [M4], and plotted using ggplot2 [M5] in R [M6] . Breakpoints in mRNAs were 516 determined with CIGAR string manipulation; any given spliced region longer than 100bp 517 (represented by Ns in the CIGAR string after aligning with minimap2) was regarded as a 518 spliced transcript and the 5' and 3' genome co-ordinates of the breakpoint were recorded for 519 analysis. The IPKnot webserver [M7] was used to predict the RNA secondary structures, 520 and the VARNA visualization applet [M8] to produce schematics.
As an alternate method of defining the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, reads carrying a 523 breakpoint relative to the 5' leader sequence are shown, representing potentially viable 524 transcripts. This was determined through CIGAR string manipulation. Any spliced region Table   564 3). A third maximal diversity dataset (n=100) was included to demonstrate the utility of 565 author/funder.

Temporal signal was assessed using BETS [M15] .
Initially we determined whether the evolutionary signal and time over which the genome data 569 were collected was sufficient to calibrate the molecular clock, allowing for the evolutionary 570 rate and timescale of the outbreak to be inferred. The model selection approach from BETS 571 supported a strict molecular clock model with genome sampling times for calibration and a 572 coalescent exponential tree prior, which posits that the number of infected individuals grows 573 exponentially over time. We used the HKY+Γ substitution model, and set the following priors 574 for key parameters: 
A root-to-tip regression usually produces lower evolutionary rate estimates than explicit 586 phylogenetic methods [M25], although is commonly used to inspect temporal signal in the 587 data. In our analyses, the data set that maximised phylogenetic diversity had a higher R 2 588 than that with 122 samples collected earlier, and an evolutionary rate that was more similar 589 to that obtained in BEAST. Although, both data sets had temporal signal according to BETS, 590 the root-to-tip regressions demonstrate that including more genetic diversity can produce 591 improved estimates, probably because stochastic variation has a stronger impact in smaller 592 data sets that are collected early in the outbreak. 598 599 author/funder.
