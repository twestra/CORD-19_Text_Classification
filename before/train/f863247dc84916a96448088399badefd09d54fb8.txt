Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor 2 binding in a new host. Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already 3 harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that 4 additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming 5 host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that 6 the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate 7 infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show 8 that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human 9 lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike 10 does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike 11 receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera.
Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a 13 second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of 14 the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs.
Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate 16 emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic 17 CoV strains.

Importance
Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a 20 subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding 21 and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating 22 the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also 23 offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue 24 that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence 25 events in humans.
Since the beginning of the 21 st century, public health infrastructures have been required 28 to periodically respond to new and reemerging zoonotic viral diseases, including influenza, 29 Ebola, and Zika virus outbreaks (1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS- 
Despite their spontaneous emergence, several research approaches to rapidly respond 37 and even predict outbreak strains already exist. During the MERS-CoV outbreak, our group and 38 others were able to leverage reagents generated against related group 2C coronaviruses, 39 HKU4-and HKU5-CoV (6, 7). These reagents, created independent of viable virus replication, 40 provided valuable insights and models for testing serologic responses during the early stages of 41 the MERS-CoV outbreak. Similarly, reverse genetics systems permitted the exploration of 42 zoonotic coronaviruses (8); using the known SARS spike/ACE2 receptor interaction, chimeric 43 viruses containing the backbones of bat CoVs were generated to evaluate the efficacy of both 44 vaccines and therapeutics (9-12). The inverse approach placed the zoonotic spike proteins in 45 the context of the epidemic SARS-CoV backbone (13, 14) . These studies provided insight into 46 potential threats circulating in bats as well as the efficacy of current therapeutic treatments (15).
While far from comprehensive, the results indicated that these approaches, reagents, and 48 predictions may prove useful in preparations for future CoV outbreaks.
In this study, we extend examination of zoonotic viruses to a novel MERS-like CoV strain 50 isolated from a Ugandan bat, PDF-2180 CoV (MERS-Uganda).

Utilizing the MERS-CoV infectious clone (17), we previously attempted to evaluate the potential 69 of the PDF-2180 CoV to emerge from zoonotic populations. Replacing the wild-type MERS-CoV 70 spike with the PDF-2180 spike produced a virus capable of generating viral transcripts in vitro,
but not sustained replication (16). These results suggested that the significant amino acid 72 differences observed within the receptor-binding domain precluded infection of Vero cells.
However, amino acid changes were not confined only to the receptor-binding domain (RBD); 74 highlighting changes between the Uganda spike on the MERS-CoV trimer revealed significant 75 differences throughout the S1 region of spike ( Fig. 1A & B) . While the S2 remained highly 76 conserved (Fig. 1C) , changes in the C-and N-terminal domains of S1, in addition to the RBD, 77 may also influence entry and infection compatibility. Notably, recent reports had also indicated 78 differential protease cleavage of wild-type MERS-CoV based on cell types, suggesting that

The requirement for trypsin 84 complicated these studies due to cell toxicity; to overcome this issue, we utilized both trypsin-85 adapted Vero cells and a MERS-Uganda chimera encoding RFP in place of ORF5, similar to a 86 previously generated MERS-CoV reporter virus (17). Following MERS-Uganda infection, 87 cultures with trypsin containing media showed evidence for replication of viral genomic RNA 88 (Fig. 1E) . Similarly, the nucleocapsid protein was only observed in the presence of exogenous 89 trypsin following infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera (Fig. 1F) . Notably, wild-type MERS-
