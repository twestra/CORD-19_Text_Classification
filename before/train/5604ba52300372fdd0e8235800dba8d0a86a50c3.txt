No clinically proven effective antiviral strategy exists for the epidemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 .
We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days.
The epidemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 started in Dec. 2019. As of Apr. 8, 2020, the WHO reported 1,452,178 confirmed cases across more than 130 countries with a global mortality rate of 5.8%. 1, 2 At the moment, no specific treatment exists for COVID-19. Standard practice of care focus on treating the clinical symptoms (pyrexia, cough, and acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS)) of patients with supportive care such as fluid management and auxiliary oxygen therapy. No proven clinical efficacy of antiviral agent for COVID-19
were reported, whilst some of them (Remdesivir, hINFa-2b, Ribavirin, Chloroquine and Arbidol) are currently under clinical trials for COVID-19. 3, 4 SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses exhibit similar disease presentations with similar organ trophism. Because both viruses are RNA virus depending on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate, the RdRp inhibitor Arbidol (common name for Umifenovir) approved for influenza in Russia and China has been proposed as a standard care option for COVID-19, mainly based on its mechanism-of-action (MoA) and its effects in treating influenza-associated pneumonia. [5] [6] [7] Favipiravir, an antiviral drug targeting RdRP, 8 approved in Japan for influenza, has an IC50 of 0.013-0.48 ug/ml for influenza A. Comparing this with the EC50 of 2.7-13.8 ug/ml of Arbidol, 9 we consider Favipiravir might serve as a potential candidate to treat COVID-19. Specifically, we hypothesized that Favipiravir would be superior to Arbidol in terms of improving clinical recovery rate at Day 7, and alleviating pyrexia, cough, and ARDS.

Patients were assessed for eligibility on the basis of: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2) voluntarily provided informed consent; (3) initial symptoms were within 12 days; (4) Diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia. According to the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia at that moment, 10 severe or critical types of COVID-19 were eligible. Patients were excluded if they meet any of following criteria: (1) allergic to Favipiravir or Arbidol; (2) with elevated ALT/AST (>6x upper limit of normal range) or with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis at grade Child-Pugh C); (3) severe/critical patients whose expected survival time were <48 hours; (4) female in pregnancy; (5) HIV infection; or (6) considered unsuitable by researchers for the patient's best interest. Written informed consents were obtained from all patients or their authorized representatives if the patient was unable to write physically.

The axillary temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation without supportive oxygen, usage of oxygen therapy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) were recorded in daily follow-up. Repeated measurements were made at least twice in each follow-up. The measurements were taken after 15 minutes rest at room temperature (23±2°C). Adverse events and concomitant medication were observed.
The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at 7 days from the beginning of treatment. Clinical recovery was defined as continuous (>72 hours) recovery of body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and cough relief after treatment, with following quantitative criteria: axillary temperature ≤ 36.6°C; respiratory frequency ≤ 24 times/min; Oxygen saturation ≥ 98% without oxygen inhalation; mild or no cough.
Secondary outcomes included the latency to pyrexia relief (for patients with pyrexia at the time of enrollment), the latency to cough relief (for patients with moderate or severe cough at the time of enrollment), the rate of AOT or NMV, all-cause mortality, dyspnea, rate of respiratory failure (defined as SPO 2 ≤ 90% without oxygen inhalation or PaO 2 /FiO 2 <300mmHg, requires oxygen therapy or additional respiratory support), and the rate of patients needed to receive intensive care in ICU.

With a limited knowledge of the efficacy for Arbidol, we assumed a 50% clinical recovery rate at Day 7 for the Arbidol group. A superior clinically efficacy of Favipiravir was then expected to be at least 70%. With Bilateral 95% CI of the difference between the clinical recovery rate of the experimental group and the control group was calculated. If the lower limit was larger than 0, it was considered the experimental group is superior to the control group. Log rank test was used to compare the recovery latency between the two groups. For secondary outcomes, student's T-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test (if T-test was not applicable) was performed for safety indicators and continuous variables, Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for grade variables. Frequency or composition (%) were used for statistical description of categorial variables, and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison between groups. For all statistical tests, P<0.05 (bilateral) were considered as statistically significant.

A total of 240 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, in which 236 took at least one dosage of drug were considered as the full analysis set (FAS) (Figure S1 -S2). The FAS set includes 116 in the Favipiravir group and 120 in the Arbidol group (Table 1 Main signs and symptoms for enrolled patients were pyrexia, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, expectoration, sore throat, diarrhea, dizziness, insomnia and conjunctivitis, none of which were significantly different between groups. There was no difference between the time from onset of patient symptoms to time of treatment initiation between groups. Neither the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, lymphocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein differed between groups (Table 1) . 116 cases in Favipiravir group and 119 in Arbidol group underwent chest CT, in which 112 (96.55%) and 114 (95.80%) were diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia according to the diagnostic criteria (P=0.7635). Overall, no significant difference of basic characteristics of patients between the two groups was observed. However, we noticed a marginally increased ratio of severe to critical patients in the Favipiravir group (16 (severe)+2 (critical)) compared to Arbidol group (8+1) (P=0.0658, Fisher's All rights reserved.

Hence, we conclude that for secondary outcomes, Favipiravir significantly shortened the latency to relief for cough and pyrexia.

During this trial, we detected 37 incidences of antiviral-associated adverse effects (AE) in the Favipiravir group and 28 incidences in the Arbidol group. All observed AE incidences were level 1. Favipiravir was associated with increased serum uric acid (3 (2.50%) in Arbidol group vs 16 (13.79%) in Favipiravir group, P=0.0014). No statistical difference was observed for the frequency of abnormal ALT/AST, psychiatric symptom reactions or digestive tract reactions ( Table 4 ). Most of these adverse reactions disappeared by the time patients being discharged.

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, randomized superiority clinical trial and hypothesized that Favipiravir would be superior to Arbidol in terms of efficacy for moderate symptoms, and would accelerate the clinical recovery of pyrexia, cough, and breathing difficulties compared with Arbidol. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine and antiviral drugs is more common in China, which is due to the traditional medical culture background of the treatment All rights reserved.

Also, anti-infection and immune regulation play an important role in the treatment of the COVID-19. Ancillary treatments, such as traditional Chinese medicine, anti-infection and immunomodulatory drugs, were without statistical difference between groups (Table S2) .
Our trial has several limitations. Firstly, for COVID-19, there is no clinically proven effective antiviral drug to serve as the control arm. Although Chinese guideline had recommended several options including Arbidol, 11 no RCT results on these drugs were reported. Arbidol was widely used by Chinese doctors in the beginning stage of this epidemic of COVID-19 (Jan. 1-30, 2020) based on in vitro evidence. 12 For ethical reasons, we chose Arbidol for the control arm. Secondly, observation time frame was limited due to the urgency of this epidemic. For the same reason, no relapse (including nucleic acid conversion, pyrexia, cough, or pneumonia progress by radiology) tracking were performed for the discharged patients. Thirdly, in the inclusion criteria, we did not force positive nucleic acid test as a necessity. The accuracy of nucleic acid assay was limited, which might due to multiple reasons including previous treatment, latency of onset, sampling method, biological specimen characteristics. This particular accuracy problem was a known issue among clinical practitioners across the world. It was estimated that the assay might have at most 30%-50% of sensitivity for patients in early stage of the disease, whilst contact history, clinical manifestations, radiology evidences, and lab results including leukopenia and lymphopenia could be confirmatory for these nucleic-acid-negative pneumonia patients. In the Chinese guideline, 11 patients meeting these criteria were considered as All rights reserved.

In this trial, 46.55% patients in Favipiravir group and 38.33% in Arbidol group were nucleic-acid-positive at enrollment.
Considering the population incidence of COVID-19 infection at the time of this trial in Wuhan, we consider the probability for mis-identifying patients of pneumonia disease other than COVID-19 into this trial is low. Fourthly, the protocol does not prespecify clinical classification as a stratification factor. Ethical concerns arose against completely excluding severe/critical cases from potential beneficial treatment.
Additionally, because of the complexity of the disease, progression from moderate to severe/critical is possible. Terminating trial treatment to such patients from the study was considered unacceptable. Post-hoc analysis showed that both treatment and clinical classification contributed significantly to the primary outcome of clinical recovery rate at Day 7. Difference of the frequency of severe/critical patients between groups reached a marginal significance, which made an important impact on the trial outcome.

Compared to Arbidol, Favipiravir does not significantly improve clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Favipiravir is associated with significantly shortened latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Antiviral-associated adverse effects of Favipiravir are mild and manageable.
