Background: The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 30 2 (SARS-COV-2) has caused more than 2.5 million cases of Corona Virus Disease 31 in the world so far, with that number continuing to grow. To control the 32 spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate 33 quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the gold 34 standard but is time-consuming with significant false negative results. Therefore, 35 alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based 36 on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial 37 Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific 38 graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus 39 saving critical time for disease control.
40 Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed 41 COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical 42 viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to 43 establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal 44 validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity 45 of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with 46 specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that 47 first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 48 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. : medRxiv preprint 65 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic 66 acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the 67 algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. Our study represents the first study to apply 68 artificial intelligence to CT images for effectively screening for COVID-19.
