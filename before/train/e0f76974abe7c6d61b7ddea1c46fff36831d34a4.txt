A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible 31 for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan 1-4 . Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism-based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral 44 activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, 45 which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to 46 new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high-throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID-19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular 65 weight of COVID-19 virus M pro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, 66 consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its 67 enzymatic activity and to carry out high-throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed 68 a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled 69 substrate, MCA-AVLQ↓SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-70 cleavage sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent
kinetic analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for COVID-19 72 virus M pro was measured to be 28,500 M −1 s −1 which is slightly higher than that for SARS- 73 CoV M pro (kcat/Km=26,500 M −1 s −1 ) 10 , but over 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus 74 3C protease (kcat/Km=920 M −1 s −1 ) 11 .
In a previous study, we designed a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 using computer-aided 77 drug design (CADD) (Extended Data Fig. 1c) , which can specifically inhibit multiple CoV utilized to evaluate the inhibition as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate be 11,300±880 M -1 s -1 , suggesting this Michael acceptor has potent inhibition. 95 The crystal structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 96 In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this compound, we determined the crystal 97 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 to 2.1-Å resolution. The asymmetric 98 unit contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data Table 1 ). However, two of these 99 associate to form a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (the two molecules 100 are designated protomer A and B) (Fig. 1b) . All residues (residues 1-306) are visible in 101 electron density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a) . Domains Ⅰ 102 (residues 8-101) and Ⅱ (residues 102-184) have an antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain 103 Ⅲ
(residues 201-303) contains five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular 104 cluster, and is connected to domain Ⅱ by means of a long loop region (residues 185-200). strand155-168 on one side, and with residues 189-191 of the loop linking domains Ⅱ and Ⅲ
. 111 Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with M pro (Fig. 1c, d) . The electron density 112 shows that the Sγ atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-Å) with the Cβ of the vinyl 113 group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute 114 requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-115 A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved 116 in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-118 A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which 119 consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the 120 side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this the S1′ site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3 126 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding 127 pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket. conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 133 structure, which makes a long-distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the 134 ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side 135 chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV M pro s share a highly 136 conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design 137 of broad-spectrum inhibitors 12 . The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of 138 structural data for CoV M pro s from various species provided the opportunity to further 139 examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of M pro s 12-21 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain Ⅲ and surface loops, but the 141 substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains Ⅰ and Ⅱ are still highly 142 conserved among all CoV M pro s, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should 143 have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c) . μM.

Cell-based 211 phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable 30 , but the complexity of this approach is 212 not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and it cannot identify the molecular 213 target or mechanism of action 31 . In this study, the convergence of structure-based ab initio 214 drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening proved to be an efficient 215 strategy to find antiviral leads against COVID-19 virus.
