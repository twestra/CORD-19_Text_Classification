RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels.

The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.
Targeted inhibition of a metabolism regulatory gene is often used for modeling and developing therapies of metabolic diseases (Moller, 2012; Saviano and Baumert, 2019) . In the past decades, many strategies of metabolic regulations were achieved through using various modulators, including numerous small molecular compounds, nucleic acids, and therapeutic polypeptides/proteins targeting individual or multiple defined molecular products, such as enzymes, circulating proteins, cell-surface receptors and cellular RNAs (Moller, 2012) . Applications of metabolic modulation have great potential for disease modeling and therapies. However, developing novel approaches with more specific and more flexible modulation of metabolic genes in vivo is still challenging, because natural and synthesized modulators with high targeting specificity are theoretically limited.
In recent years, an increasing number of genetic modification tools has emerged. Representing one of the greatest breakthroughs, the CRISPR/Cas author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

However, permanent modification of DNA is usually not an optimal strategy for the therapies of acquired metabolic disorders.
Recent breakthroughs with RNA-guided RNA-targeting systems, such as class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effectors, were reported for the remarkable capability of RNA editing without permanent modification of DNA. Theoretically, RNA-targeting systems could provide a much safer approach for gene silencing (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2017; Konermann et al., 2018; Pineda et al., 2019) . Among such systems, CasRx was recently found to be advantageous, mostly because it is more efficient and has more robust activation during RNA-guided RNA cleavage in mammalian cells in vitro (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) . CasRx is a type VI-D effector (Cas13d) with a small size that can be packaged into AAVs, and thus has great potential for translational medicine (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) . In this study, we set out to explore the feasibility of using the CasRx system for the targeted silencing of metabolic genes.

CasRx and each Pten sgRNA were introduced through plasmids transfection into mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (Fig. S2A ). After 48 hours, the N2a cells with the transfected CasRx and each Pten sgRNA were analyzed to evaluate their levels of Pten mRNA. As expected, all of our designed Pten sgRNAs revealed successful down-regulation of the level of Pten mRNA (Fig. S2A ).
Next, improvement of knockdown efficiency was tested on the strategy to combine the different Pten sgRNA individuals (Fig. S2B , C, D). After sgPten-5 and sgPten-6 were combined in treatment, the reduction of Pten mRNA levels successfully reached 16±3%, the most efficient of all combinations (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S2D ). Previously, Pten was known as a metabolic regulator that suppressed the insulin signaling by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway (Cho et al., 2001; Stiles et al., 2004) . Deletion of Pten promoted AKT phosphorylation (Stiles et al., 2004) . Accordingly, such effects were also shown in our results after the successful knockdown of Pten through the combination of sgPten-5 and sgPten-6. In the N2a cells that were transfected with CasRx, sgPten-5 and sgPten-6, the PTEN protein levels were significanty decreased while the AKT phosphorylation levels were significantly elevated (Fig. 1C ). author/funder.

The CasRx system has, however, been reported to be with significantly reduced off-target events compared to other RNAi approaches (Konermann et al., 2018) . Here, we set out to compare the CasRx system with spacer sequence-match shRNAs in knockdown of Pten via transient transfection in N2a cells. Consistent with previous studies, Pten-targeting shRNAs rendered wide-spread off-target transcript changes (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, transfection of the spacer-matched CasRx system induced significantly reduced transcript changes (Fig. 1D) . Importantly, Pten was the most significantly changed gene (Fig. 1D ). These results further validated the high specificity of CasRx-mediated transcript interference.
Next, CasRx-mediated knockdown of a targeted gene was broadly studied among metabolism regulatory genes. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a crucial protein of serum LDL cholesterol regulation (Lambert et al., 2012) . Here, a total of 11 candidate sgRNAs were designed and tested, with the goal of targeting the coding region of Pcsk9 (Fig. S1B ). As expected, all Pcsk9 sgRNA candidates showed the effects of robust knockdown of Pcsk9 mRNAs in the 293T cells transfected with each sgRNA for Pcsk9 (Fig. S2E) . Moreover, CasRx-mediated targeted knockdown could also be applied for lncLstr, a liver-enriched lncRNA ( Fig. S1C and S2F ). author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

After the successful establishment of a method for CasRx-mediated gene knockdown in the cultured mammalian cells in vitro, the feasibility of in vivo metabolic gene targeting was studied. The three metabolic genes Pten, Pcsk9
and lncLstr, were further studied to determine whether gene knockdown was effective in hepatocytes. At first, the effect of CasRx-mediated Pten gene knockdown in the liver was studied through the evaluation of Pten mRNA levels. CasRx, sgPten-5, and sgPten-6 were delivered to the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of indicated plasmids (Fig. S3A ).
Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection, a simple yet effective method, can be used to deliver naked DNA into hepatocytes of mouse liver in vivo (Kim and Ahituv, 2013) . After 96 hours of plasmid injection, individual hepatocytes were dissociated through liver perfusion. Hepatocytes expressing both GFP and mCherry implied successful vector delivery and were purified through cell sorting. Though not mathematically significant, results suggested that the Pten mRNA level in GFP+/mCherry+ hepatocytes had decreased in comparison with that in GFP-/mCherry-hepatocytes (Fig. S3B) .

Next, the feasibility of the CasRx system in knockdown of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in vivo was investigated. LncLstr is a liver-enriched lncRNA, which regulates lipid metabolism by inhibition of Cyp8b1 (Li et al., 2015) . Similar with the above methods for in vivo vector deliveries, hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding CasRx and those encoding both sglncLstr-5 and sglncLstr-6 were performed (Fig. S3A ). Hepatocytes that received these two plasmids showed significant reduction of lncLstr (Fig. S3E ).
CasRx-mediated lncLstr knockdown was sufficient to result in reduced expression of Cyp8b1 (Fig. S3F ). Thus, efficient knockdown of lncRNA was successfully obtained in hepatocytes using the CasRx system.
In an effort to explore the feasibility of using the CasRx system in simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes, we cloned a vector encoding CasRx and GFP together with 6 sgRNAs targeting Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr ( Fig. S3G) . Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of this plasmid into the liver simultaneously decreased all three targeted genes, providing a powerful platform for simultaneous knockdown of multiple metabolic genes (Fig. S3G) .

Four days after injection of GFP-expressing CasRx plasmids, we observed scattered hepatocytes with reduced PTEN staining (Fig. 1F) . Importantly, GFP+ hepatocytes were also negative or low for PTEN staining (Fig. 1F) . We also observed increased AKT phosphorylation in hepatocytes receiving the CasRx plasmids, suggesting a functional knockdown of Pten in these cells (Fig.   1F ). To further characterize the hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids, we isolated GFP+ hepatocytes by FACS sorting. The GFP+ hepatocytes showed significantly reduced expression of Pten and increased AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1G, H) .
To explore the functional activation of AKT signaling cascades, we investigated the response of lipid and glucose metabolism-related genes downstream of AKT. The results showed that Pten knockdown significantly increased the expressions of Fasn (fatty acid synthase) and Srebp1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1) in the GFP+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1I) , which was consistent with previous findings (Stiles et al., 2004) . Pten-inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling was found to be critical for lipogenesis regulation in the liver, while the activated AKT repressed SREBP1, a key transcription factor required for the expression of Fasn (Haeusler et al., 2014; He et al., 2010) .
Therefore, decrease of PTEN promoted the expression of Fasn and Srebp1 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Next, AAV8, an efficient liver-targeted gene delivery system, was applied to further increase the effect of in vivo Pcsk9 knockdown ( Fig. 2A ) (Shen et al., 2007) . PCSK9 is secreted by hepatocytes, and has great promise as a candidate of drug targets among all regulators of serum cholesterol (Steinberg and Witztum, 2009) . Accumulating evidence shows that inhibition of PCSK9 lowered serum cholesterol levels (Chan et al., 2009; Rossidis et al., 2018 ).
Increased plasma LDL cholesterol level is one of the major causes for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as many other diseases (LaRosa et al., 1990; Law et al., 1994) . Thus, we chose the CasRx system applied to Pcsk9 gene knockdown in hepatocytes for the purpose of reducing serum cholesterol levels.
We delivered CasRx, sgPcsk9-5 and sgPcsk9-6 to the liver by AAV8, which significantly reduced Pcsk9 mRNA level ( Fig. 2A, B) . The serum PCSK9 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Serum total cholesterol levels were reduced to 61.6±19.4% of normal levels (p=0.002) (Fig.   2D ). Moreover, the liver function of AAV-injected mice, saline-injected and non-injected mice were similar, and we did not observe obvious liver injuries in these mice (Fig. 2E, F) . Thus, the CasRx system provides an efficient tool targeting Pcsk9 to reduce serum cholesterol in vivo.
To investigate whether CasRx-mediated gene knockdown is reversible after removal of the CasRx system, we delivered CasRx plasmids expressing GFP, Cre and Pcsk9-targeting sgRNAs to the livers of ROSA-CAG-lsl-tdTomato mice by hydrodynamic injection (Fig. 2G) . CasRx plasmids expressing LacZ-targeting sgRNA were used as controls.
Hepatocytes receiving the plasmids could be traced by the expression of red fluorescent protein tdTomato. One day after injection of plasmids, Pcsk9 mRNA levels in hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids (tdTomato+) decreased to 16.5±4.9% of those in hepatocytes without plasmids (GFP-/tdTomato-) (Fig. 2H) . Along with the gradual loss of CasRx plasmids in hepatocytes, the Pcsk9 mRNA levels gradually recovered to normal levels 15 days after injection ( Fig. 2H and Fig. S4A ). Importantly, a second-round injection of the plasmids achieved a similar efficiency of Pcsk9 knockdown compared to that in the first-round of plasmids injection (Fig. 2H) . These author/funder.

Through these early studies we have successfully obtained firsthand information and experiences for realizing the potential and feasibility of the other approaches of gene knockdown with RNA interference, the CasRx system-derived approach was more specific and efficient (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) . In this study, we demonstrated that the CasRx system could efficiently target RNA for knockdown in hepatocytes, providing a robust method to inactivate genes in polyploid cells in vivo.
Another advantage of CasRx is its small size, when considering therapeutic potential (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Konermann et al., 2018) .
