Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease 34 caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high 35 mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we 36 developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together 37 with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-38 like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to 39 enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of 40 IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid 41 without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against 42 surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, 43 as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in 44 protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein 45 immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens 46 induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in 47 relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, 48 both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to 49 induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, 50 optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and 51 incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine 52 development.
53 54 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infection 58 endemic to East Asia including China, Korea, and Japan. Gradual rise of disease incidence 59 and relatively high mortality have become a serious public health problem in the endemic 60 countries. In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA encoding four antigens, 61 Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, of SFTS virus (SFTSV) as a vaccine candidate. In order to enhance cell-62 mediated immunity, the viral antigens were fused with Flt3L and IL-2 gene was incorporated 63 into the plasmid. Immunization with the DNA vaccine provides complete protection against 64 lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses might play a 65 major role in the protection since we observed enhanced T cell responses specific to the viral 66 antigens but failed to detect neutralizing antibody in the immunized mice. When we 67 immunized with either viral glycoprotein, Gn protein induced relatively higher neutralizing 68 activity and better protection against SFTSV infection than Gc antigen, but neither generated 69 complete protection. Therefore, an optimal combination of DNA and protein elements, as 70 well as proper selection of target antigens, might be required to produce an effective SFTSV 71 vaccine. 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 .

leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia [3, 4] . Disease mortality of SFTS patients has been 88 estimated to be 5 ~ 20% [3] . Even though the majority of SFTS cases has been reported from 89 China [3] , Korea [4] , and Japan [5] , SFTSV infections in southern Asia, including Vietnam, 90 have been recently reported in a retrospective survey [6] . Currently, no specific viral therapy 91 nor vaccine is available. An effective vaccine is needed to combat its relatively high mortality, 92 especially in elderly patients, and spread of SFTSV between humans [7, 8] . 93 Vaccine development for SFTS is at an early discovery phase and there have only been a few 94 studies on vaccine candidates using animal infection models [8] [9] [10] [11] . Immunization of NS 95 antigen with Freund's adjuvant in C57BL/6 mice, which are naturally resistant to SFTSV but 96 partially mimic human infections [12] , failed to enhance viral clearance, although it induced The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/787879 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 103 attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the SFTSV 104 Gn/Gc glycoproteins elicited high titers of protective neutralizing antibodies in both wild type 105 and interferon α/β receptor knockout (IFNAR KO) mice [11] . They clearly showed that a 106 single dose rVSV carrying SFTSV Gn/Gc could provide complete protection against lethal 107 challenge with SFTSV in young and old IFNAR KO mice, a promising infection model for 108 severe human infection of SFTSV [11, 13, 14] . Nevertheless, the potential role of cellular 109 immunity against the viral antigens in complete protection was not examined in this study, 110 although adoptive transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with rVSV-Gn/Gc to naïve 111 IFNAR KO mice provide partial (~ 60%) protection against lethal SFTSV challenge [11] . 112 In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA (pSFTSV) encoding extracellular 113 domains of Gn and Gc, and NP-NS fusion antigen as a DNA vaccine candidate. We 114 examined whether it could provide protective immunity against lethal SFTSV infection in 115 IFNAR KO mice. In order to facilitate the processing and presentation of the SFTSV antigens 116 by dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses, these recombinant 117 antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) [15, 16] . Moreover, we 118 generated a recombinant DNA encoding IL-12 and  in addition to the recombinant viral 119 antigens (pSFTSV-IL12) to further enhance cell-mediated immunity [17] . Vaccination of 120 pSFTSV-IL12 provided complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV 121 challenge, whereas immunization with pSFTSV elicits only partial protection, indicating that 122 antigen-specific cellular immune responses enhanced by co-expression of IL-12 could play a 123 significant role in protection against lethal SFTSV infection. We confirmed significantly 124 higher levels of Gn and NP-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in mice vaccinated with 125 pSFTSV-IL12 when compared to those in mock vector-immunized mice. Therefore, our 126 results indicate that enhanced antigen-specific T cell immunity against multiple SFTVS In order to generate plasmids for DNA vaccination, genes encoding ectodomains of Gn, Gc 141 (from Genebank accession no. AJO16082.1), and NP/NS fusion protein (from Genebank 142 accession no. AJO16088.1 and AKI34298.1, respectively) were synthesized (GenScript, 143 Piscataway, NJ, USA) and cloned into pGX27 vector (Genexine, Seongnam, Republic of 144 Korea). All these genes were fused with signal peptide of tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA, 145 Uniport no. P00750) and Flt3L (Uniport no. P49771) in their N-terminus [15] (pSFTSV, Fig   146   1 ). In addition, murine IL-12α and β genes (Uniport no. P43432) [17] were also synthesized 147 (GenScript) and cloned into pSFTSV (pSFTSV-IL-12, Fig 1) .
To confirm the expression of cloned genes in pSFTSV and pSFTSV-IL12, HEK 293T cells Overexpressed recombinant proteins in supernatants were purified by AKTA start affinity confirmed by ELISA and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2) . All the viral antigens were detected 312 in cell culture supernatants, as well as in cellular lysates (Fig. 2B) . KO mice to a Korean SFTSV isolate was examined by inoculating the mice with 1 x 10 1 to 1 375 x 10 5 FFU (S3 Fig A) . Upon infection, all the mice gradually lost body weight and became 376 moribund from the third to fifth day after infection, depending on the infection dose. All the 377 infected mice died at 5 ~ 9 d after infection (S3 Fig A) . Similar survival kinetics were 378 previously reported in IFNAR KO mice infected with other SFTSV strains [11, 14] , 379 indicating that our Korean SFTSV isolate possesses an equivalent degree of virulence to prior 380 Chinese isolates. The platelet counts in mice infected with 1 x 10 5 FFU of SFTSV 381 significantly declined up to 4 d after infection, and the mean platelet volumes of the infected 382 mice were significantly higher than those of control animals (S3 Fig B) , suggesting that 383 platelet destruction and the activation of platelet production simultaneously occur during 384 lethal infection [14] .
To assess the protective efficacy of the DNA vaccine, groups of mice were immunized with . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

All the mock-immunized mice 388 expired by 5 d after SFTSV infection. In contrast, all the mice immunized with pSFTSV-IL12 389 were protected from lethal viral challenge, and 40% (2 of 5) of mice vaccinated with pSFTSV 390 survived (Fig. 4A) . Consistently, pSFTSV-IL12-vaccinated animals lost weight until 4 d after vaccinated mice (mean ± S.D. = 4.2 × 10 6 ± 4.6 × 10 6 ) were approximately five and fifty 402 times lower than those of pSFTSV-vaccinated mice (mean ± S.D. = 2.1 × 10 7 ± 1.7 × 10 7 ) 403 and vector-immunized mice (mean ± S.D. = 2.0 × 10 8 ± 1.9 × 10 8 ) at 4 d, respectively. Given that immunization with Gn-Fc and Gc-Fc proteins can induce specific antibodies in 478 IFNAR KO mice (Fig. 5) Flt3L can significantly enhance CD8 T cell responses when fused with a target antigen and 484 promote persistent maintenance of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo [16, 29] . In this study, 485 we also observed significant enhancement of Gn and NP-specific CD8 T cell responses, as 486 well as CD4 T cells, in the presence of IL-12 expression ( Fig. 3B and C) , which correlated
