Our ability to estimate the basic reproduction number of emerging infectious diseases is often 29 hindered by the paucity of information about the epidemiological characteristics and transmission 30 mechanisms of new pathogens (1) . Alternative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the 31 extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they 32 rely on minimal and routinely collected data that capture the trajectory of an outbreak (2) . 33
Epidemic doubling times characterize the sequence of intervals at which the cumulative incidence 34 doubles (3). If an epidemic is growing exponentially with a constant growth rate r, the doubling time 35 remains constant and equals to (ln 2)/r. An increase in the doubling time indicates a slowdown in 36 transmission if the underlying reporting rate remains unchanged (Technical Appendix) (4). 37
Here we analyzed by province the number of times COVID-19 cumulative incidence doubled and 38 the evolution of the doubling times in mainland China (5) , from January 20 (when nationwide reporting 39 began) through February 9, 2020. Province-level daily cumulative incidence data were retrieved from 40 provincial health commissions' websites. Two sensitivity analyses based on a longer and a shorter time 41 period respectively were conducted (Technical Appendix). Tibet was excluded from further analysis 42 because there had only been one case reported during the study period. 43
From January 20 through February 9, the harmonic mean of the arithmetic means of the doubling 44 times estimated from cumulative incidence ranged from 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2, 2.0) days (Hunan) to 3.1 (95% 45 CI, 2.1, 4.8) days (Xinjiang). In Hubei, it was estimated as 2.5 (95% CI, 2.4, 2.6) days. The cumulative 46 incidence doubled 6 times in Hubei. The harmonic mean of the arithmetic means of doubling times in all 47 of mainland China except Hubei was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5, 2.3) days. Provinces with a harmonic mean of the 48 arithmetic means of doubling times <2d included Fujian, Guangxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, 49
Jiangxi, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang (Figures 1 and S1 ). 50 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 6, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020750 doi: medRxiv preprint As the epidemic progressed, it took longer for the cumulative incidence in mainland China 51 (except Hubei) to double itself, which indicated an overall sub-exponential growth pattern outside Hubei 52 ( Figures S1, S2 ). In Hubei, the doubling time decreased and then increased. A gradual increase in the 53 doubling time coincided with the social distancing measures and intra-and-inter-provincial travel 54 restrictions imposed across China since the implementation of quarantine of Wuhan on January 23 (6) . 55
Our estimates of doubling times are shorter than prior estimates of 7.4 days (95% CI, 4.2-14) (5), 56 6 .4 days (95% CrI, 5.8-7.1) (7), and 7.1 days (95% CI, 3.0-20.5) (8) respectively. Li et al. using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and fitted an exponential growth model to provide the epidemic 60 growth rate (8) . Our estimates are based on cumulative confirmed case count by reporting date by 61 province from January 20 through February 9. 62 Our study is subject to limitations, including underreporting of cases (9) . One reason for 63 underreporting is underdiagnosis, due to lack of diagnostic tests, healthcare workers, and other resources. 64
Further, underreporting is likely heterogeneous across provinces. As long as reporting remains invariant 65 over time within the same province, the calculation of doubling times remains reliable; however, this is a 66 strong assumption. Growing awareness of the epidemic and increasing availability of diagnostic tests 67 might have strengthened reporting over time, which could have artificially shortened the doubling time. 68
Nevertheless, apart from Hubei and Guangdong (first case reported on January 19), nationwide reporting 69 only began on January 20, and at this point, Chinese authorities had openly acknowledged the magnitude 70 and severity of the epidemic. Due to a lack of detailed case data describing incidence trends for imported 71 and local cases, we focused our analysis on the overall trajectory of the epidemic without adjusting for the 72 role of imported cases on the local transmission dynamics. Indeed, it is likely that the proportion of 73 imported cases was significant for provinces that only reported a few cases; their short doubling times in 74 the study period could simply reflect rapid detection of imported cases. However, with the data until 75 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

It would be interesting to  76   investigate the evolution of the doubling time after accounting for case importations if more detailed data  77   becomes available.  78 To conclude, we observed an increasing trend in the epidemic doubling time of COVID-19 by 79

Motivation. R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is hindered by the paucity of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission mechanisms. More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal data on the outbreak's trajectory (2) . Data sources. Daily cumulative incidence data were retrieved from provincial health commissions' websites (Table S8 ). Data were double-checked against the cumulative national total published by the National Health Commission (3), data compiled by the Centre for Health Protection, Hong Kong, when .

Whenever discrepancies arose, provincial government sources were deemed authoritative.
As the epidemic grows, the times at which cumulative incidence doubles are given by such that where , , and i = 0,1,2,3, …, nd where is the total number of times cumulative incidence doubles. The actual sequence of "doubling times" are defined as follows:
where j = 1,2,3, …, nd.
To quantify parameter uncertainty, we used parametric bootstrapping with a Poisson error structure around the harmonic mean of doubling times to obtain the 95% confidence interval. See references (6-8) for further details.
If we assume homogeneous mixing (equal probability of acquiring infection through contacts) and exponential growth, then, C(t2) = C(t1)exp(rt), and therefore, ln(C(t2)/C(t1)) = rt. When C(t2)/C(t1) = 2 and thus t is the doubling time, i.e. t = td, ln2 = rtd. Therefore, the doubling time, td, equals to (ln2)/r. See
Vynnycky and White (9), panel 4.1, p.74 for further explanation.
Additional details on methods. Doubling time calculation was conducted using MATLAB R2019b
(Mathworks, Natick, MA). Figures were created either using R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team) or MATLAB 2019b. Significance level in this manuscript was a priori decided to be α = 0.05.
Cumulative incidence over time. From Figure S7 to Figure S10 , we provided plots of cumulative incidence over time (left panel) and semi-log plots with log10-transformed cumulative incidence over time .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 6, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020750 doi: medRxiv preprint (right panel) for a total of 8 provinces with a relatively high number of cases, namely, the epicenter Hubei, followed by (in alphabetical order) Fujian, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Shandong. If the epidemic is growing exponentially, the log10-transformed cumulative incidence over time will be a linear curve. If social distancing would have an impact, the slope of the semi-log plot would decrease, indicating a decreasing epidemic growth rate.
Harmonic mean of the harmonic mean. In this study, we also presented the harmonic mean of the harmonic means of the estimates of the epidemic doubling times. The harmonic means of the epidemic doubling times are shorter than their arithmetic means. From January 20 through February 9, the harmonic mean of the harmonic means of the doubling times estimated ranged from 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2, Further discussion. The slowing-down of the epidemic as represented in increasing epidemic doubling times in our study is also consistent with a study by Benjamin F. Maier and Dirk Brockmann, "Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China" (pre-print available at arXiv. 2020:2002.07572). They also identified sub-exponential growth of the outbreak across provinces, as mass quarantine and restriction of travels across mainland China began since January 23, 2020.
Sensitivity analysis #1. We performed a sensitivity analysis by expanding our data analysis to the data since December 31, 2019, when Hubei first reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unexplained etiology that turned out to be COVID-19. The only difference between the sensitivity analysis and the main analysis is the inclusion of Hubei and Guangdong data from December 31, 2019, through January 19, 2020, because nationwide reporting started on January 20, 2020. The only differences in results were found for Hubei and Guangdong. For Hubei, the harmonic mean of the arithmetic mean of the doubling .

The first doubling time of Hubei ( Figure S3 ) was high, reflecting that real-time data was unavailable before mid-January. It was only by January 17, 2020, onwards when data reporting become increasingly transparent and timely.
Sensitivity analysis #2. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by restricting our data analysis to the data from January 23, 2020 through February 9, 2020, to allow for the time that all the other provinces to ramp up their testing. January 23 was also the day when the Chinese authorities to put the city of Wuhan on 'lockdown' and major inter-provincial travel restrictions were put in place. When we changed the start date of our study period from January 20 (main analysis) to January 23, 2020 (sensitivity analysis #2), the epidemic doubling time of the aggregate cumulative incidence of mainland China (except Hubei) Figure S5 , S6). Apart from the epidemic doubling time of the aggregate cumulative incidence of mainland China (except Hubei), we did not observe significant differences by province between results in the main analysis and sensitivity analysis #2. Therefore, our results should be robust for the purpose of this study.
