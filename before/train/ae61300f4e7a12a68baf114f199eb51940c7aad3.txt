To predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model.
We forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures.
The peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as
should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb. 19,2020(in Hubei) .It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese
epidemic can be completetly controlled in May,2020.
COVID-19 is only a local outbreak in Hubei Province,China.It can be probably avoided the pandemic of global
cases rise with the great efforts by Chinese government and its people.

Many academics tried to estimate key epidemiological characteristics and possible outcomes of the epidemic by means of transmission model mathematically.On Jan.24,2020,Jonathan M. Read 3 estimated the basic reproduction index(R0) for SARS-CoV-2 to be between 3.6 and 4.0,then and COVID-19 would outbreak further both in other Chinese cities and in international travel destinations sucn as Thailand,Japan,Taiwan,Hong Kong and South Korea at an sharply increasing rate.According to his model,he predicted the number of infected individuals in Wuhan to be greater than 190 thousand by Feb. 14,2020 although with a 99% effective reduction as a result of trave restrictions,the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan might only be reduced by 24.9%.His model suggested that travel limitation from and to Wuhan city were unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China.
Professor Joseph T Wu 4 published a paper in the Lancet on Jan. 31,2020.The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 2.68 by MCMC method,and the SEIR model was used to predict the epidemic.
However,there were some deficiencies in his study:1)the main population outflow from Wuhan was not outside of Hubei Province:his study focused on several large cities (Chongqing,Beijing,Shanghai,Guangzhou and Shenzhen),instead of the moderate-sized urban All rights reserved.

According to the epidemic data before Feb.1,2020,it indicated that the probability from the exposed to the infected was 1.7%, 13,14 and the average incubation period was 7 days,and the average hospital stay was 14 days. 15, 16 The average daily contact rate of the infected was 6,referring to the statistical data from CCDC in the early stage of SARS epidemic in 2003. 17,18, 19 However,the population density in Hubei Province was 2.3 times the national average, so the daily contact rate in Hubei was 13.8,and the average daily contact rate of the latent was twice as the infected.The calculation method was R0 = average daily contact rate× probability of the exposed to the infected ×infection period. The average infection period was 21 days. Therefore, R0 was 4.9-9.9 in Hubei,but 2. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
