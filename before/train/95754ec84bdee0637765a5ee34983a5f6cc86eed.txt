B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has a dual function, acting both as an oncogene 20 and an anti-tumor gene. It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting 21 function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which 22 Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown 23 that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G 0 /G 1 to the S phase after serum 24 starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower 25 level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on 26 the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome 27 proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), a key molecule induced by 28 .

Here, we showed that 30 PGC-1α was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following 31 Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2 32 expression.

Introduction 39 B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic potentials. It 40 is well known that Bcl-2 protein is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane, 41 and antagonizes with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX by forming Bcl-2/BAX 42 heterodimers that control mitochondrial membrane permeability and promote formation are not fully understood. 52 We have recently observed that quiescent Bcl-2 overexpressing cells maintain The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Our cell cycle profiles showed that both 3T3PB and 3T3Bcl-2 were 87 arrested successfully in G 0 /G 1 phase, the proportion of cells in S phase dropped from 88 ~20% (normal growing, NG) to less than 3% (serum starved, SS) for both cells (Fig. 89 1A and 1B). We also observed a significant elevation in p27 levels in SS3T3Bcl-2 90 cells, confirming that Bcl-2 function as tumor-repressive gene through upregulating 91 p27 ( Fig. 1C and 1D ). At this stage, PGC-1α expression was clearly increased in 92 SS3T3Bcl-2 comparing with NG3T3Bcl-2 cells, while there was no significant 93 difference between control cells SS3T3PB and NG3T3PB ( Fig. 1C and 1E ). This 94 result suggests that PGC-1α expression associates with Bcl-2 after serum depletion. Fig. 1 and 2) , suggesting a relationship between PGC-1α and Bcl-2. We hypothesized 187 that Bcl-2 may recruit and rely on PGC-1α to reduce ROS, which mediated cell cycle 188 as a critical signal. To test this possibility, Bcl-2 knockdown by siRNA was performed, 189 and as we expected, PGC-1α expression was correspondingly decreased (Fig.3) . 190 Together with the facts that PGC-1α regulates mitochondrial function to eliminate 191 ROS, and arrested Bcl-2 cells contain less ROS, these results suggest that Bcl-2 might 192 recruit PGC-1α to reduce ROS levels and block cell cycle progression. 193 To further clarify the relationship between Bcl-2 and PGC-1α, we investigated the 194 influence of PGC-1α knockdown on Bcl-2 expression. Endogenous expression of 195 PGC-1α is low in normal growing 3T3Bcl-2 and control cells (Fig. 1C, Fig. 2C The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
