Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict 36 the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. 37
Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was 38 collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on 39 the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups 40 were analyzed. 41
Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two 42 groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, 43 respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK 44 cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild 45 group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than 46 severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and 47 cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, 48 IL-6 and IL-10. 49
Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels 50
were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for 51 predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm 52 the "warning value" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10. 53

The detection reagent of cytokine was provided by Qingdao Raisecare Biotechnology Co., Ltd 87 (calibrator lot number: 20190801). Six cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF and IFN  88 were detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer's 89 instructions. After the blood sample and the corresponding flow tube be numbered 101, 102, 103, 90 104, and 105, EDTA-K2 anticoagulant whole blood was centrifuged at 2365 r / min for 30 min. 91
Then 25 μL of experimental buffer, 25 μL of centrifuged plasma, 25 μL of capture microsphere 92 antibody, and 25 μL of detection antibody were added to the corresponding flow tube. After 93 incubating at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark with gentle shaking, 25 μL SA-PE was added 94 into the flow tube respectively, and then incubation was continued for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 95 the diluted wash buffer (1:10) was added to the flow tube. After a few seconds of vortex shaking, 96 the flow tube was centrifuged at 1500r / min for 5 minutes, the liquid was slowly poured out, and 97 the flow tube was inverted on the absorbent paper. Then 100 μL of diluted washing buffer (1:10) 98 was added to the flow tube according to the requirements of the flow cytometer, and the test was 99 performed after shaking for 10 seconds. 100
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 102
Descriptive analyses were performed for categorical variables such as gender. Continuous variables 103 such as inspection results were expressed as x ± s and compared using the independent samples t-104
test. Correlation analysis results were expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and a larger r 2 105 indicates better linear correlation. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. 106
This study was approved by the ethical committee of Chongqing Three Gorges Central 108

According to the results of each index, CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + 117 T were divided into below normal value, within normal value and above normal value. The 118 corresponding quantities and proportions were respectively calculated, and the results were shown 119
in Table 1 In severe patients, CD4 + T was lower than normal in 20 patients (95.24%), within normal in 128 1 patient (4.76%); CD8 + T was lower than normal in 13 patients (61.90%), within normal in 8 129 patients (38.10%); B cell was lower than normal in 6 patients (28.57%), within normal in 15 patients 130 (71.43%); NK cell was lower than normal in 10 patients (47.62%), and within normal in 11 patients 131 (52.10%) 38%, 18 (85.71%) patients had CD4 + / CD8 + ratio within the normal value, 2 (9.53%) 132 patients were lower than the normal value, 1 (4.76%) was higher than the normal value. 133
IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF, and IFN were divided into values of 0, within the normal value 135
(normal values other than 0), and above the normal value according to the results of various 136
indicators. The corresponding quantities and proportions were counted ( is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Considering that the value of IL-6 changed most in the mild and severe groups, the correlation 148 between the lymphocyte subsets and the cytokine IL-6 was analyzed. The data with IL-6 value of 0 149 in each group (57 cases in light group and 3 cases in severe group) were excluded, and 45 cases in 150 the mild group and 18 cases in severe group were included in the correlation analysis. As shown in 151 Table 3 , the correlation analysis between IL-6 and lymphocyte subsets showed that the Pearson 152 correlation coefficients of IL-6 and CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + T were 153 very low, and there was no significant linear correlation. 154
and severe NCP 156
The data (57 cases of IL-6 and 3 cases of IFN in the mild group) with the index value of 0 in 157 the two groups were excluded. Two independent-samples t test was performed on the lymphocyte 158 subsets and cytokines of the mild group and the severe group, with α= 0.05 as the inspection level. 159
Significant differences were observed in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 between the mild group 160 and the severe group (P < 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in B cell, NK cell, 161
CD4 + T / CD8 + T, IL-4, IL-17, TNF, IFN between the two groups (P > 0.05, Table 4 ). 162
Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each 164 cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate 165 of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction 166 rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating 167 that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV 168
infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen 2 in SARS coronavirus, 169 revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus 170 infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe 171 group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for 172 34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV 173 infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune 174 adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new 175 .

The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between 193 lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and 194 cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, 195 CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting 196 that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which 197 was consistent with the opinions of many experts. 5, 6 For several results of this study, for example, 198 the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there 199 was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for 207 patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample 208
size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some 209 impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the 210 middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively 211 reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there 212 was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale 213 outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank 214
In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further 216 explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with 217
2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to 218 carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the 219 sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen 220 the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient's peripheral 221 blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines.
