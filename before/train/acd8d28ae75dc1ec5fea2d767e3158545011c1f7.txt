Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, 49 characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and 50 appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1β, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1β and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of 65 mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit 66 increment in IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 67 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year had significantly 68 decreased by an average of 18.45 compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's 69 duration of ≥ 5years (reference group).

Levels of IL-35 72 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year had significantly 73 decreased (p-value = 0.002) on average by 41.82 compared to patients with a duration of 74 mycetoma infection ≥ five years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that 75 both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 in 76 eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative 77 impact on disease progression. 78 79 Authors Summary 80 Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may 81 result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is 82 a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the 83 disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse 84 medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community.
85 Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to 86 causative agents and the disease progression. The recently identified IL -35 and IL-37 87 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the 88 expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been 89 investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of 90 IL-1 family (IL-1β, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the 91 association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic 92 characteristics. .

The results of this study showed that the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently 94 positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. 95 However, the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with 96 different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of 97 the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a 98 significant negative association with IL-1β cytokine. Furthermore, the risk factors of 99 higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a significant negative 100 association with IL-12. These findings uncover a possible the role of IL-35 and IL-37 in 101
Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous subcutaneous inflammatory disease, caused by 108 certain bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). This infection progresses to affect pre-existing Th2 environment caused by schistosomiasis promotes the development of 140 mycetoma as patients with mycetoma were significantly more positive for schistosoma 141 antibodies than healthy endemic controls [9] . These findings suggested that Th2 like 142 response and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines could have a negative impact 143 on mycetoma development and disease progression. 144 IL-1 is a polypeptide which has two forms; IL-1α and IL-1β. It is involved in the acute-phase 145 response and is accountable for several alterations that are related to the onset of various 146 medical disorders [15, 16] . It is demonstrated recently that higher levels of IL-1β cytokine 147 are strongly associated with surgically treated mycetoma patients, in comparison to those 148 treated without surgery [17] . It is known that IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is 149 involved in cell death coordination [18] . IL-1β cytokine is cleaved into the mature, active and disease severity in murine aspergillosis [29] . In addition to its role in innate immunity; IL-174 37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing regulatory T (T reg ) cells 175 and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses [30] . To our knowledge, there has been 176 no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis so far. poorly understood. However IL-35 is recognised as a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine, and 189 the predominant mechanism of suppression is associated with its ability to suppress T cell (Table 2) . On the other hand, the 287 levels of cytokine IL-1β were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-37 and IL-35, ( Table   288 2). Furthermore, the levels of cytokine IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-289 35 (Table 2) . However, the levels of cytokine IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively 290 correlated with IL-12 (Table 2) . (Table 3) . Whereas, levels of IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-35 (Table   .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/502609 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3). However, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-300 12, (Table 3) . Table  (Table 8) . Furthermore, the circulating levels of IL-37 had significantly decreased with 369 increasing age groups [(19-24 years; p-value = 0.0100), 25-29 years; p-value =0.030 and 370 (30-39) years; p-value = 0.022)] (Table 8) . Interestingly, levels of IL-37 among mycetoma 371 patients showed a statistically significant difference between Itraconazole compared to 372 Ketoconazole, p < 0.001, (Table 8) . (Table 9 ). Additionally, the circulating levels of IL-35 showed no 384 significant association with the different age groups (Table 9) . Interestingly, treatment with 385 Itraconazole significantly increased circulating levels of IL-35 among mycetoma patients 386 compared to treatment with Ketoconazole, p-value <0.001, (Table 9) .

More investigations are needed 506 to explore the mechanism by which IL-35 and IL-37 contribute in the mycetoma infection 507 outcomes. This will help in understanding the role of these cytokines IL-35 and IL-37 in the 508 pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may exploit it as a potential therapeutic target to prevent 509 mycetoma diseases recurrence. .
