Bats are reservoirs for a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFNα in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.
Bats are recognized as important viral reservoirs due to their ability to harbor a number of highly pathogenic viruses, including Nipah virus (NiV) (1), Hendra virus (HeV) (2) , Marburg virus (3), SARS coronavirus (4) , and Ebolavirus (5) without suffering from overt disease symptoms (6) (7) (8) (9) . A recent study identified bats as hosts for a greater proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders tested, with the highest viral richness found in Flavi-, Bunya-and Rhabdoviruses (10) . While the mechanisms underlying disease resistance are not known, it has been speculated that bats possess unique immune components that confer innate antiviral protection (9, 11) . In vertebrates, one of the first lines of defense against viral pathogens is the interferon (IFN) response. Upon viral infection, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense viral components and initiate a signaling cascade that results in the secretion of IFNs. These IFNs bind their cognate receptors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcriptional induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have antiviral activity (12) .
Pteropus alecto (also known as the black flying fox or black fruit bat) is an asymptomatic natural reservoir for the highly lethal henipaviruses (13, 14) . Studies of the recently sequenced P. alecto genome revealed that genes for key components of antiviral immunity are conserved in bats, such as pathogen sensors (including toll-like receptors (15) , RIG-I-like helicases, and NOD-like receptors), IFNs and their receptors, and ISGs (11, 16) . Previous efforts to study batvirus interactions have mainly focused on the host response to viral infection (17) (18) (19) (20) , but global transcriptional responses to type I IFN remain uncharacterized.
Since P. alecto harbors pathogenic human viruses and has an annotated genome, we sought to characterize the IFN-induced transcriptional response in this species. Gene expression analyses revealed that bat cells induce a pool of common ISGs. However, they also induced a small number of apparent novel ISGs, including 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease (RNASEL) . Kinetic analyses revealed that bat ISGs can be categorized into distinct groups .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint depending on their temporal gene expression patterns. Additionally, maintenance of ISG expression over time differed between bat and human cells, suggesting distinct mechanisms of gene regulation.
Previous studies have shown that exogenous IFNα and IFNγ treatment of cells from P. alecto can suppress Pteropine orthoreovirus Pulau virus (21) and Hendra virus (22) , respectively. We treated immortalized P. alecto kidney-derived (PaKi) cells for 24h with universal IFNα, which is designed for activity across multiple species. We then infected the cells with two model GFPexpressing reporter viruses: a negative-sense single-stranded RNA rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and a positive-sense single stranded RNA flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV). We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of both viruses with IFN treatment (Fig 1A, B) .
VSV infection was maximally inhibited by only 50%, whereas YFV infection was suppressed completely at the highest IFN dose. In addition, we confirmed IFN-mediated dose-dependent and time-dependent induction of the canonical ISG MX1 (Fig 1C, D) (23). These data confirm that PaKi cells are capable of mounting an antiviral response and highlight virus-specific sensitivities to IFN in this cellular background.
We next used total RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to profile the global transcriptional response of PaKi cells treated with IFNα over time (Fig 2A) . Transcriptome assembly analysis across all experimental conditions returned approximately 30,000 genes, of which 11,559 met a minimal read count threshold (mean log 2 CPM≥0). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that IFN induced 93 genes at 4h, 104 at 8h, 103 at 12h, and 103 at 24h (fold change (FC)≥1.5, FDR≤0.05) (Fig 2B) . There were 6 no downregulated genes at 4h, 2 at 8h, 105 at 12h, and 279 at 24h. However, statistical significance of upregulated genes was more robust than the statistical significance of the downregulated genes. Overall, IFN treatment of PaKi cells produced a positive gene induction signature.
Next, heat maps were generated to assess individual gene induction, using a cutoff of (24). Notably, we detected induction of GVIN1 (interferon-induced very large GTPase), which is predicted to encode a protein in bats but is annotated as a pseudogene in humans. This list also included transcripts predicted to encode an endogenous retrovirus (ERVK25) and several transcripts predicted to be long non-coding RNAs.
Differentially-expressed genes were cross-referenced to the INTERFEROME v2.0 database (25) to determine if they had previously been reported as IFN-induced genes. At the 4h and 8h time points, more than 80% of the genes in our data set overlapped with INTERFEROME v2.0. Since the INTEFEROME database consists predominantly of human and mouse data sets, this result suggests that antiviral responses in bat cells include a conserved repertoire of IFN-inducible genes commonly found in other mammalian species.
Differential temporal regulation of P. alecto ISGs. We next used a clustering algorithm to group genes in the RNA-Seq data set based on induction kinetics, without imposing fold change or FDR cutoffs (26). This analysis revealed that genes were organized into eight subclusters (SC) based on changes in expression levels throughout the IFN time course (Fig 3A) . Genes in SC1 and SC2 increased in expression after 8h. Genes in SC3 and SC4 were induced by 4h and peaked at 4-8h, with genes in SC3 returning close to baseline by 12h and SC4 genes remaining .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint elevated for at least 24h. These two SCs were highly-enriched for genes found in the INTERFEROME v2.0 database. Genes in SC5 increased slightly and peaked at 8h, returning to baseline levels by 12h. Levels of SC6 genes either increased or decreased by 4h, followed by decreased levels at 12-24h. SC7 gene expression levels decreased sharply by 8h, followed by a partial recovery by 12h and further decrease in expression by 24h. Finally, genes in SC8 exhibited a sustained decrease in expression levels starting at 8-12h. These data demonstrate that interferon induces distinct subsets of genes which are characterized by differing temporal expression patterns.
Orthogonal validation of RNA-Seq data. To validate our RNA-seq results, we used Nanostring nCounter technology, which uses colorimetrically-barcoded DNA probes for direct detection of mRNA without the use of nucleic acid amplification. A customized nCounter codeset was designed containing 50 genes from several temporal SCs, with a focus on the ISGrich SC3 and SC4 (Fig S2) . Temporal expression profiles using Nanostring were generally similar to the RNA-Seq data (Fig 3B) . SC1 and SC2 contained genes with increased expression levels at the later time points. SC3 and SC4 had genes with peak expression levels at 8h, with genes in SC4 exhibiting expression levels that remained elevated at 24h. Genes in SC8 decreased in expression over time, with the lowest expression levels observed at 24h.
Human vs Bat Temporal ISG Regulation. We next used Nanostring to compare temporal regulation of ISGs between bat and human cell lines. We first compared gene expression between PaKi and HEK293 as both cell lines are kidney-derived, but HEK293 cells responded poorly to type I IFN (Fig S1) . After screening for robust IFN responses in other human cell lines, we chose human A549 cells for comparative studies (Fig 4A) . A striking difference was observed between expression profiles of SC1 and SC2 when comparing PaKi and A549 cells.
Of the 5 selected genes in SC1 and SC2, none were significantly upregulated in IFN-treated .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint A549 cells. Similarly, the decreased expression levels observed for bat genes in SC8 were not observed in A549 cells.
For further analysis, we chose to focus on previously-reported ISGs, particularly those found in SC3 and SC4. When comparing changes in gene expression in SC3, the median foldchange of all genes in SC3 followed similar trends between bat and human cell lines (Fig 4B) . In SC4, however, genes from A549 cells exhibited higher fold induction and remained elevated at later time points when compared to PaKi cells.
We next determined the time point at which we observed maximum gene induction (t max ).
For both SC3 and SC4, approximately 80% of IFN-induced PaKi genes peaked at 8h ( Fig 4C) .
However, A549 genes had a bimodal pattern within both SCs, with most genes peaking at 4-8h and a smaller subset peaking at 12h or later.
To identify potential differences in induction kinetics, we calculated the percentage of genes that were induced to at least 50% of maximum expression for each time point. Greater than 80% of PaKi genes in both SCs were induced by 4h ( Fig 4D) . A549 genes in SC3 behaved similarly, although a small subset of genes was induced by 2h. However, approximately 40% of A549 genes in SC4 were induced by 2h, indicating faster induction of this subset of genes.
Genes in this list include HERC5, IFI6, IFIH1, MX1, NLRC5, OAS2, OASL, and PARP12.
Notably, PaKi cells express higher baseline levels of ISGs such that by full induction at 8h, PaKi cells express similar or greater mRNA counts compared to A549 cells, despite faster induction in A549 cells ( Fig 4D, Fig 4G, and Fig S1) .
Next, we calculated the percentage of genes that had recovered to below 50% of maximum expression for each time point. In both SCs, recovery occurred earlier in PaKi cells, with most genes recovering by 16h (Fig 4E) . In contrast, the expression levels for most A549 genes remained elevated throughout the time course. Together, these data suggest that the regulatory mechanisms governing IFN-mediated gene induction and maintenance of gene expression differs in each cell type, particularly with genes in SC4. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint It was recently reported that P. alecto tissues have constitutive and ubiquitous expression of IFNα, suggesting that bat cells may be primed to inhibit viral infection due to constitutive expression of certain ISGs (21) . Indeed, we observed overall higher ISG mRNA levels in unstimulated PaKi cells, particularly the SC4 genes ( Fig 4F) . In addition, we found that over half of SC4 PaKi ISGs were induced to higher maximum counts than corresponding A549 ISGs ( Fig 4G) .
Bat cells express multiple non-canonical ISGs, including an active RNASEL. Our gene expression profiling revealed several genes not previously reported to be ISGs. These included EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, SLC10A2, and SLC24A1 (Fig 2A) . In addition, we observed IFN-mediated induction of RNASEL, which encodes a 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetasedependent ribonuclease. This protein exerts its antiviral effect by degrading viral RNA in response to 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates, which are generated by the IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family of enzymes upon stimulation by dsRNA in the cytosol (27). In humans, RNASEL is a constitutively-expressed latent enzyme and is not IFN-inducible ( Fig 4A, Fig S1) (28). Interestingly, we observed a dose-dependent induction of RNASEL in IFNtreated PaKi cells ( Fig 5A) . Of note, similar mRNA expression levels of RNASEL were observed in unstimulated human and bat cell lines ( Fig 4F and Fig S1) . In addition, we observed IFNmediated RNASEL induction in brain-derived (PaBr) and lung-derived (PaLu) P. alecto cell lines ( Fig 5B) , suggesting IFN-mediated induction of RNASEL is not cell type-specific.
Next, we constructed RNASEL-deficient PaKi cells using CRISPR (29). Due to lack of a bat-specific RNASEL antibody, we were not able to monitor RNASEL protein levels. However, we detected modifications to the RNASEL gene in the PaKi knock-out bulk population (KO bulk) as compared to the parental wild-type (WT) population (Table S1 ). To test if RNASEL protein was functional, we activated RNASEL with poly (I:C) transfection after IFN or mock treatment and monitored RNA integrity ( Fig 5C) (30, 31). We observed rRNA degradation when cells were .

Treating cells with IFN for 24h to induce RNASEL expression before poly (I:C) transfection resulted in increased RNA degradation and accumulation of smaller products, suggesting increased RNASEL activity. The RNA degradation observed in the WT cells was reduced in the bulk KO cells. Together, these data indicate that bat RNASEL is a functional ribonuclease that, unlike its human ortholog, is IFN-inducible.
To test if the presence of RNASEL is important in the context of viral infection, we The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint
This study aimed to identify IFN-stimulated transcripts in the viral reservoir P. alecto.
Transcriptional analysis revealed over 100 genes induced in response to IFNα. Most of these genes have been previously described as ISGs, suggesting strong evolutionary conservation of the ISG pool, as would be predicted by previous genomic studies of immune genes in P. alecto (11, 16) .
We have provided a framework of P. alecto ISG induction, organized by early, mid, and late responses to type I IFN. Our data set reveal a previously unappreciated subtlety in the temporal induction and regulation of ISG expression. A recent study of IFN-inducible gene kinetics in mouse cells reported a profile that resembles a combination of our SC3 and SC4 data sets (32). Our study further refines this kinetic analysis by delineating two separate ISG pools based on unique temporal induction profiles. While both SCs are characterized by similar peak mRNA levels and a subsequent decline by 12-24 hours, SC4 contained some genes that remained elevated. These genes may offer residual antiviral protection, even when IFN signaling has returned to basal levels. In addition, many genes in SC4 have both higher baseline and higher maximal induction levels in bat cells compared to human cells, which could contribute to species-specific differences in susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying unique expression of certain ISGs in bats cells.
Compared to human cells, bat cells have a more rapid decline in ISG levels, suggesting tightlyregulated expression kinetics. The reason for this strict transcriptional regulation remains unclear, but such a mechanism may exist to prevent excessive inflammation in a highly metabolically active host (11) .
We also identified several previously unrecognized, or non-canonical ISGs, including RNASEL. The OAS/RNASEL pathway consists of OAS proteins that recognize viral dsRNA and subsequently catalyze the formation of short oligoadenylates that act as second messengers to activate the constitutively-expressed latent enzyme RNASEL, which degrades viral genetic Additional studies will be needed to determine whether these non-canonical bat ISGs contribute to unique viral resistance in bats. It is also possible that canonical bat ISGs have evolved unique effector functions that contribute to reduced viral susceptibility. Uncovering mechanisms of bat ISGs will provide insight into the innate immune responses of an important viral reservoir and may inform research and development of antiviral therapies.
