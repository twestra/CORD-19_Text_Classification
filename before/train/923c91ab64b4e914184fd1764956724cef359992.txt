Article Summary: SARS-CoV-2 has similar replication kinetics to SARS-CoV, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type I interferon treatment.
Abstract 1 SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 2 viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both 3 group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in 4 bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform 5 treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) 6
sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while 7 SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel 8
CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation 9 and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN 10 induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-11
CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence 12 of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS-13
CoV-2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS-CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation 14 late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in 15 viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b 16 and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain 17 equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in 18 susceptibility to the IFN-I response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. that could help 19 inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. 20
With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 disease, differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and the 22 original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment 23
options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development 24
as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early 25 during infection.
At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a 28 viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Hunnan seafood market in 29
Wuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 30 (SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century (1). The 2019 etiologic 31 agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-32
CoV-2 (2). The new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the 33 corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease 34 including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme 35
cases (3, 4) . In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50 36 years old), health status, and health care workers, similar to both SARS and . 37
Together, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the 38 original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier. 39
In the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize 40 the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted (6) and 41 subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human 42 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as 8) . 43
Extensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen 44 with SARS-CoV (5). Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and 45
were not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment 46 guidance has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 47 major antigenic determinate (13). Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in 52 responding to the newest CoV outbreak. 53
The host Innate immune response is initiated when viral products are recognized by host 54 cell pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors 55 (RLRs) (14, 15) . This response ultimately results in production of IFN-I and other cytokines, 56 which together are essential for an effective antiviral response (16). IFN-I then triggers its own 57 signaling cascade via its receptor, in autocrine or paracrine manner, which induces 58 phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. 59
Together, STAT1, STAT2, and a third transcription factor, IRF9, form the Interferon Stimulated 60
Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which is essential for induction of many IFN-stimulated genes 61 (ISGs), and ultimately and effective antiviral response (17, 18) . To establish productive 62 replication, viruses have developed different mechanisms to escape this antiviral response 63 targeting different parts of the IFN-I response machinery (19) . 64
In this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-65
CoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication 66 kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is 67 much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. Examining further, we 68 determined that SARS-CoV-2 induces STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression, which is 69 absent in SARS-CoV. Similarly, infection of IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells resulted in reduced 70 SARS-Cov-2 replication and STAT1 phosphorylation at late times. These results suggest 71 distinct changes between the CoVs in terms of IFN antagonism and we subsequently examined 72 sequence homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that may be 73 responsible for these differences. Together, the results suggest SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same 74 capacity to control the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV. 75
Our initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to 78 explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection, 79
we find that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48 hours 80 post infection (Fig. 1A) . While SARS-CoV-2 titer had slightly lower viral titers at 24 hours post 81 infection, the results were statistically different between the novel CoV and the original epidemic 82 strain. By 48 hours, replication of both viruses had plateaued and significant cytopathic effect 83 (CPE) was observed for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together, the results 84 indicated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar replication kinetics in Vero E6 85
We next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment. Treatment 87 with IFN-I (recombinant IFNα) has been attempted as an antiviral approach for a wide variety of 88 pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV (20). During both the SARS and 89 MERS-CoV outbreaks, IFN-I has been employed with limited effect (21, 22) . In this study, we 90 pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 units of recombinant IFN-I (IFN-α) 18 hours prior to infection. 91
Vero E6 lack the capacity to produce IFN-I, but are able to respond to exogenous treatment 92 (23). Following pretreatment with IFN-I, SARS-CoV infection has a modest reduction in viral 93 titer (1.5 log plaque forming units (PFU) as compared to untreated control 24 hours post 94 infection (Fig. 1B) . However, by 48 hours, SARS-CoV has nearly equivalent viral yields as the 95 untreated conditions (7.2 log PFU versus 7.5 log PFU). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 shows a 96 significant reduction in viral replication following IFN-I treatment. At both 24 and 48 hours post 97 infection, SARS-CoV-2 had massive 3-log (24 HPI) and 4-log (48 HPI) drops in viral titer as 98 compared to control untreated cells. Finally, we examined viral protein production finding a 99 major deficit in nucleocapsid protein production in IFN-I treated cells following SARS-CoV-2 100 infection (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, viral proteins were robustly expressed for SARS-CoV-2 in 101 untreated cells and for SARS-CoV in both conditions. Together, the results demonstrate a clear 102 sensitivity to a primed IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2, which is not observed with SARS-CoV. 103 SARS-CoV-2 fails to attenuate STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG production. 104
To explore differences in IFN-I antagonism between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, we examined 105 both STAT1 activation and IFN stimulated gene (ISG) expression following IFN pretreatment 106 and infection. Examining Vero cell protein lysates, we found that IFN-I treated cells infected with 107 SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT-1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2) . STAT1 108 phosphorylation was absent in untreated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and suggest the novel 109
CoV is unable to inhibit a IFN-I preprimed response. In contrast, SARS-CoV had no evidence 110 for STAT1 phosphorylation in either IFN-I treated or untreated cells, illustrating robust control 111 over IFN-I induction pathways. Examining further, STAT1, IFIT2, and TRIM25, known ISGs (17), 112 had increased protein expression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection following IFN 113 pretreatment (Fig. 2) . Basal STAT1 and TRIM25 levels are reduced during SARS-CoV and 114 SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to control likely due to the mRNA targeting activity of non-115 structural protein 1 (NSP1) (24). However, IFN-I treatment results in augmented protein levels 116
for both ISGs following SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to untreated control. In contrast, 117 IFN treated SARS-CoV had no significant increase in ISG protein relative to control infection. 118
Together, the STAT1 phosphorylation, ISG production, and viral protein levels indicate that 119 SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to modulate a primed type I IFN response as the original 120
While capable of responding to exogenous type I IFN, Vero cells lack the capacity to 123 produce type I IFN following infection which likely plays a role in robust replication of a wide 124 range of viruses []. To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 in a type I IFN responsive cell type, we infected 125 Calu3 2B4 cells, a lung epithelial cell line sorted for ACE2 expression and previously used in 126 coronavirus and influenza research (25). Using an MOI of 1, we examined the viral replication 127 kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV in Calu3 cells. We found that both SARS-CoV 128 and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar overall kinetics, peaking 24 hours post infection (Fig.  129   3A) . However, SARS-CoV-2 replication is slightly attenuated relative to SARS-CoV at 24 hours 130 post infection (0.82 log reduction). The attenuation in viral replication expands at 48 hours (1.4 131 log reduction) indicating a significant change in total viral titers between SARS-CoV and SARS-132
CoV-2. Notably, no similar attenuation was observed in untreated Vero cells (Fig. 1A ) 133
suggesting possible immune modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 134
To further evaluate type I IFN induction, we examined both STAT1 phosphorylation and 135 ISG expression following infection of Calu3 2B4 cells at 48 hours. Examining Calu3 cell protein 136 lysates, we found cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT-1 by 48 hours 137 post infection (Fig. 3B) . These results correspond to type I IFN treated Vero cell findings (Fig.  138 2) and suggest that the novel CoV is unable to completely inhibit the IFN-I response. In contrast, 139 SARS-CoV had no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation Calu3 cells, illustrating robust control 140 over IFN-I induction pathways. Similar to the Vero IFN pretreatment, augmented levels of total 141 STAT1 was observed in SARS-CoV-2 relative SARS-CoV, although with not as dramatic an 142 increase. Similarly, TRIM25 was found to be reduced in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 143
indicating that both viruses disrupt host protein production, likely due to mRNA antagonism by 144
CoV NSP1 (24). Overall, the data from Calu3 cells confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to 145 maintain similar control over the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV. 146
Considering the sensitivity to IFN-I, we next sought to evaluate changes between SARS-CoV 148 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Previous work has established several key IFN antagonist in 149 the SARS-CoV genome including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others (26). Therefore, we 150 .

Using sequence analysis, we found several changes to SARS-CoV-2 that potentially 153 contribute to its type I IFN sensitivity (Fig. 4) . ORF3b, all five surveyed group 2B CoVs maintain ORF6; however, SARS-CoV-2 had only 69% 171 homology with SARS-CoV while the other three group 2B bat CoVs had >90% conservation. 172
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has a two amino acid truncation in its ORF6; previous work has found 173 that alanine substitution in this C-terminal of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in ablated antagonism 174 (32). Together, the sequence homology analysis suggests that differences in NSP3, ORF3b, 175 and/or ORF6 may be key drivers of SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN susceptibility. 176 .

With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains 178
a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus. In this report, we describe differences in 
For SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity to IFN-I indicates a distinction from SARS-CoV and 218 suggests differential host innate immune modulation between the viruses. The loss of ORF3b 219 and truncation/changes in ORF6 could signal a reduced capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to interfere 220 with type I IFN responses. For SARS-CoV ORF6, the N-terminal domain has been shown to 221 have a clear role in its ability to disrupt karyopherin transport (32); in turn, the loss of ORF6 222 function for SARS-CoV-2 would likely render it much more susceptible to IFN-I pretreatment as 223 activated STAT1 has the capacity to enter the nucleus and induce ISGs and the antiviral 224 response. In these studies, we have found that following IFN-I pretreatment, STAT1 225 phosphorylation is induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increase in ISG proteins 226 .

For SARS-CoV ORF3b, the viral protein has been shown to 228 disrupt phosphorylation of IRF3, a key transcriptional factor in the induction of IFN-I and the 229 antiviral state (31). While its mechanism of action is not clear, the ORF3b absence in SARS-230
CoV-2 infection likely impacts its ability to inhibit the IFN-I response and eventual STAT1 231 activation. Similarly, while NSP3 deubiquitinating domain remains intact, SARS-CoV-2 has a 24 232 AA insertion upstream of this deubiquitinating domain that could potentially alter that function 233 (30). While other antagonists are maintained with high levels of conservation (>90%), single 234 point mutations in key locations could modify function and contribute to increased IFN 235 sensitivity. Overall, the sequence analysis suggests that differences between SARS-CoV and 236 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins may drive attenuation in the context of type I IFN pretreatment. 237
The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 suggests utility in treatment using type I IFN. 238
While IFN-I has been used in response to chronic viral infection (41), previous examination of 239 SARS-CoV cases found inconclusive effect for type I IFN treatment (42). However, the findings 240 from the SARS-CoV outbreak were complicated by combination therapy of type I IFN with other 241 treatments including ribavirin/steroids and lack of a regimented protocol. While type I IFN has 242 been utilized to treat MERS-CoV infected patients, no conclusive data yet exists to determine 243 efficacy (43). Yet, in vivo studies with MERS-CoV has found that early induction with type I IFN 244
can be protective in mice (44); importantly, the same study found that late type I IFN induction 245 can be detrimental for MERS-CoV disease (44). Similarly, early reports have described 246 treatments using type I IFN in combination for SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the efficacy of these 247 treatments and the parameters of their use are not known (45). Overall, sensitivity data suggest 248 that type I IFN treatment may have utility for treating SARS-CoV-2 if the appropriate parameters 249
can be determined. In addition, use of type III IFN, which is predicted to have utility in the 250 respiratory tract, could offer another means for effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. 251 .

For SARS-CoV, mouse models that recapitulate human disease 253 were developed through virus passage in immune competent mice (46). Similarly, mouse 254 models for MERS-CoV required adaptation in mice that had genetic modifications of their 255 dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for 48) . However, each of these 256 MERS-CoV mouse models still retained full immune capacity. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 257 sensitivity to type I IFN may signal the need to use an immune deficient model to develop 258 relevant disease. While initial work has suggested incompatibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in 259 mice based on receptor usage (8), the type I IFN response may be a second major barrier that 260 needs to be overcome. Similar to the emergent Zika virus outbreak, the use of type I IFN 261 receptor knockout mice or type I IFN receptor blocking antibody may be necessary to develop a 262 useful SARS-CoV-2 animal models for therapeutic testing (49). 263
Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher sensitivity to type I IFN 264 than the previously emergent SARS-CoV. This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to 265 changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains. Moving forward, these data 266 could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing 267 novel animal models of disease. In this ongoing outbreak, the results also highlight a distinction 268 between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for 269 SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.
