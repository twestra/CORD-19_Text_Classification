Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health 29 impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. 30
Both transmission rates and the critical 0 R threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive 31
number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported 32 case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public 33 health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and 34 space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and 35
spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is 36 either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. 37
We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this 38 assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model 39 accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations of these parameters to a few 40 examples of different types of shifting influences acting on detection, depending on the 41 likely sensitivity of surveillance systems to errors from sources such as clinical testing 42 rates and differences in healthcare-seeking behavior from the public over time. Finally, 43
we discuss the implications of these corrections for both historical and current outbreaks. 44 45

we discuss the implications of these corrections for both historical and current outbreaks. However, many of these models make an explicit assumption that detection of new 67 disease incidence is a function of well-understood confounders that remain mostly 68 invariant over the course of an outbreak, such as the probability of an infected person 69 developing symptoms. There are known corrections for instances that violate this 70 assumption of constant detectability, such as when clinical case definition criteria are 71 critical in instances where estimated case incidence does not accurately reflect numbers 117 of infections (i.e. when case fatality rates and infection fatality rates differ significantly). 118
In effect, modeling efforts should be split into separate endeavors: one of curve fitting for 119 observed incidence, and one of inferring from those curves the likely underlying, actual 120 disease process. 121
To capture this coupled process of disease dynamics and disease detection, we consider a 123 standard, simple epidemiological model, but incorporate the potential for errors derived 124 from a variety of sources that confound our estimates of case incidence. We use these 125 models to demonstrate how these corrections would alter our understanding of historical 126 outbreaks, and then discuss some evidence that modern outbreaks are affected by the 127 types of behavioral shifts that we consider. 128 129 130
We begin with a standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) system, however, we 132 will examine both "real" process of actual pathogen spread (denoted by the subscript a), 133 and a "perceived" or "measured" process (denoted by the subscript m). For simplicity 134 sake, we will assume that correct diagnosis and treatment has no bearing on the duration 135 of illness/ recovery time, nor on the rates of transmission from infected to susceptible 136 individuals. Although both of these are obviously false for most outbreaks, they allow us 137 to highlight the processes and methods most relevant to our purpose here and are easily 138 corrected in specific application to particular outbreaks in the future.

) (t i a , and ) (t r a are the fractions of the populations 143 in the respective health categories at time t. To build the perceived disease process from 144 this model, we then incorporate rates of testing for each fraction of the population, and 145 the sensitivity and specificity of the test as follows. 146 147 Importantly, we will define as susceptible any person one who is not infected with our the 148 pathogen of concern, despite possible infection with another illness. It is therefore not 149 only reasonable but probable that "susceptible people" will seek out health care services 150 and be tested for infection under our surveillance process, especially if the symptoms of 151 their infection closely match those of the pathogen causing our focal outbreak. We 152 therefore define α to be the rate at which susceptible people are tested for illness, call δ 153 the rate at which infected people are tested for illness, and call λ the rate at which 154 recovered people are tested for illness. (For purposes of this paper, we will assume 155 λ α = , however this assumption may be relaxed in future work if memory of recently 156 resolved symptoms affects health care seeking behavior). We define the false positive 157 rate of the diagnostic test 1 ε and the false negative rate of the test 2 ε (these may apply 158 either to clinical diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, or else to error rates stemming 159 from differences in physician opinion during syndromic surveillance). 160 161 .

While this might at first seem straightforward, there arises the complication that 172 our health care seeking behavior functions are likely to be problematic in at least three 173 separate ways: (1) they are likely to be functions of the current perceived prevalence of 174 infection in the population (i.e. some function of m i ), (2) they are likely to be functions of 175 time since the beginning of the perception of the current outbreak, (3) they are likely to 176 be non-linear and, in some cases, not even continuous. We therefore propose the 177 following algorithm to produce a system of SIR curves which reflect the underlying 178 disease dynamics without the influence of behavioral shifts and/or testing inaccuracy; we 179 will denote this system as "Testing Neutral", TN. 180
We start from the most conservative assumption: that only the epidemiological rates of 182 m β and γ for the outbreak curve of interest are known (i.e. that the raw data to which an 183 .

We make this 184 assumption to provide a method by which analysis of previously published rates for 185 historical outbreaks could be analyzed without having to reanalyze the original outbreak 186 data (should that data in fact be accessible, the correction can naturally be applied 187 directly to the m i data directly rather than to * i curve described below). We, therefore, 188 begin with an initially reconstructed SIR system (denoted by *) using only our measured 189 identical, we see that asymmetry in error type rates alone can drastically alter our 220 understanding of an ongoing outbreak (Fig. 1a) . Extending this simple case to also 221 include behavioral responses that shift over the course of an outbreak (i.e. non-constant 222 testing rates), while still keeping all else the same, we see also that there can be drastic 223 errors, even in the understood shape of the incidence curve to match the cases observed 224 (Fig. 1b) .

This is done to 231 highlight the problem, though of course, real-world values are expected to be within a 232 much narrower, more conservative range. from an idealized instructional case, when we incorporate both testing rate dependence 243 on perceived prevalence and the amount of time since surpassing the threshold for 244 increased behavioral demand for testing (e.g. gradual relaxation in public risk perception 245 over time), the differences between the reality of the disease dynamics and the 246 understanding that would be provided by fitting a model to case incidence data is even 247 greater (Fig 2b) . 248 249 .

When the ratio of the diagnosis tests is non-constant the results are more 324 complicated, but some results are still accessible: without errors in diagnostic tests, a 325 surveillance system can wrongly report no disease incidence while actual case incidence 326 is either increasing or decreasing. Further, with small errors in the diagnostic tests it is 327 possible for a surveillance system to report decreasing incidence while the actual 328 The ability to accurately infer epidemiological rates from outbreak data is critical to a 334 majority of our public health planning efforts.

Regardless of the particular mechanism through which we attempt to characterize the 339 changes in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, our results demonstrate (in both theory 340 and practice) how these dynamics may be incorporated into epidemiological modeling 341 efforts and how the results may translate into a more accurate understanding of infectious 342 disease dynamics. 343 344 Some studies have been able to assess the impact of public health announcement-or 345 media-driven behavioral change with regard to disease risk and diagnosis (e.g. (Sharma et 346 al. 2003) ). It is clear that we will need to develop better models that explicitly capture the 347 major factors that can effect change in public behavior regarding health care and 348 diagnosis. While it may be impossible to accurately assess the impact of behavioral 349 changes in health care seeking behavior for past epidemics, one possible course of action 350 going forwards would be to ask physicians, hospitals and laboratories to record and report 351 the number of tests performed in addition to merely the number of cases positively 352 diagnosed, regardless of acknowledge threat of outbreaks. 353 354 These models and insights may also be of critical use our collective ongoing efforts to 355 understand and predict the progression of COVID-19. Not only do we provide the 356 obvious alternations to the standard epidemic predictions for error rates in testing, we 357 also provide a mechanism by which to correct our understanding of 0 R based on changes 358 in access to tests of various sensitivities and specificities over time.

While presented here with 362 constant rates to enable the analytic calculations, real-time estimations of 0 R are 363 frequently based on numerical solutions, rather than analytic calculations. In this case, the 364 expansion of precisely these equations to allow for α , δ , and λ to themselves be 365 dynamic functions of public perception and disease prevalence will enable vastly more 366 accurate understanding of real-time case incidence data. Work currently underway to try 367 and capture the functional forms of these responses in observed behaviors in the US will 368 hopefully allow us to extend these results very soon to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 369
itself, but we provide this model in the meanwhile to allow others to work in parallel and 370 improve our real-time decision-support capabilities. 371 372 .
