14 15 Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has extended its range of transmission in all 16 parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of 17 associated disease. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to 18 control further spread. 19 Methods: We evaluate whether and under which conditions containment or slowing down 20 COVID-19 epidemics are possible by isolation and contact tracing in settings with various 21 levels of social distancing. We use a stochastic transmission model in which every person 22 .

Findings: The proportion of asymptomatic or unascertained cases has a strong impact on the 29 controllability of the disease. If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 30 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving 31 containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household 32 contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and 33 isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are 34 necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of social 35 Research in context 46 Evidence before this study 47 As of 8 April 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to more than 170 48 countries and has caused near 90,000 deaths of COVID-19 worldwide. In the absence of 49 effective medicines and vaccines, the preventive measures are limited to social distancing, 50 isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and identification and quarantining of their 51 contacts. Evidence suggests that a substantial portion of transmission may occur before the 52 onset of symptoms and before cases can be isolated, and that many cases remain 53 unascertained. This has potentially important implications for the prospect of containment 54 by combinations of these measures. 55 Added value of this study 56 Using a stochastic transmission model armed with current best estimates of epidemiological 57 parameters, we evaluated under which conditions containment could be achieved with 58 combinations of social distancing, isolation and contact tracing. We investigated the level of 59 social distancing needed for containment, and how an additional implementation of 60 isolation and contact tracing may likely help to in reducing the effective reproduction 61 number to below 1, the critical threshold. We analyzed what proportion of household and 62 non-household contacts need to be isolated effectively to achieve containment depending 63 on the level of social distancing in the population. We estimated the impact of combinations 64 of these measures on epidemic growth rate and doubling time for the number of infections. 5 household contacts is sufficient, depends on levels of social distancing and timeliness of 68 tracing and isolation. 69 Implications of all the available evidence 70 Our analyses based on best understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, highlight that 71 if social distancing is not complete, isolation and contact tracing at least of household 72 contacts can help to delay and lower the epidemic peak. High levels of timely contact 73 tracing of household and non-household contacts may be sufficient to control the epidemic. 74 Introduction 75 As of early April 2020, the number of infections of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still 76 increasing at an exponential rate in many countries, while the virus is expanding its range to 77 all parts of the world. There are no registered effective medicines, treatment options are 78 mainly supportive, and there are no vaccines available, limiting preventive measures mainly 79 to social distancing combined with isolation of infected persons and those that have high 80 likelihood of being infected, for instance because they have been traced as contacts of 81 infected persons [1, 2] . However, recently it was questioned by high-ranked officials of the 82 World Health Organization (WHO) whether social distancing or lockdowns are sufficient to 83 stop the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-84 who-ryan/lockdowns-not-enough-to-defeat-coronavirus-whos-ryan-idUSKBN2190FM). 85 Possibly, additional measures are needed, for example active tracing of contacts in 86 combination with isolation of infected contacts. Also, such measures will be important in the To what extent local containment or local slowing down of an epidemic by isolation and 92 contact tracing is successful depends on the fraction of infections that remain asymptomatic 93 or have mild disease, and on the infectiousness before the onset of symptoms [4, 5] . It is 94 known that a high probability of asymptomatic infection, a high proportion of transmission 95 occurring before the onset of symptoms, a long delay between case finding and isolation, 96 and high overall transmissibility all factor in negatively in the likelihood that an outbreak can 97 7 be contained [6] [7] [8] [9] . For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected 98 persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of 99 infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms (up to 80%), and that the We focus on conditions that make containment of an early epidemic possible, but also on 114 the impact of isolation and contact tracing when containment is not possible, or in an exit 115 phase from social distancing. In a population with social distancing in place, we investigate 116 what the additional impact of isolation and contact tracing can be for reaching containment 117 or slowing down the spread. We report effective reproduction number, the (exponential) 118 rate of increase, and the doubling time of the epidemic for scenarios with various 119 combinations of interventions.

As it is likely that, on the 122 one hand, isolation and contact tracing will be more effective in close contact settings with 123 well-defined contacts (household, workplace) than in the community (commuting, public Table 1) . We distinguish 139 between household contacts and non-household contacts, which differ in the risk of 140 infection and the delay and effectiveness of tracing and isolation. Intervention effectiveness 141 is determined by the daily probability of being diagnosed during the infectious period (Table   142 2). Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on the delays in tracing household and 143 non-household contacts, respectively, and the proportions of contacts can be found and 144 isolated. We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons cannot transmit any Natural history 150 We assume that the latent period lasts between 1 and 3 days. Individuals then become 151 infectious for at most 10 days. Infectivity is high at the beginning of the infectious period 152 and decays to low levels during these 10 days ( Figure S1a ). The probability of symptoms 153 onset increases during the first 4 days of the infectious period, thereby influencing the daily 154 probability of diagnosis during the infectious period (see below).

We model the daily number of household contacts with a Poisson distribution, 157 and the numbers of non-household contacts with a negative binomial distribution (Table 1) , 158 with parameters based on the average household size in the Netherlands, and numbers of 159 contacts observed in a contact study in the Netherlands (FigureS1b) [20] . With the chosen 160 parameters, the mean number of contacts per day is 13.2 (SD 8.5). 161 On each day of the infectious period, an individual makes a number of contacts according to 162 the contact distribution. This number is reduced by a factor describing the probability that 163 the contact person has already been infected during earlier contacts with the index person. 164 More precisely, the number of contacts is reduced by a factor fk per day k of the infectious 165 period, describing the probability that a contact has already been infected on previous days 166 of the infectious period of the index case. The probability of transmission upon contact with 167 a susceptible household contact is given by the distribution in Figure S1a . As contacts with 168 persons outside the household are often less close, we assume that the transmission 169 probability for these contacts is lower by factor 0.25.

This is implemented by a reduction factor in the mean of the negative binomial 179 distribution describing non-household contact numbers. The reduction factor for social 180 distancing was varied between 0% and 95%. In scenarios with social distancing we assumed 181 that only 60% of cases are symptomatic or can be ascertained. If an individual is diagnosed, contacts will be traced, and in case they are infected will be 199 diagnosed and isolated.

These parameters, tracing delay and tracing 202 coverage, may be different for household and non-household contacts. We assume that all 203 traced infected persons are immediately isolated and cannot transmit any further. 204 Therefore, the only individuals who will continue transmitting are those who are not found 205 by tracing and are not yet diagnosed.
Baseline scenario 208 For assessing the effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation, we use a best case scenario, 209 where all parameters are set to optimistic values. We assume that when a case is diagnosed, 210 he/she will immediately be isolated and this will stop onward transmission completely. 211 Furthermore, we assume that all contacts will be traced, and if found infected will be 212 isolated immediately. We assume that it takes 1 day to find and isolate both household and 213 non-household contacts. The rationale for using these overly optimistic assumptions as a 214 baseline is that we want to investigate the maximum contribution contact tracing can 215 provide for achieving containment. In sensitivity analyses we investigated for various control 216 parameters at which point of diverging from the baseline parameters control of the 217 outbreak will be lost (Supplementary Information).
Output variables 220 We compute cumulative numbers of cases for a time period of 50 days after the epidemic 221 has reached more than 100 cases. We compare doubling time of the epidemic with only 222 isolation of diagnosed cases to situations with various levels of social distancing, isolation 223 and contact tracing. We assume that all diagnosed cases are isolated upon diagnosis and 224 .
