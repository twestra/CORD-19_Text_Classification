 Alongside age, pre-existing medical conditions are perceived negatively during triage assessments, particularly if rare, and/or theoretically expected to influence cardiorespiratory risk;
 Anaesthetists use cardiopulmonary exercise testing to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independently to diagnostic labels, but this is not feasible in acute settings;
 Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are an exemplar of a condition where, due to expected or measured abnormalities (hypoxaemia-low PaO2 SpO2), poor physiological capacity might be predicted.
 Neither age nor usual SpO2 predicted lower/higher risk categories by anaerobic threshold, but haemoglobin-dependent indices of oxygen delivery to the tissues were associated with higher risk, offering opportunities for improvement by attention to anaemia and aerobic conditioning;
 Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings: the 13point VSAQ Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment.
Abstract 1 2 BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing 3 medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 4 to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not 5 feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for 6 cardiorespiratory risk. 7 METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with 8 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise.
9 Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from 10 underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point 11 Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-12 planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific 13 variables.
14 RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 15 (median 12.35) ml.min -1 kg -1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min -16 1 kg -1 category suggested as "lower-risk" for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 17 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, 18 despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 19 to 183 (median 156)g.L -1 . However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and 20 oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase 21 of 25g.L -1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the 22 VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk 23 evaluations through a simple questionnaire.
24 CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings.
These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The
VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during 27 triage/screening.

Such decisions are based on factors such as age 34 and pre-existing medical conditions, in addition to acute observations and measurements. With the 35 exception of certain common disease states, there is little evidence regarding associations with specific 36 infections or complication risks. Diagnostic labels are generally linked under a single, negative 37 umbrella of "pre-existing medical conditions". There is particular concern that as for health insurance, 38 lack of familiarity with rare diseases may lead to an inappropriately negative weighting, with no time 39 to redress in an acute triage setting.
In pre-operative assessments, anaesthetists increasingly use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 42 to identify patients who may be unable to appropriately respond to increased cardiorespiratory demands 43 of surgery due to reduced cardiorespiratory reserve.[1,2] The CPET-derived measure of anaerobic 44 threshold (AT) of <11 ml.min -1 kg -1 has been identified in multiple studies and systematic reviews to 45 be associated with adverse outcomes, mortality, and longer lengths of stay in a variety of surgeries, 46 including intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic procedures.[2-4 ] The AT represents the point where ATP 47 generation cannot be met by mitochondrial metabolism. It is considered a good measure as it reflects 48 oxygen delivery and patient conditioning, and is not dependent on the patient's motivation during 49 exercise.[2] 50 51 The rapid assessment tool selected for evaluation was the Veteran's Specific Activity Questionnaire 52 (VSAQ [5]). This is a simple 13-point scale of activities of increasing difficulty whereby the user 53 indicates which activity normally causes them to stop when performed for a period of time.[5] The 54 activities correspond to metabolic equivalents (METs), and numerous studies show a good correlation 55 with AT derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing [6-8], mortality [9] and postoperative 56 complications [10].

We focussed on one particular rare disease that provides an instructive example of potentially over-59 called cardiorespiratory risk. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal vascular 60 connections between pulmonary arteries and veins, resulting in an anatomic right-to-left shunt. [11] 61 Patients with pulmonary AVMs can demonstrate pronounced physiological abnormalities, including 62 significant hypoxaemia, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] increased minute ventilation ( V̇E) for given increases in CO2 63 production (V̇E/ V̇CO2 slope) [16, 17] , high cardiac output states [19], and often iron deficiency and 64 anaemia due to inadequate replacement of haemorrhagic iron losses from underlying hereditary 65 haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [20, 21] There is no published guidance on management of 66 individuals with pulmonary AVMs or HHT undergoing anaesthesia, and each year, our service receives 67 requests regarding suitability for surgery and insurance, and/or reports that surgery or insurance has 68 been withheld because of the perceived risks of pulmonary AVMs/HHT.
Our goal was to evaluate commonly used assessment criteria and examine the potential role for a rapid 71 assessment tool that could distinguish lower risk individuals in an emergency setting, based on usual 72 cardiorespiratory status. The detailed study aims were to explore which variables may be associated 73 with cardiorespiratory risk defined by the anaerobic threshold in order to inform triage and develop 74 approaches to help guide pre-exposure [23] or pre-operative [1-4,10] management. Having recently 75 applied the VSAQ to observational studies in patients with pulmonary AVMs and HHT, [17,18] we 76 hypothesised that this could prove to be a useful risk categorising tool for triage purposes across wider 77 patient groups. 78 79 80 Methods 81 General patient evaluations 82 With ethical approvals (Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Research Ethics Committee 83 (LREC 2000/5792), patient indices derived as part of the clinical assessment process in a pulmonary 84 All rights reserved.

Veteran's Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) 98
The VSAQ was administered as part of routine clinical care to patients for independent completion, 99 using a modified version as presented in Figure 1 . Patient First, the higher risk groups had a trend towards lower haemoglobin, although there was some overlap 176 in confidence intervals. Categorised by an anaerobic threshold delimiter of 11 ml.min -1 kg -1 , the mean 177 [95% CI] values were 159 [14.9, 17 .0] g.L -1 for the low risk group compared to 144 [13.1, 15.6] g.L -1 higher risk group ( Table 2) .
representing the oxygen content per unit volume of arterial blood, and calculated based on the oxygen 184 carriage of 1.34mls per gram of fully saturated haemoglobin: Categorised by an anaerobic threshold 185 delimiter of 11 ml.min -1 .kg -1 , the mean [95% CI] values were 19. 6[18.4, 21 .0] ml.dL -1 for the low risk 186 group, but 17.4 [15.8, 19 .0] ml.dL -1 for the high risk group (Table 1, Figure 3) . Categorised by the 187 upper/lower 50 th percentiles, the means [95% CI] were 19. 6 [18.1, 21 .0] ml.L -1 for the lower risk group 188 but only 17.8 [16.4, 19 .3] ml.L -1 for the higher risk group ( Table 2) .

Anaemia is very common, and readily correctable in clinical practice. We modelled whether increasing 198 haemoglobin alone might allow patients to move from a high to lower risk category. In multivariate 199 regression analysis, haemoglobin explained 57.3% of the variance in log-transformed AT (adjusted R 2 200 0.57). The regression coefficient of 0.053 (95% confidence interval 0.005, 0.100, p=0.031) implied that 201 for each 1 g.dL -1 (10 g./L -1 ) rise in haemoglobin, the AT would rise by 0.76 ml.min -1 .kg -1 , and a 202 haemoglobin rise of 2.5 g.dL -1 would increase AT by 1.9 ml.min -1 .kg -1 , moving 7 (63.6%) of patients 203 from high to low risk. In the existing dataset, it was not possible to preselect all patients who would 204 benefit using single resting demographics (data not shown).
Other measurements that were associated with the higher risk status were higher serum bicarbonate and most pulmonary AVM patients would not fall into a high risk category because in the absence of other 249 diseases, individuals with pulmonary AVMs rarely complain of respiratory symptoms. [14, 17, 22] 250 Compensatory mechanisms are so effective that in one study, work rate and oxygen consumption on 251 maximal CPET did not improve following embolisation treatments that obliterated the pulmonary 252 AVM(s) and improved SpO2. [16] However, the issue is how best to capture this good exercise 253 tolerance. We have previously reported the ease of use with the VSAQ in a pre-assessment clinic. [18] 254
We have now adjusted to send the VSAQ to patients by email so they can report back the lowest number 255 at which they needed to stop at a subsequent teleconsultation, thus conveying complex physiological 
Potential mechanisms for the association between lower anaerobic threshold and less successful surgical 261 outcomes have been put forward, including the suggestion that regular exercise stimulates ischaemic 262 preconditioning and lessens surgical demand by enabling the body to adjust to ischaemia and better 263 utilise oxygen. Additionally, endurance exercise has been found to increase mitochondrial mass, which 264 can therefore delay the start of anaerobic respiration by enhancing the utilisation of oxygen by 265 mitochondria. [6] "Prehabilitation" or pre-operative exercise therapy has been found to improve post-266 operative outcomes in other disease groups and has been proposed to help prepare for COVID-19 267 infection. [23] Herein we also show that addressing anaemia is likely to be an additional strategy to 268 reduce cardiorespiratory risk status.
In summary, high proportions of patients with a label that might be expected to mean "pre-existing 271 cardiorespiratory condition" do not fall into classical high risk categories when more carefully 272 evaluated.
