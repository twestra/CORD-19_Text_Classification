Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not 25 predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC 26 antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest 27 it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could 28 influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of 29 Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified 30 antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly 31 distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow 32 growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the 33 population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, 34 many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance 35 without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as 36 Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant 37 combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly 38 tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels.
Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia 40 displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. 41 Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help 42 predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may 43 provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome 44 persistent clinical candidemia.

Some infections are recalcitrant to drug treatment due to 'resistance', which 52 refers to microbial growth in the presence of drug concentrations that inhibit susceptible 53 isolates 1,2 . Susceptibility is commonly measured as the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 54 after 24 h of growth in the presence of drug 3,4 . Fungal infections generally follow the "90/60" rule 55 for predicting therapeutic outcomes based on in vitro susceptibility testing: ~90% of susceptible 56 isolates and 60% of resistant isolates respond to therapy 5-9 . This implies that infection 57 outcomes are influenced by host factors as well as features of the pathogen that are not 58 reflected by the MIC 10,11 . In effect, organisms that cause persistent infections, defined as those 59 that are not cleared by a course of antifungal treatment, have similar susceptibilities to 60 organisms that are readily cleared by a course of antifungal treatment 12 . Accordingly, it is 61 important to identify measurable parameters that can contribute to disease severity.
Only four classes of antifungals are currently in clinical use, and resistance to azoles, 63 including fluconazole (FLC), the most commonly administered antifungal against Candida 64 species, is an increasing problem. Altered drug uptake/drug efflux and changes in ergosterol 65 biosynthesis (the target for azole drugs) 13 are the major known mechanisms of azole resistance.
Stress responses have been proposed as a third mechanism of antifungal resistance 14 . A 67 broad range of small molecules enhance antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo, with inhibitors of 68 Hsp90, calcineurin and TOR the most prominent among them 15-18 . Combination therapy using 69 antifungals together with such inhibitors has been proposed as a promising strategy to extend 70 the efficacy of current drugs [19][20][21][22][23][24]25,26,27 . In addition, several psychotherapeutic agents such as 71 fluoxetine, fluphenazine or sertraline can enhance FLC activity against fungal species 21,28-30 .
Whether such adjuvants affect therapeutic outcomes remains to be addressed.
Persistent candidemia, defined as the failure to clear a bloodstream infection caused by 74 a susceptible organism 12,31,32 , is associated with increased mortality. In one study, the mortality 75 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Mechanisms underlying persistent candidemia may include variability 77 in the pharmacology of the drug, suboptimal dosing, presence of fungal biofilms on indwelling 78 catheters, and reduced immunity. We posit that some responses to the drug are not captured 79 by measuring the MIC alone and that additional parameters could be used to predict the 80 likelihood that a clinical isolate might respond poorly to antifungal drugs. Furthermore, 81 understanding the mechanisms that underlie these parameters is critical for the development of 82 new therapeutic approaches against persistent Candida infections. 83 MIC measurements have been optimized to minimize or ignore residual fungal 84 growth 9,34,35 , termed 'tolerance' or 'trailing growth', which has been discussed in the literature for 85 over 20 years 36,37 and is detected in 25-60% of clinical isolates 4,10,19,38-44 . This recommendation 86 is based upon studies of acute infections using the mouse model of bloodstream candidiasis 45-87 47 , and the observation that isolates with high trailing growth in mucosal infections respond 88 positively to short term antifungal treatment, despite later recurrence of infection 48 . Trailing 89 growth is sensitive to environmental conditions, including pH, temperature and nutrients 3,49,50 90 and is usually detected in liquid cultures. Definitions of 'tolerance' vary and generally describe 91 survival or growth above inhibitory concentrations 2,10,28,38,51-56 , detected as slow growth within 92 the zone of inhibition using E-strips or disk diffusion assays 57,58 , or in broth microdilution 93 assays 38,39 . Tolerance can be affected by several adjuvant drugs 19-24 , iron levels 19,59 , genes 94 involved in vacuolar protein sorting 38,47 , as well as calcium flux 28,55,59-61 . However, the precise 95 relationship between the outcome of fungal infections and tolerance or trailing growth has not 96 been determined. Because tolerant cells continue to divide in the presence of antifungals, we 97 postulated that they contribute to the persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections.
Here, we measured susceptibility and tolerance in a broad range of clinical isolates 99 spanning the major C. albicans clades 62-64 and asked how these parameters influence fungal 100 infection outcomes.

We 103 found that a range of adjuvant drugs, used in combination with FLC, increased drug cidality by 104 reducing FoG and not MIC and were effective both in vitro and in vivo at inhibiting strains with 105 high (and not low) FoG levels. Finally, highly tolerant isolates were associated with persistent 106 candidemia, suggesting that knowing the tolerance level of an infecting isolate may have 107 important clinical implications and may inform treatment options. 108 109 Results
Tolerance measured as FoG is distinct from drug resistance. We quantified drug 111 responses in C. albicans isolates from different genetic backgrounds and types of infections 112 using diskImageR, a quantitative analysis tool that measures RAD, the radius of the zone of 113 inhibition, an indicator of susceptibility that relates to MIC 69,70 , and FoG, the fraction of growth 114 within the zone of inhibition, relative to the maximum possible growth 65 (Fig. 1a) . A screen of 115 219 clinical isolates (Supplementary Table 1 ) revealed that FoG levels ranged widely from 0.10 116 to 0.85 and did not correlate with RAD levels (Fig. 1b,c) , indicating that FoG and RAD measure 117 independent drug responses. FoG was detected in response to other drugs including fungistatic 118 antifungals (azoles, 5-fluorocytosine) and, to a lesser degree, to fungicidal agents 119
( Supplementary Fig. 3e) . A series of strains derived from SC5314 by passaging were 154 particularly sensitive to media differences, with lower RAD and higher FoG levels on rich 155 medium (YPD) than on casitone medium ( Supplementary Fig. 3f ), emphasizing that assays 156 must be performed under consistent conditions to ensure reproducible results. Importantly, FoG/SMG is independent of cell density. Importantly, these results establish that FoG levels 167 represent the proportion of the population that can form colonies or grow above the MIC. area occupied by light pixels and the change in this area over time are proxies for colony size and growth rate, respectively 74 . Different C. albicans isolates exhibited different initial time of Fig. 2e,f) . Notably, the ∆ToA (ToA on FLC -ToA without FLC) of high FoG isolates was shorter 184 than that of low FoG isolates (Fig. 2f) , and correlated with overall FoG levels (Fig. 2g) . This 185 suggests that high FoG strains overcome the inhibitory pressures of the antifungal more 186 efficiently than low FoG strains. Consistent with this, in liquid assays with drug, highly tolerant 187 isolates also displayed shorter lag times than related isolates with low tolerance levels 188 ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ).
A number of C. albicans growth parameters did not correlate with FoG levels. These 190 included cell viability in the presence of drug (Fig. 2h) , consistent with FLC being fungistatic 191 rather than fungicidal. Unlike tolerant bacteria, which display reduced growth rates and longer 192 colony appearance times 2,75-77 , antifungal tolerance did not correlate with slower growth in three Decreased intracellular drug levels underlie increased tolerance. A recently developed 206 fluorescent azole probe, FLC-Cy5 81 , provides a powerful tool to monitor intracellular drug levels 207 and uptake rates using flow cytometry (Fig. 3a) . The initial rate of FLC-Cy5 uptake per cell 208 varied between strains and showed a weak inverse correlation with FoG levels (R 2 = 0.64, P = 209 0.12, Fig. 3b ). By contrast, steady state FLC-Cy5 levels at 24 h correlated inversely with FoG 210 levels (R 2 = 0.8, P < 0.01, Fig. 3c ). Cells were categorized as having low, mid, and high levels of 
Based on the assumption that the steady state drug levels are influenced by both drug 215 efflux and uptake, we measured efflux of rhodamine-6-G (R6G), a dye removed primarily via the 216 ABC class of transporters 82 . In general, the rate of R6G efflux was higher in the presence, than 217 in the absence, of FLC, with SC5314 as the notable exception ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.   218   6a ). Yet, efflux rates did not correlate with FoG under any of the conditions tested 219 ( Supplementary Fig. 6b , R 2 < 0.2). Thus, the determinants of steady state intracellular FLC 220 levels are complex, and include uptake and efflux rates as well as other factors (Fig. 3g ).
fluoxetine, a serotonin inhibitor 21 ; and fluphenazine, an antipsychotic drug that stimulates ABC transporter expression and indirectly inhibits calcineurin via calmodulin 23,28,95 . FLC + adjuvant 233 cleared tolerance for all 7 clinical isolates tested (Fig. 4a,b) , as well as for a longitudinal series 234 from a single HIV patient 96,97 that had acquired resistance over time, and for a set of persistent 235 and non-persistent clinical isolates ( Supplementary Fig. 7a-d) . Importantly, most adjuvants had 236 little or no effect on RAD/MIC levels (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 7a- 
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that tolerance is an intrinsic property distinct 302 from drug susceptibility, and that tolerance levels correlate with infections that resist azole 303 treatment in the clinic.
