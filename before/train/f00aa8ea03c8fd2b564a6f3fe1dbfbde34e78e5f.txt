The rapid and escalating spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 6 poses an immediate public health emergency. The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 7 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome 8
intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses 9 by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic and 10 prophylactic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified 11
with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found 12 across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they 13 are predicted to enhance folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When 14 single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The 15 mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and 16
peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented 17 challenge.
In December, 2019, a novel zoonotic betacoronavirus closely related to bat coronaviruses 19 spilled over to humans at the Huanan Seafood Market in the Chinese city of Wuhan (1, 2) . 20
The virus, called SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with the severe acute respiratory 21 syndrome (SARS) coronavirus responsible for a smaller outbreak nearly two decades prior 22
(3, 4), has since spread human-to-human rapidly across the world, precipitating 23 extraordinary containment measures from governments (5). Stock markets have fallen, 24 travel restrictions have been imposed, public gatherings canceled, and large numbers of 25 people are self-isolating. These events are unlike any experienced in generations. 26 Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) range from mild to dry cough, fever, 27 pneumonia and death, and SARS-CoV-2 is devastating among the elderly and other 28 vulnerable groups (6, 7). 29
The S spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on 30 host cells (2, 8-13). S is a trimeric class I viral fusion protein that is proteolytically 31 processed into S1 and S2 subunits that remain noncovalently associated in a prefusion 32 state (8, 11, 14) . Upon engagement of ACE2 by a receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (15), 33 conformational rearrangements occur that cause S1 shedding, cleavage of S2 by host 34 proteases, and exposure of a fusion peptide adjacent to the S2' proteolysis site (14, (16) (17) (18) . 35 Favorable folding of S to a post-fusion conformation is coupled to host cell/virus 36 membrane fusion and cytosolic release of viral RNA. Atomic contacts with the RBD are 37
restricted to the protease domain of ACE2 (19, 20) , and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in which the 38 neck and transmembrane domains are removed is sufficient for binding S and neutralizing 39
infection (12, (21) (22) (23) (24) . In principle, the virus has limited potential to escape sACE2-40 mediated neutralization without simultaneously decreasing affinity for native ACE2 41 receptors, thereby attenuating virulence. Furthermore, fusion of sACE2 to the Fc region of  42  human immunoglobulin can provide an avidity boost while recruiting immune effector  43  functions and increasing serum stability, an especially desirable quality if intended for  44 prophylaxis (23, 25), and sACE2 has proven safe in healthy human subjects (26) typically yield no more than one coding variant per cell, providing a tight link between 62 genotype and phenotype (32, 33). Cells were then incubated with a subsaturating dilution 63 of medium containing the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 fused C-terminally to superfolder GFP 64 (sfGFP: (34)) ( Fig. 1A) . Levels of bound RBD-sfGFP correlate with surface expression levels 65 of myc-tagged ACE2 measured by dual color flow cytometry. Compared to cells expressing 66 wild type ACE2 (Fig. 1C ), many variants in the ACE2 library fail to bind RBD, while there 67 appeared to be a smaller number of ACE2 variants with higher binding signals (Fig. 1D ). 68
Cells expressing ACE2 variants with high or low binding to RBD were collected by 69 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), referred to as "nCoV-S-High" and "nCoV-S-Low" 70 sorted populations, respectively. During FACS, fluorescence signal for bound RBD-sfGFP 71 continuously declined, requiring the collection gates to be regularly updated to 'chase' the 72 relevant populations. This is consistent with RBD dissociating over hours during the 73 experiment. Reported affinities of RBD for ACE2 range from 1 to 15 nM (8, 10). 74 .

were compared to the naive plasmid library to calculate the enrichment or depletion of all 101 2,340 coding mutations in the library (Fig. 2 ). This approach of tracking an in vitro 102 selection or evolution by deep sequencing is known as deep mutagenesis (35). Enrichment 103 ratios ( Fig. 3A and 3B) and residue conservation scores ( Fig. 3D and 3E) closely agree 104 between two independent sort experiments, giving confidence in the data. For the most 105 part, enrichment ratios ( Fig. 3C ) and conservation scores (Fig. 3F ) in the nCoV-S-High sorts 106
are anticorrelated with the nCoV-S-Low sorts, with the exception of nonsense mutations 107 which were appropriately depleted from both gates. This indicates that most, but not all, 108 nonsynonymous mutations in ACE2 did not eliminate surface expression. The library is 109 biased towards solvent-exposed residues and has few substitutions of buried hydrophobics 110 that might have bigger effects on plasma membrane trafficking (33). 111 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994236 doi: bioRxiv preprint both nCoV-S-Low sorts (F). Conservation scores are calculated from the mean of the log 2 124 enrichment ratios for all amino acid substitutions at each residue position.
Mapping the experimental conservation scores from the nCoV-S-High sorts to the structure 126 of RBD-bound ACE2 (19) shows that residues buried in the interface tend to be conserved, 127
whereas residues at the interface periphery or in the substrate-binding cleft are 128 mutationally tolerant (Fig. 4A) . The region of ACE2 surrounding the C-terminal end of the 129 ACE2 α1 helix and β3-β4 strands has a weak tolerance of polar residues, while amino acids 130 at the N-terminal end of α1 and the C-terminal end of α2 prefer hydrophobics (Fig. 4B) , 131 likely in part to preserve hydrophobic packing between α1-α2. These discrete patches 132 contact the globular RBD fold and a long protruding loop of the RBD, respectively. 133
Two ACE2 residues, N90 and T92 that together form a consensus N-glycosylation motif, are 134 notable hot spots for enriched mutations (Fig. 2 and 4A) . Indeed, all substitutions of N90 135 and T92, with the exception of T92S which maintains the N-glycan, are highly favorable for 136 RBD binding, and the N90-glycan is thus predicted to partially hinder S/ACE2 interaction. 137 characterized interface enhance RBD binding, and will be useful for engineering highly 157 specific and tight binders of SARS-CoV-2 S. The molecular basis for how some of these 158 mutations enhance RBD binding can be rationalized from the RBD-bound cryo-EM 159 structure (Fig. 4C ): hydrophobic substitutions of ACE2-T27 increase hydrophobic packing 160 with aromatic residues of S, ACE2-D30E extends an acidic side chain to reach S-K417, and 161 aromatic substitutions of ACE2-K31 contribute to an interfacial cluster of aromatics. 162
However, engineered ACE2 receptors with mutations at the interface may present binding 163 epitopes that are sufficiently different from native ACE2 that virus escape mutants can 164 emerge, or they may be strain specific and lack breadth to bind S in future coronavirus 165 outbreaks. 166
Instead, attention was drawn to mutations in the second shell and farther from the 167 interface that do not directly contact S but instead have putative structural roles. For 168 example, proline substitutions were enriched at five library positions (S19, L91, T92, T324 169 and Q325) where they might entropically stabilize the first turns of helices. Proline was 170 also enriched at H34, where it may enforce the central bulge in α1. Multiple mutations 171
were also enriched at buried positions where they will change local packing (e.g. A25V, 172 L29F, W69V, F72Y and L351F). The selection of ACE2 variants for high binding signal 173 therefore not only reports on affinity, but also on presentation at the membrane of folded 174 structure recognized by SARS-CoV-2 S. The presence of enriched structural mutations in 175 the sequence landscape is especially notable considering the ACE2 library was biased 176 towards solvent-exposed positions. 177 Thirty single substitutions highly enriched in the nCoV-S-High sort were validated by 178 targeted mutagenesis (Fig. 5) . Binding of RBD-sfGFP to full length ACE2 mutants increased 179 compared to wild type, yet improvements were small and were most apparent on cells 180 expressing low ACE2 levels (Fig. 5A) . To rapidly assess mutations in a format more 181 relevant to therapeutic development, the soluble ACE2 protease domain was fused to 182 sfGFP. Expression levels of sACE2-sfGFP were qualitatively evaluated by fluorescence of 183 the transfected cultures (Fig. 6A) , and binding of sACE2-sfGFP to full length S expressed at 184 .

A single substitution 185 (T92Q) that eliminates the N90 glycan gave a small increase in binding signal (Fig. 6B ). 186
Focusing on the most highly enriched substitutions in the selection for S binding that were 187 also spatially segregated to minimize negative epistasis (36), combinations of mutations in 188 sACE2 gave large increases in S binding (Table 1 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994236 doi: bioRxiv preprint 208 were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 minutes and medium was stored at -20 °C. 239
After thawing and immediately prior to use, remaining cell debris and precipitates were 240 removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 minutes. Soluble ACE2-sfGFP protein was 241 produced by the same protocol with the following modifications: the products for annealing to Illumina sequencing primers,  264 unique barcoding, and for binding the flow cell.

NovaSeq 6000 using a 2×250 nt paired end protocol. Data were analyzed using Enrich (38), 266
and commands are provided in the GEO deposit. Briefly, the frequencies of ACE2 variants in 267 the transcripts of the sorted populations were compared to their frequencies in the naive 268 plasmid library to calculate an enrichment ratio. 269 Biologics, Inc. 291
