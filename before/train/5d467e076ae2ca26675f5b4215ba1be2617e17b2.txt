However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ.
Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough .

Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and are broadly distributed in humans and other vertebrates, eventually causing damage in digestive, respiratory and even multiple systems. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1] . Sequencing analysis of throat swabs samples and electron microscope observations indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) [2] . Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to have obvious human-to-human characteristics [3, 4] . As of March 20, 2020, more than two hundred thousand confirmed cases have been identified globally, for a total of 8778 deaths [5] .
As the epidemic is spreading to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health [6] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective drugs against COVID-19.
The recent publication of results showing the activity of chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [7] , some experts and researchers also have been recommended the efficacy of this antimalarial drug in patients with COVID-19 [8, 9] . For this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been working to investigate the use of CQ in COVID-19 [10] . As a derivative of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has similar therapeutic effects and fewer adverse effects. Based on its .

However, the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 remains unknown.
Interestingly, through a follow-up survey, we found that none of our 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms. In addition, among the 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, none were receiving HCQ treatment before admission. All predicting the use of HCQ in SARS-CoV-2
infections. As one of the clinical research registration units in China, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of HCQ in patients with COVID-19 in this study.
The clinical research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee in Renmin Pulmonary recovery is defined as three levels: exacerbated, unchanged, and improved, moderately improved when less than 50 % of pneumonia were absorbed, and more than 50 % means significantly improved.
Data were described as the mean (standard deviation, SD), n (%), the t-test or χ ² test was used to compare the differences between the two groups. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism, version 6.0.
62 patients were identified as having COVID-19 and enrolled in this study, none quit ( Figure 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , For all patients, the age was 44.7 (15.3) years old, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and .

There was no significant difference in the age and sex distribution between the two groups of patients, but there are significant differences in TTCR between the two groups.

Experts and guides for COVID-19 in China have also recommended chloroquine phosphate superior to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [8, 9] . To assess the safety and effects of CQ in patients with COVID-19, we registered this trial in ChiCTR and chose HCQ (the sulfate and phosphate salts of CQ) as the intervention agent. The data in this study revealed that after 5 days of HCQ treatment, the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were significantly relieved, manifesting as shorten in the recovery time for cough and fever. At the same time, a larger proportion of patients with pulmonary inflammatory has been partially absorbed in the HCQ treatment group, indicating the immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of HCQ in non-malarial diseases [17] . At present, the multiple actions of HCQ such as regulation in pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g.
Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1 (IL-6)], antioxidant activities, also promote it widely performed in rheumatic diseases such as SLE [11, 17] . According to current research, a higher pro-inflammatory cytokine storm existed in COVID-19 patients with a severe or critical illness, eventually affected the prognosis [18] . For this, IL-6 antibody blocker, transfusion of convalescent plasma, and other therapies have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm [19, 20] . Therefore, with antiviral and autoimmune regulation effects, HCQ should be a protector in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, the reduced risk of progression to severe illness in patients with HCQ treatment also explained the intervention effect of HCQ on the pathological process of the COVID-19.
Although HCQ has proven to be effective, with advantages of inexpensive and easily accessible, its potential detrimental effects in viral diseases must also be taken seriously. Retinopathy is one of the major adverse reactions of long-term therapy with HCQ [21] . Besides, patients with rheumatoid diseases treated with HCQ occasionally experience arrhythmias [22] . Other rare adverse reactions caused by HCQ include gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, liver dysfunction, itching, headache, dizziness, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy [13] . Fortunately, deciding on individual treatment plans scientifically, monitoring adverse reactions timely, to avoid overdose, short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.
Despite our small number of cases, the potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 has been partially confirmed. Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management. However, Large-scale clinical and basic .
