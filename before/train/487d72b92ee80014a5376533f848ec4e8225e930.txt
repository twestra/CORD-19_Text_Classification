A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, is a key 5 component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of 2019-nCoV full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 2.9-Å. Additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain featured in coronaviral RdRp, nsp12 10 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N-terminal. Key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed. A comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided. This structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.
One Sentence Summary: Structure of 2019-nCov RNA polymerase. infections and 4291 fatalities have been confirmed globally. 2019-nCoV is reported to be a new member of the betacoronavirus genus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and to several bat coronaviruses (4). Compared to SARS-CoV and 5 MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to exhibit faster human-to-human transmission, thus leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)(1, 3).
CoVs employ a multi-subunit replication/transcription machinery, being assembled by a set of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins (5) to facilitate virus replication and transcription. A key component, the RNA-10 dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and thus plays a central role in the replication and transcription cycle of 2019-nCoV, possibly with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as co-factors (5, 6). Therefore, nsp12 is a primary target for the nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors, e.g. remdesivir which shows potential to treat 2019-nCoV infections (7, 8). To inform drug design we have determined the structure of nsp12, in complex with its cofactors nsp7 15 and nsp8 by cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) using two different protocols, one in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1) and the other in the presence of DTT (Dataset-2).
The bacterially expressed full-length 2019-nCoV nsp12 (residues S1-Q932) was incubated with nsp7 (residues S1-Q83) and nsp8 (residues A1-Q198), and the complex was then purified (fig. S1). Cryo-EM grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed 20 excellent particle density with good dispersity. After collecting and processing 7,994 micrograph movies, we obtained a 2.9-Å resolution 3D reconstruction of one nsp12 monomer in complex with one nsp7-nsp8 pair and one nsp8. Like that observed in SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 (6), we observed classes corresponding to an nsp12 monomer in complex one nsp8, as well as individual nsp12s, but these do not give atomic resolution reconstructions ( fig. S2 ). However, the nsp12-25 nsp7-nsp8 complex provides all the structural information for complete and comprehensive analysis.
The structure of the 2019-nCoV nsp12 contains a "right hand" polymerase domain (residues S367-F920), and a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension domain (residues D60-R249) adopting a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN)(9) architecture, being connected by 30 an interface domain (residues A250-F369) (Figs. 1, A and B). An additional N-terminal β-hairpin (V31-K50) was built with the guidance of an unambiguous cryo-EM map (fig. S3A), inserting into the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain (Fig. 2) . The nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 pair (6, 10). The orientation of the N-terminal helix of another individual nsp8 bound to nsp12 is shifted 35 compared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair ( fig. S4 ). The polypeptides of nsp12 can be traced in the map, except for S1-V30, T51-S68, H75, K103-V111, D336, T896-S904, F921-Q932, which cannot be observed.
Although the overall architecture of 2019-nCoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex is generally similar to that of SARS-CoV with an r.m.s.d value of 0.82 for 1,078 Cɑ atoms there are key features that 40 distinguish them. First, the cryo-EM map allows us to build the structure of 2019-nCoV nsp12 covering almost all residues, presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of coronaviral RdRp. In SARS-CoV nsp12, there are seven helices with a three-stranded β-sheet at the end that make up the NiRAN domain (6) ( Fig. 2A) . Residues Y69-R118 constitute an additional structural block with three anti-parallel β-strands and one helix. Residues N215-D218 45 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As a result, these four strands form a compact semi βbarrel architecture. Therefore, we identify residues Y69-R249 as the complete coronaviral NiRAN domain. Second, the cryo-EM map helps us to identify a unique N-terminal β-hairpin (Figs. 1A and 2A). This β-hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm 5 subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure ( Fig. 2B and fig. S5 ). Another point to note is that, we have observed C301-C306 and C487-C645 form disulfide bonds in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1). However, in the presence of DTT (Dataset-2), chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in SARS-CoV ( fig. S3B) . We reasoned the different purification buffer has led to this variation.
The polymerase domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family (11) and is composed of three subdomains, including a fingers subdomain (residues S397-A581 and K621-G679), a palm subdomain (residues T582-P620 and T680-Q815), and a thumb subdomain (residues H816-E920) (Fig. 1) . The catalytic cations, which are usually observed in viral polymerase structure for RNA synthesis (12, 13) are not observed, possibly because manganese 15 was not included in the buffer for purification or in the cryo-EM sampling buffer. The active site chamber of 2019-nCoV RdRp domain is formed by the conserved polymerase motifs A-G in the palm domain and configured like other RNA polymerases (Figs. 1A and 3A; fig. S6). Motif A covers residues 611-TPHLMGWDYPKCDRAM-626 with a potential divalentcation-binding residue D618, which is conserved in HCV ns5b (residue D220) and poliovirus (PV) 20 3D pol (residue D233) (12, 13) (Figs. 3, B and C). Motif B is in the region 680-TSSGDATTAYANSVFNICQAVTANVNALLST-710. Motif C (residues 753-FSMMILSDDAVVCFN-767) contains the catalytic residues (759-SDD-761) in the turn between the two β-strands. These catalytic residues are also conserved in viral RdRp, e.g. 317-GDD-319 in HCV ns5b and 327-GDD-329 PV 3D pol with the first residue being a glycine residue as an 25 alternative. Motif D is assigned as 775-LVASIKNFKSVLYYQNNVFMSE-796. Motif E (810-HEFCSQHTMLV-820) forms the tight loop. Motif F (912-KKNQHGGLRE-921) forms an ordered loop (β-loop) connecting two anti-parallel β-strands. Motif G is in 500-KSAGFPFNKWGKARLYYDS-518.
In this structure, the four positively charged solvent-accessible paths converge into a central cavity 30 where the RdRp motifs mediate template-directed RNA synthesis (Fig. 3D ). The configurations of the template/primer entry paths, the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and the nascent strand exit path are similar to those described for HCV and PV polymerase (14) (Figs. 3, B and C). The NTP entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues, including K545, R553 and R555 in motif F. The RNA template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs A and 35 C through a groove clamped by motif F and G. Motif E and the thumb subdomain support the primer strand. The product-template hybrid exits the active site through the RNA exit tunnel at the front side of the polymerase.
Remdesivir, the single Sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl L-alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug (15) ( fig. S7 ), has been reported to inhibit 2019-nCoV proliferation and have potential to treat patients 40 in the clinic (7, 8). The efficacy of chain-terminating nucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing RNA strand. Because of the structural conservation on the polymerase catalytic chamber between 2019-nCoV and HCV ns5b polymerase, as well as the likely similar mechanisms of action of remdesivir and sofosbuvir (12, 16) (2'-F-2'-C-methyluridine monophosphate prodrug which targets HCV 45 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint 5 ns5b and has been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection) ( fig. S7) , a model of 2019-nCoV nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed (Fig. 4) . In 2019-nCoV nsp12, the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with T680 and N691 in motif B (Figs. 4, A and B ). In addition, D623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3' hydroxyl through hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the hydrophobic side chain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with 5 and stabilize the +1 template RNA uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir (ppp-remdesivir). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or its complex with pp-sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen bonding network between S282 and D225 (Figs. 4, C and D), which is necessary to stabilize the incoming natural nucleotide (12). However, key contacts formed by S282 with the incoming 10 nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an S→T resistance mutation that is already observed in the clinic (17). In the structure of apo 2019-nCoV nsp12, the orientation of S682 and D623, which are strictly conserved with S282 and D225 in HCV ns5b, is similar to that observed in the HCV ns5b-pp-sofosbuvir complex, indicating a different recognition mechanism with that inhibitor. Nevertheless, the close distance of S682 with the incoming ppp-remdesivir and 15 the environment surrounding the inhibitor alters the appearance of a drug-resistant mutation associated with remdesivir treatments.
The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV has emphasized the need for the development of new coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. The viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target for new therapeutics, especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of compounds such 20 as remdesivir. This target, in addition to other promising drug targets such as the main protease, whose structure was recently determined by our group (18) in complex with an inhibitor (19, 20) will support the development of a cocktail of anti-coronavirus treatments that potentially can be used for the discovery of broad-spectrum antivirals. 25

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, is a key 5 component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir.

This structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged (1) (2) (3) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, 11800 infections and 4291 fatalities have been confirmed globally. 2019-nCoV is reported to be a new member of the betacoronavirus genus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and to several bat coronaviruses (4).

Cryo-EM grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed 20 excellent particle density with good dispersity. After collecting and processing 7,994 micrograph movies, we obtained a 2.9-Å resolution 3D reconstruction of one nsp12 monomer in complex with one nsp7-nsp8 pair and one nsp8.

S2 ). However, the nsp12-25 nsp7-nsp8 complex provides all the structural information for complete and comprehensive analysis.

S3A ), inserting into the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain (Fig. 2) . The nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 pair (6, 10). The orientation of the N-terminal helix of another individual nsp8 bound to nsp12 is shifted 35 compared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair ( fig. S4 ). The polypeptides of nsp12 can be traced in the map, except for S1-V30, T51-S68, H75, K103-V111, D336, T896-S904, F921-Q932, which cannot be observed.

The 2019-nCoV nsp12 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was cloned into a modified pET-22a 5 vector, with the C-terminus possessing a 10 × His-tag. The plasmids were transformed into E. coil BL21 (DE3), and the transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin. After the OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16 °C and supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl, 10 10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed through centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and elution with lysis buffer and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4 mg ml/L and stored at 4 °C. The full-length 2019-nCoV nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coil BL21 (DE3) cells as a notagged protein and a 6 × His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag 20 cleavage by ULP protease. The eluate was further purified by Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection 25 An aliquot of 3 μL of the sample at 0.7 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto a H2/O2 glow-discharged, 300-mesh Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 30 USA) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at EFTEM with a 165000× magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.82 Å/pixel. The exposure time was set to 5 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM (21). For Dataset-1, a total of 7,994 images were collected with a defocus range from 1.0 μm to 1.8 μm. For Dataset-2 (under reducing conditions), a total of 35 8494 images were collected with a defocus range from 1.1 μm to 2.0 μm. Statistics for data collection and refinement are in Table S1 .
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2 40 software (22) and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by cryoSPARC patch CTF estimation. For Dataset-1, a total of 2,334,248 particles were auto-picked using blob picker and extracted with a box size of 300 pixels in cryoSPARC (20). The following 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 918,133 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification. 100,000 particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in five classes, and then these five classes were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement with all selected particles, with 110,176 particles converged into one class. Next, this particle set was used to perform homogeneous refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.1 Å. After local refinement, the final resolution reached 2.9 Å. For Dataset-2, the image processing was conducted using a similar pipeline. 753,481 particles were auto-picked initially, and 145,388 5 particles were selected after final heterogeneous refinement. The resolution reached 2.99 Å after non-uniform refinement and 2.95 Å after local refinement with a mask.
Model building and refinement To solve the structure of the 2019-nCoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex, the structure of the 10 SARS-CoV nsp12 (24) and nsp7-8 (25) were individually placed and rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera (26). After the corresponding amino acids were replaced with those from 2019-nCoV, the model was manually built in Coot (27) with the guidance of the cryo-EM map, and in combination with real space refinement with Phenix (28).
