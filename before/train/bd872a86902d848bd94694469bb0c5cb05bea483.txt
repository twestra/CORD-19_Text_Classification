Human infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is driven by 28 recurring dromedary-to-human spill-over events, leading decision-makers to consider dromedary 29 vaccination. Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, 30 but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed 31 to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published 32 literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary 33 populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative 34 syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries 35 supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian 36 Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection 37 measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further 38 investigation -particularly of dromedary movement -and inform vaccination strategy design. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 .

The dromedary population is highly heterogeneous and 68 spans a wide geographic area stretching from West Africa through to the Middle East and parts of 69 Asia. Knowing when and where dromedaries would need to be targeted, and the likely impact of 70 vaccination, is necessary before further consideration of dromedary vaccination in the wider 71 socioeconomic and cultural context. 72 Here, we systematically reviewed published studies that measured MERS-CoV antibody 73 seroprevalence in dromedaries and/or prevalence of viral RNA in dromedaries. Assuming assay 74 specificity and long-term presence of antibodies after infection, seroprevalence can be used to 75 estimate what proportion of a dromedary population has ever been infected with MERS-CoV. Broken 76 down by age class, this can tell us when most animals encounter the infection for the first time. 77 Additionally, although whole-virus isolation and culture is necessary to confirm whether the shedding .

Neutralising antibody tests are more specific 103 and are the WHO (World Health Organisation) recommended method for confirming MERS-CoV 104 seropositivity (9).
Since the first human case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection 53 was detected in 2012 (1), a substantial evidence base has built up showing dromedary camels to be the 54 zoonotic source of this virus (2) . MERS-CoV circulates extensively in dromedary populations causing 55 no impactful disease. Human infection, however, is associated with a measured case fatality ratio of 56 around 35% (3). Following spillover events, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is 57 relatively inefficient and limited to close, unprotected contact environments such as hospitals (4, 5) .
Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences isolated from dromedaries and humans indicates that 59 hundreds of camel-to-human spillover events are likely to have occurred since 2012 (6). Taken 60 together, recurring dromedary-to-human transmission is driving ongoing human infection.
The key role of dromedaries in human MERS-CoV infection has led decision-makers to consider 62 dromedary vaccination as part of MERS-CoV prevention interventions (2) . Dromedary-targeted 63 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing promising results and include an 64 orthopox-virus based vaccine capable of greatly reducing viral shedding in dromedary challenge 78 is infectious, detection of viral RNA through RT-PCR can be used as a proxy for the prevalence and 79 distribution of infectious dromedaries (8-10).
By conducting a qualitative synthesis of the study findings, considering reported heterogeneities, and 81 summarising the results of longitudinal studies of infection and immunity, we aim to assess the extent 82 of current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology in dromedaries, implications for control, and 83 gaps to be addressed going forward. We note that a similar systematic review of the literature up until
May 2018 was unknowingly carried out in parallel to our own (11), with no discussion between the 85 two groups.

In Kenya all 182 three studies that presented sub-nationally disaggregated results showed seroprevalence to 183 vary greatly by province. Tunisia, Morocco and Mali also showed considerable regional 184 seroprevalence variation. Less regional variation in seroprevalence was observed within Several studies found imported animals to have significantly higher seroprevalence than their 188 locally bred counterparts (22, 25, 29, 30) . Dromedaries sampled at markets, abattoirs and 189 quarantine sites had higher seroprevalence than those in farms, villages and research facilities 190 (22, 29, 30, 39) . In some cases, dromedary origin varied with the type of site sampled 191 suggesting confounding.
In a study conducted across Burkina Faso, Morocco and Ethiopia, dromedaries used for milk 193 and meat had higher seroprevalence than those used for transport (23). In most of the studies 194 that stratified by sex, little difference was seen, but in Kenya females had statistically 195 significantly higher seroprevalence than males (93% vs. 81% in one study (42), and 74% vs. (44)) whereas males had significantly higher seroprevalence in Egypt and in 197 KSA (72% and 84% in males vs. 66% in females) (29, 70).

All available 260 studies followed animals that were found to be MERS-CoV RNA positive at the first instance 261 of sampling and the duration of shedding prior to sampling is unknown. Further to this, 262 intermittent RNA shedding, and evidence of potential rapid reinfection/coinfection has been 263 observed (65, 67).
Three studies have found dromedaries to be shedding MERS-CoV RNA despite having high 266 antibody titres months or weeks prior to detectable infection. Both older animals whose 267 antibodies reflect past exposure (29, 76, 79) , and young calves whose high antibody titres 268 were maternally-acquired immediately post-partum, became infected (79).
One study directly observed recurring infection amongst a herd of dromedaries in Egypt.

The age-312 distribution of reported infections synthesised here, suggests that contact with juveniles may 313 pose greater risks of human transmission than adults, making them potential targets for 314 vaccination.
