Lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm are typical abnormalities observed in highly 83 pathogenic coronavirus infections (such as SARS and MERS), 3 believed to be associated with disease 84 severity. 4-6 Several clinical studies revealed that cytokine storms are important mechanisms underlying 85 disease exacerbation and death of COVID-19 patients. 4-6 Particularly, IL-6 levels in severely ill patients 86 were significantly higher than in mild cases. 7 IL-6 is one of the core cytokines that are consistently 87 .

Substantial studies have reported that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has various 93 non-anticoagulant properties 12 that play an anti-inflammatory role by reducing the release of IL-6. 13-15 94 However, the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH in COVID-19 are currently unknown. By analyzing 95 the relieving effect of LMWH in patients with COVID-19 our retrospective cohort study demonstrates, 96 for the first time, the significant benifiical effect of LMWH in controlling ctytokine storm. This 97 approach is believed to delay disease progression in COVID-19 patients, strongly encuraging a 98 well-controlled clinical practice (Fig. 1 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Differences of p < 0·05 were considered statistically significant.
General characteristics of patients with COVID-19 135 As shown in Table 2 , the LMWH group consisted of 13 males and eight females aged between 42 and 136 91 years (median age = 69·0 years), and the Control group consisted of 14 males and seven females 137 aged between 40 and 84 years (median age = 69·0 years). There were no significant differences in 138 comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, between the two 139 groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in coronavirus pneumonia onset symptoms, 140 including fever (body temperature ≥ 37·3°C), cough, sputum, chest distress or asthma, myalgia, fatigue, 141 anorexia, diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. Similarly, there was no significant difference in antiviral 142 treatment between the two groups. These results indicate that the general characteristics of the two 143 groups of patients were consistent and comparable.

As shown in Fig. 3J , the levels of fibrinogen 173 degradation products (FDP) in the LMWH group were significantly higher compared to those in the 174 Control group before treatment (14·35±14·6, 4·05±3·9, p=0·002). There was no significant difference 175 in FDP levels between the LMWH and Control groups after LMWH treatment (2·64±1·16, 3·59±4·00, 176 p=0·959). In the LMWH group, FDP levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment 177 (14·35±14·6, 2·64±1·16, p=0·001). The changes in FDP levels in patients of the LMWH group before 178 and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the Control group (-9·05±13·14, 179 -1·78±3·15, p=0·035).

Therefore, the present study does 215 not consider this parameter as an evaluation index for disease progression. The average values of 216 D-dimer and FDP before treatment was higher in the LMWH group than in the control group (3·75, 217 1·23, p< 0·01; 14·35, 4·05, p<0·01), therefore LMWH was applied. Because this trial is a retrospective 218 analysis, we did not intervene in the type of treatment given to the patients, inferring that the purpose 219 of medication in the LMWH group was to improve hypercoagulability. Because D-dimer and FDP are 220 not considered as factors that designate patient's disease progression, their levels had no effect on 221 subsequent analysis of the results. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Notably, LYM% was higher in the LMWH group compared 260 to the Control group (p < 0·001), consistent with the results of Derhaschnig et al. 39 This suggests that 261 LMWH can increase LYM% in patients with COVID-19 and thereby improve their condition.
Furthermore, it was reported that proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-6, can induce 263 lymphopenia. 6 Hence, the decrease in IL-6 ( Fig. 4B)

Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH improves hypercoagulability, inhibits IL-6 435 release, and attenuates IL-6 biological activity. It has potential antiviral effects and helps delay or block 436 inflammatory cytokine storms. LMWH can increases the LYM% in the patients.
