The glycoprotein spike (S) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a determinant for viral invasion and host immune response. Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosite occupancy by different glycoforms exhibited remarkable heterogeneity in human cell-expressed protein subunits, including up to 157 N-glycans, mainly of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.
low-frequency glycosylation may occur, because our integrated methods, including glycopeptide enrichment and deglycosylation, failed to improve the spectra. Apart from the canonical N-glycosylation sequons, three non-canonical motifs of N-glycosites (N164, N334, and N536) involving N-X-C sequons were not glycosylated. Before enrichment, an average of 15 N-glycosites from trypsin-digested peptides and 13 N-glycosites from Glu-C-digested peptides were assigned. In contrast, hydrophilic enrichment resulted in a significant increase of these glycosites to 18 and 16, respectively (Table S1 ). To further assess the necessity for enrichment, we compared the representative spectra of one intact N-glycopeptide (N149) before and after enrichment. Without interference from the non-glycosylated peptides, the intact N-glycopeptide had more fragmented ions assigned to N-glycosites after enrichment ( Fig. S3 ). Complementary digestion with trypsin and Glu-C promoted the confident identification of four N-glycosites (N603, N616, N709 and N717) on two intact N-glycopeptides (Table S1 and Fig. S1C ). The introduction of Glu-C digestion resulted in the production of two short intact N-glycopeptides containing 23 and 36 amino acids, respectively. These peptides are more suitable for achieving better ionization and fragmentation than the long peptide of 48 and 57 amino acids obtained from trypsin digestion (Fig. S4 ). Deglycopeptides are suitable for verifying glycosylation sites (Fig. S5) . Unexpectedly, deglycopeptide peptides led to the loss of a few glycosites, presumably because of peptide loss during deglycosylation procedures. However, almost all glycosites were confidently confirmed using trypsin and Glu-C dual digestion (Table S1 ).
For the recombinant protein S1 subunit expressed in human cells, all 13 N-glycosites were assigned unambiguously (Table S2 ). Finally, we profiled all 22 potential N-glycosites of S protein (Table S3 and S4). These sites were preferentially . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

To visualize the N-glycosylation on the protein structure, all of the experimentally determined N-glycosites were hand-marked on the surface of the trimeric S protein following refinement of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 S protein Cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6VSB) ( Based on these findings, we further analyzed the conservation of glycosites among 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. After the removal of redundant sequences of the S protein at the amino acid residue level, we refined 145 S protein variants. A very low frequency of alterations in 38 residue sites was found, uniformly spanning the full length of the S protein among all S variants, except for the substitution G614D, which was identified at a relatively high frequency in 47 variants (Table S5) . However, nearly all of the 22 N-glycosylated sequons were conserved in the S protein, except for the loss of the N717 glycosite due to the T719A substitution in only one S variant.
Following further comparison with the closely related SARS-CoV S protein (5, 21) , 18 of the 22 N-glycosites were identified as conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating the importance of glycosylation of the virus. Four newly arisen N-glycosites (N17, N74, N149, and N657) are located in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S1 subunit away from the RBD. Moreover, four previously confirmed N-glycosites (N29, N73, N109, and N357) in the SARS-CoV S protein were missing in SARS-CoV-2 S, one of which (N357) lies in the RBD (Fig. S6 ). Additionally, two N-glycosites (N1158 and N1173) identified in SARS-CoV-2 S in this study were not detected in SARS-CoV S (N1140 and N1155) in previous studies (5, 21) . Our results suggest that the preferential change of the glycosylation landscape of the S1 subunit . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Intact N-glycopeptide analysis can provide N-glycoproteomic information, including the composition and number of N-glycans decorating a specific N-glycopeptide or N-glycosite. The potential N-glycopeptides in the S protein sequence are shown in Fig.   S1 . A comparison of the intact N-glycopeptides' spectra to the total spectra showed that the average enrichment efficiency of the Zic-HILIC materials reached up to 97%.
Ultimately, hundreds of non-redundant intact N-glycopeptides were identified from the recombinant S ectodomain (Table S3 ) and S1 subunit (Table S4) . Representative and high-quality spectra of intact N-glycopeptides are shown in Fig. S7 . Following glycopeptide enrichment, the number of intact N-glycopeptides and N-glycans significantly increased (P<0.05) ( Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B ).
Regarding the N-glycan composition, S protein expressed in insect cells had smaller and fewer complex N-glycans attached to intact N-glycopeptides than S1 subunit produced in human cells. Both recombinant products contained the common N-acetylglucosamine (HexNAc) as a canonical N-glycan characteristic ( Fig. 3C and   3D ). S protein expressed in insect cells were decorated with 38 N-glycans, with the majority preferentially containing oligomannose (Hex) and fucose (Fuc) (Fig. 3C and Table S3 ). By contrast, the S1 subunit expressed in human cells were attached to up to 157 N-glycans, mainly containing extra N-acetylglucosamine (HexNAc) and galactose (Hex), variably terminating with sialic acid (NeuAc) (Fig. 3D and Table S4 ).
Returning to the glycosite level, most of the N-glycosites in the S protein were . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Almost all N-glycosites contained no more than 10% of complex N-glycans (Fig. 3E ).
For the S1 subunit expressed in human cells, the occupancy of N-glycans on each N-glycosite was quite nonuniform. Surprisingly, six N-glycosites (N122, N165, N282, N331, N343, and N657) were decorated with markedly heterogeneous N-glycans of up to 139 types. The average occupancies of all glycosites presented as an overwhelming proportion (~75%) of complex N-glycans and a small proportion of hybrid (~13%) or high-mannose (~12%) N-glycans (Fig. 3F ). The glycan occupancy on two N-glycosites (N331 and N343) of RBD were identified ( Fig. 3E and 3F ). The high occupancy of RBD glycosites by various N-glycan compositions implies that N-glycosylation might be associated with the recognition of RBD to ACE2 receptor, since the interaction between RBD and ACE2 mainly depends on polar residue interactions(11). Our results suggest that S proteins expressed in different cells display distinct N-glycosylation patterns. In particular, the glycosylation of the S protein in human cells exhibits remarkable heterogeneity on N-glycosites. However, the N-glycan types on each glycosite is primarily determined by the host cells rather than the location of different glycosites ( Fig. 3E-3F, Fig. S8 ).
To confirm site-specific N-glycan occupancy and exploit the potential impact on N-glycosylation by different protein sizes, recombinant RBDs (residues 319-541) from both human and insect cells were further analyzed (Table S6) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.013276 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4B and 4C) are very close to those found in the S ectodomain and S1 subunit ( Fig. 3E and Fig. 3F ). The human cell-produced RBDs displayed more N-glycan compositions and complex glycan types, compared to insect cell-expressed proteins ( Fig. 4B and   4C ). Moreover, more than 80% of glycan compositions are identical at each site among different lengths of insect cell-expressed proteins (Fig. 4D) . Similarly, over 75% of the glycan compositions at each site were found to be shared by human cell-produced products (Fig. 4E ). The N-glycosylation of RBDs was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.S9) . These results suggest that the N-glycan compositions are conserved among different sizes of RBD proteins. Taken together, our data reveal the regular heterogeneity of N-glycan compositions at each site of the S protein subunits, primarily depending on host cells and glycosites. Intriguingly, the N-glycan types on S protein subunits are predominantly determined by host cells, regardless of the location of glycosites.
The global outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 urgently call for specific prevention and intervention measures(22). The development of preventative vaccines and neutralizing antibodies remains a chief goal in the efforts to control viral spread and stockpile candidates for future use. However, this work greatly relies on the understanding of the antigen structure and state of glycosylation for the rational determination of accessible epitopes. The S protein is posited to be the main or even the only antigen on viral surfaces for priming the immune system to produce an effective response (15, 18). Previous studies have revealed the structural information of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found the coverage of N-glycans (4, 10) . In this study, we profiled the site-specific N-glycosylation of the recombinant . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

All potential N-glycosites on the S protein were identified experimentally. The N-glycan compositions and types on S protein subunits were revealed among different host cells. Our data provide a large-scale N-glycosylation information of the S protein and present a promising prospect for developing a vaccine and therapeutic antibodies.
N-glycosylation is a common feature of the viral envelope proteins, including those of HIV-1, Lassa virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus and influenza A virus.
Glycosylation promotes proper glycoprotein folding; however, the glycans obstruct receptor binding and proteolytic processing during antigen presentation(15, 17, 23).
Characterization of the landscape of N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is crucial for promoting immunogen design and prevention of the potential viral evasion of intervention measures (5, 15, 24) . Precise characterization of intact N-glycopeptides can reveal the occupancy of each glycosite by different glycoforms(25, 26). In this study, all 22 N-glycosites of the S protein were identified ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). By comparison, the alteration of N-glycosites among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins focused on glycosites in the S1 subunit (Fig. S6 ). The N-glycosites located in the S2 subunit are completely conserved, and seven out of nine sites, along with glycans have been disclosed by previous studies (4, 5) . Moreover, we found that N-glycosites in the S protein were highly preserved among 145 SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants (Table S5) , which is advantageous for circumventing potential viral immune evasion from the vaccines and neutralizing antibodies currently being developed.
Glycosylation of proteins is intricately processed by various enzymes coordinated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The glycan composition and structure decoration at specific sites occurred in a non-templated manner governed by host cells, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.013276 doi: bioRxiv preprint thus frequently resulting in a heterogeneous glycan occupancy on each glycosite(27).
Glycosylation processing in insect and human cells can yield a common intermediate N-glycan, which will further elongate in human cells but is only trimmed in insect cells to form end products(19). Consequently, the S protein expressed in human cells displayed a larger size and a much higher proportion of complex N-glycans than that expressed in insect cells, owing to the additional elongation of the glycan backbone with multiple oligosaccharides (Fig. 3C-3F ). Our findings are in line with those of previous studies, that demonstrated the predominant complex of N-glycans attached to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV proteins (4, 5, 28) . Moreover, two recent preprint studies have revealed that the complex N-glycans dominate the glycosites on human cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein(29, 30). In contrast, S protein expression in insect cells led to a high ratio of high-mannose N-glycans ( Fig. 3C and 3E ), which has also been found in the insect cell-produced HCoV-NL63 S protein, despite expression in a different insect cell, the Drosophila S2 cell, in the previous study(15).
Notably, a low ratio (~12%) of high-mannose glycans ubiquitously exist on human cell-expressed S protein (Fig. 3F ). The HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 is heavily decorated with the immature intermediate, high-mannose glycans. The high-density glycans surrounding HIV glycoproteins limit the accessibility of glycan biosynthetic processing enzymes, terminating the synthesis of more complex end products(17, 24).
By contrast, the high ratio of complex N-glycans in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were successfully processed on most glycosites by the enzymes, without extensive obstruction by the on-going synthesis of glycan shields ( Fig. 3F and Fig. 4C ).
Therefore, we posit that the glycan coverage on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein could leave relatively accessible antigens and epitopes, although the complex N-glycans might mask some surface immunogens. These features may provide a promising . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This potential is bolstered by the findings that the convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (7) . A previous study on SARS-CoV has revealed that the oligomannose on the S protein can be recognized by The remarkable heterogeneity of N-glycosylation in the S protein subunit expressed in human cells was revealed in our study (Fig. 3F) . By contrast, the N-glycosylation of the S protein subunit in insect cells showed less heterogeneity and complexity than that of human cell-derived proteins (Fig. 3E) . Moreover, the site-specific glycan occupancy tended to be identical in the same host cell, regardless of protein length ( Fig. 4D and 4E) . These results indicate the N-glycan compositions and types on S protein largely attribute to different host cells with the differential processing .

We can expect that the native N-glycosylation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in humans tends to be consistent with that of the recombinant protein expressed in human cells, unless the virus buds off early in the glycosylation processing pathway and produces immature glycans (19, 27, 35) .
Intriguingly, the immature N-glycans such as high-mannose are regarded as "non-self" glycans (35, 36). Therefore, the insect cell-expressed recombinant antigens decorated with paucimannose and high mannose are more immunogenic in mice than those The insect cell-produced S protein subunits could prime protective immunity against the "non-self" oligomannose N-glycans, in case of the immature N-glycans linked to the native envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which seems to occur in the SARS-CoV replication(35). In contrast, the human cell-expressed S protein subunits as vaccines mimic the "self" glycans in human, which are not expected to boost immune response to the glycoantigens. However, the remaining accessible and non-glycosylated regions can serve as the antigens and epitopes. The rational design of antigens to prime potent and broad immune responses against accessible epitopes on SARS-CoV S protein is essential and promising.

The RBD-containing subunit is an ideal immunogen since antibodies against the
RBD has been demonstrated to induce potent and long-term immunity in animal models(40). Meanwhile, the subunit vaccines are posited to minimize the potentially undesired immunopotentiation of the full-length S protein, which might induce severe acute injury in the lungs(41). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 is missing one N-glycosite in RBD compared to SARS-CoV. The remaining two N-glycosites were outside of the motifs essential for direct interaction with the ACE2 receptor(11) (Fig. 2C) . The glycan compositions of RBD are highly identical in the same host cell, regardless of the length of the RBD-containing proteins (Fig. 4B-4E ). These features of the RBD, along with its highly exposed structure, endow more antigens and accessible epitopes for vaccine design and immune recognition. The RBD-containing proteins, especially the insect cell-expressed products, could become promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. However, drug discovery related to glycosylation inhibition is supposed to be performed based on human cell-expressed products.
In this study, we decoded a global and site-specific profile of N-glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 S proteins expressed from insect and human cells, revealing a regular heterogeneity in N-glycan composition and site occupancy. All glycosites were conserved among the 753 public SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. In conclusion, our data indicate that differential N-glycan occupancies among distinct host cells might help elucidate the infection mechanism and develop an effective vaccine and targeted drugs. Nevertheless, the implication of S protein site-specific N-glycosylation in immunogenicity, receptor binding, and viral infectivity should be investigated further.
