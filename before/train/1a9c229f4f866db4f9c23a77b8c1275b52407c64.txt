Early in planta detection of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae in pomegranate using 2 enhanced loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay 3 4 Abstract 33 Bacterial blight in pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) is an 34 increasing threat for pomegranate cultivation in India. To prevent the economic losses, it is pivotal 35 to detect the infection in latent stages rather than in later stages. We have developed an enhanced 36 method termed as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to evaluate for the 37 latent detection of Xap in pomegranate using six set of specific primers. Three DNA intercalating 38 dyes were used, such as Ethidium bromide, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and SYBR Green which 39 resulted in visualising the positivity for LAMP assay. The reaction time and temperature were to 40 be 65°C from 30 min onwards, for the dyes and its sensitivity was observed up to 10 -7 ng in the 41 LAMP assay. For field applicability, LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day post infection while the 42 PCR amplified Xap after 11 th day post infection. Finally, the specificity of LAMP assay was 43 validated to be positive with ten Xap isolates for its accuracy and 29 non-Xap bacterial isolates 44 showed negative results. Moreover, this method could be used as a better alternative to PCR based 45 methods, for early detection of the pathogens. 46 47 50 Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an important fruit crop widely cultivated from tropical to 51 temperate conditions [1]. India ranks first in the world for maximum area under pomegranate 52 cultivation (0.125 million hectares) and Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major 53 pomegranate growing states [2]. The bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. 54 punicae (Xap) in pomegranate was first reported in India in 1952 and presently it has a serious 55 outbreak in all major pomegranate-growing states resulting in a major economic loss. Prominent 56 small water-soaked and dark irregular spots appearing on the leaf are the typical symptoms induced 57 by this pathogen. The pathogen infect the fruit, stem, branches causing cracking symptoms and 58 ultimately leads to yield loss up to 80 percent [3]. .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint 59 Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40% of the crop cultivated gets destroyed 60 annually due to pests and diseases [4]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 61 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important 62 and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time 63 of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) 64 [5,6]. 65 The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include 66 immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [7] and molecular 67 methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [8] and Southern blotting [9]. The methods for 68 early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be 69 competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment 70 facilities [10]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high 71 quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for 72 changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process 73 to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm 74 the amplification [11]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in 75 developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal 76 amplification (LAMP) [12]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis 77 technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. 78 The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65º C, which 79 can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [13]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective 80 and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as 81 positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending 82 much time [14]. 83 The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal 84 RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different 85 bacteria [15-17]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their 86 nine (V1 -V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [18]. These regions are 87 highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize 90 eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [20]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 91 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These 92 six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable 93 generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-94 priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop 95 is produced as a final product [21]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely 96 used to detect broad range of microorganisms[22,23]. The present study was aimed to detect the 97 bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by 98 optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less 99 technical skills.

In planta detection 282 This study aimed to detect Xap by LAMP assay at the early crop stage where the leaf was 283 mechanically pricked with bacterial blight pathogen to inoculate it to healthy pomegranate plants. 284 Three months old pomegranate plant (Bhagwa va.) was grown under controlled environment in a 285 glass house with 85% humidity. Xap1 bacterial culture was resuspended in sterile water and 286 inoculated on healthy plants using pin prick method. The prominent symptoms were observed from 287 the 11 th day after post inoculation, the oily lesions on the leaf surface were observed, which are 288 characteristic symptoms of the bacterial blight disease. The crude DNA isolation method was 289 followed to isolate DNA from the inoculated plants, every alternative day. After the pathogen 290 infectivity in the healthy plants, LAMP assay in agarose gel showed positive from 7 th day onwards 291 (Fig 7b) and for visualizing all the three dyes showed positive LAMP results from the 7 th day 292 onwards (Fig 7a) , in which the EtBr viewed to be most prominent comparing with other and its 293 absorbance intensity was increased with days (Fig 7d) . All the crude isolated DNA samples in 294 PCR method showed amplification from 11 th day onwards (Fig 7c) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Since HNB is added in the LAMP reaction prior to the 370 process, the colour gradually changes from violet to blue as the dNTP's decreases as 371 amplification takes place. So, using dyes like HNB prior to the preceding LAMP reaction tubes 372 can be ideal to prevent a chance of wrong detection [38] . 373 For field level application, remote laboratories may not be well equipped where LAMP 374 detection technique can be employed in diagnosis of pathogens. This assay can even detect Xap in 375 much earlier crop stage than the traditional PCR method. In our greenhouse study after Xap 376 inoculation the LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day while, PCR method detected from 10 th day 377 onwards. However, the prominent symptoms of Xap infection on the leaf in the glass house study 378 appeared only after 10 th day of inoculation (Fig 7) 379 Improvised field applications such as working with crude extracts from plants with 380 minimal requirement will enhance the importance of the assay for rapid and accurate detection of
