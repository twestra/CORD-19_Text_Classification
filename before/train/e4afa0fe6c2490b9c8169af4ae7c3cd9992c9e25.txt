Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the 27 secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein 28 interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that 29 the 3' and 5' are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5' has the strongest 30 propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 -24000 31 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies 32 significantly. These two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with 33 the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind sialic 34 acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5' can interact with proteins 35
To analyze SARS-CoV-2 structure (reference Wuhan strain MN908947.3), we employed CROSS 12 105 to predict the double-and single-stranded content of RNA genomes such as HIV-1 13 . We found the 106 highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5' (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M protein 107 (nucleotides 26523-27191), spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000), and nucleocapsid N protein 108 (nucleotides 2874-29533; Fig. 1 ) 26 . The lowest density of double-stranded regions were observed 109 at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the non-110 structural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein S (Fig. 1) 111 26 . In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content of 112 spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 113 We used the Vienna method 27 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 114 regions identified with CROSS 13 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 115 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  116 1). Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 117 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 118 119 Our analysis suggests the presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to 120 interact with specific human proteins 11 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured 121 regions have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 14 , which is supported by the fact that 122 structured transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 15, 16 . Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 28 , we observed general conservation of the 155 coding regions (Fig. 3A) . The 5' and 3' show high variability due to experimental procedures of the 156 sequencing and are discarded in this analysis 29 . One highly conserved region is between 157 nucleotides 23000 -24000 in the spike S genomic locus, while sequences up-and downstream are 158 variable (red bars in Fig. 3A) . We then used CROSSalign 13 to compare the structural content 159 (Materials and Methods). High variability of structure is observed for both the 5' and 3' and for 160 nucleotides between 21000 -22000 as well as 24000 -25000, associated with the S region (red bars 161 in Fig. 3A) . The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level (p-value < 162 0.0001; Fisher's test). 163 164 We then compared protein sequences coded by the spike S genomic locus (NCBI reference 165 QHD43416) and found that both sequence (Fig. 3A) and structure (Fig. 2) of nucleotides 23000 -166 24000 are highly conserved. The region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the host 167 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 30 promoting infection and provoking lung injury 168 24, 31 . By contrast, the region upstream of the binding site receptor ACE2 and located in 169 correspondence to the minimum of the structural profile at around nucleotides 22500-23000 ( Fig. 1 ) 170 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This part of 171 the spike S region corresponds to amino acids 243-302 that in MERS-CoV binds to sialic acids 172 regulating infection through cell-cell membrane fusion ( Fig. 3B Our analysis suggests that the structural region between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 of Spike S 176 region is conserved among coronaviruses (Fig. 2) and that the binding site for ACE2 has poor 177 variation in human SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 3B) . By contrast, the region upstream, which has 178 propensity to bind sialic acids 10,33,34 , showed poor structural content and high variability (Fig. 3B) . 179 180
replication 182
In order to obtain insights on how the virus replicates in human cells, we predicted SARS-CoV-2 184 interactions with the whole RNA-binding human proteome. Following a protocol to study structural 185 conservation in viruses 13 , we first divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides 186 each moving from the 5' to 3' and then calculated the protein-RNA interactions of each fragment 187 with catRAPID omics (3340 canonical and putative RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, for a total 188 102000 interactions) 18 . Proteins such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1 (Uniprot 189 P26599) showed the highest interaction propensity (or Z-score; Materials and Methods) at the 5' 190 while others such as Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506) showed the 191 highest interaction propensity at the 3', in agreement with previous studies on coronaviruses (Fig. 192 4A) 35 . 193 194 For each fragment, we predicted the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z 195 score. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z ³ 1.50, 1.75 and 2 196 respectively and we removed from the list the proteins that were predicted to interact promiscuously 197 with more than one fragment. Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5' and is the most contacted by RBPs 198 (around 120 with Z³2 high-confidence interactions; Fig. 4B ), which is in agreement with the 199 observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins 14 . Indeed, the 5' 200 contains multiple stem loop structures that control RNA replication and transcription 36,37 . By 201 contrast, the 3' and fragment 23 (Spike S), which are still structured but to a lesser extent, attract 202 fewer proteins (10 and 5, respectively), while fragment 20 (between orf1ab and Spike S) that is 203 predicted to be unstructured, does not have binding partners. 204 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Proteins interacting with fragments 1, 2 and 29 were associated with 207 annotations related to viral processes ( Fig. 4C ; Supp. Table 1) . Considering the three thresholds 208 applied (Materials and Methods), we found 22 viral proteins for fragment 1, 2 proteins for 209 fragment 2 and 11 proteins for fragment 29 (Fig. 4D) . 210 211 Among the high-confidence interactors of fragment 1, we discovered RBPs involved in positive 212 regulation of viral processes and viral genome replication, such as double-stranded RNA-specific 213 editase 1 ADARB1 (Uniprot P78563 39 ) and 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease RNASEL (Q05823). We 214 also identified proteins related to the establishment of integrated proviral latency, including X-ray 215 repair cross-complementing protein 5 XRCC5 (P13010) and X-ray repair cross-complementing 216 protein 6 XRCC6 (P12956; Fig. 4B ,E). Nucleolin NCL (P19338), a protein known to be involved 217 in coronavirus processing, was predicted to bind tightly to the 5' (Supp. Table 1 ) 40 . 218 219 Importantly, we found proteins related to defence response to viruses, such as ATP-dependent RNA 220 helicase DDX1 (Q92499), that are involved in negative regulation of viral genome replication. MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 4E) 44, 45 . 235
Interestingly, some proteins, including DDX1, CCNT1 and ZNF175 for fragment 1 and TRIM32 236 for fragment 2, have been shown to be necessary for HIV functions and replication inside the cell. 237
The roles of these proteins in retroviral replication are expected to be different in SARS-CoV-2. As 238 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

We note that out of 332 interactions, 60 are RBPs (as reported in Uniprot 39 ), which represents a 261 considerable fraction (i.e., 20%), considering that there are around 1500 RBPs in the human 262 proteome (i.e., 6%) and fully justified by the fact that they involve association with viral RNA. 263
Comparing the RBPs present in Gordon et al. 57 and those present in our list (79 as in Uniprot), we 264 found an overlap of 6 proteins (representation factor = 26.5; p-value < 10 -8 ; hypergeometric test), 265 including: Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1 JAKMIP1 (Q96N16), A-kinase 266 anchor protein 8 AKAP8 (O43823) and A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L (Q9ULX6), which 267 in case of HIV-1 infection is involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase binding 58 , signal 268 recognition particle subunit SRP72 (O76094), binding to the 7S RNA in presence of SRP68, La-269 related protein 7, LARP7 (Q4G0J3) and La-related protein 4B LARP4B (Q92615), which are part 270 of a system for transcriptional regulation acting by means of the 7SK RNP system 59 ( Fig. 4F ; 271

We speculate that sequestration of these elements is 273 orchestrated by a viral program aiming to recruit host genes 46 . Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ and Nucleolin NCL 40 . In addition, we 367 discovered that the highly structured region at the 5' has the largest number of protein partners 368 including ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1, which was previously reported to be essential for 369 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
