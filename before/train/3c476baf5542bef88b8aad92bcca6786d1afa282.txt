Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health and economic burden in affected countries. The availability of genomic data is key to understand viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR amplified viral sequences (targeted metagenomics), is the most informative approach to monitor the viral dissemination and genetic diversity.
Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper reproducibility and comparison of results.
Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerised and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV sequencing data, both from shotgun and targeted metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement of extensive bioinformatics expertise.
Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples of varying serotype and genotype, including a spiked sample containing the existing four serotypes. The second dataset consisted of 106 targeted metagenomics samples of DENV 3 genotype III where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity.
The DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM. The Dengue virus (DENV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus 2 genus, is one of the most prevalent arboviruses and is mainly concentrated in tropical and subtropical 3 regions. Infection with DENV results in symptoms ranging from mild fever to haemorrhagic fever and 4 shock syndrome [1]. Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes namely 5 Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus [2] In 2010, it was predicted that the burden of dengue disease 6 reached 390 million cases per year worldwide [3]. The high morbidity and mortality of dengue makes 7 it the arbovirus with the highest clinical significance [4]. 8 The viral genome of ∼11,000 nucleotides, consists of a Coding Sequence (CDS) of approximately 9
10.2 Kb that is translated into a single polyprotein encoding three structural proteins (capsid -C, 10 premembrane -prM, envelope -E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 11 NS4B and NS5. Additionally, the genome contains two Non-Coding Regions (NCRs) at their 5' and 12 3' ends [5].
DENV can be classified into four serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4), differing from each other by 25% to 14 40% at the amino acid level. They are further classified into genotypes that vary by up to ∼3% 15 at the amino acid level [2]. The DENV-1 serotype comprises five genotypes (I-V), DENV-2 groups 16 six (I-VI, also named American, Cosmopolitan, Asian-American, Asian II, Asian I and Sylvatic), 17 DENV-3 four (I-III and V), and DENV-4 also four (I-IV). 18 DENV is a significant public health challenge in countries where the infection is endemic due 19 to the high health and economic burden. Despite the emergence of novel therapies and ecological 20 strategies to control the mosquito vector, there are still important knowledge gaps in the virus biology 21 and its epidemiology [2].
The implementation of a surveillance system relying on High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) 23 technologies allows the simultaneous identification and surveillance of DENV cases. Due to the 24 high sensitivity of these technologies, previous studies showed that viral sequences can be directly 25 obtained from patient sera using a shotgun metagenomics approach [6]. Alternatively, HTS can be 26 used in a targeted metagenomics approach in which a PCR step is used to pre-amplify viral sequences 27 before sequencing. In recent years, HTS has been successfully used as a tool for identification of 28 DENV directly from clinical samples [6, 7]. This also allows the rapid identification of the serotype 29 and genotype important for disease management as the genotype may be associated with disease 30 outcome [8].
31 Several initiatives aim to facilitate the identification of the DENV serotype and genotype from 32 HTS data. The Genome Detective project (https://www.genomedetective.com/) offers an online 33 Dengue Typing Tool (https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/dengue/) relying on 34 BLAST and phylogenetic methods in order to identify the closest serotype and genotype, but it 35 requires as input assembled genomes in FASTA format. Alternatively, the same project offers 36 a Genome Detective Typing Tool (https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/virus/) 37 identifying viruses present in a sample.
We developed DEN-IM as a ready-to-use, one-stop, reproducible bioinformatic analysis workflow 39 for the processing and phylogenetic analysis of DENV using paired-end raw HTS data. DEN-IM is 40 implemented in Nextflow [9], a workflow manager software that uses Docker (https://www.docker. 41 com) containers with pre-installed software for all the workflow tools. The DEN-IM workflow, as well 42 as parameters and documentation, are available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM. 43 3 The DEN-IM Workflow 44 DEN-IM is a user-friendly automated workflow allowing the analysis of shotgun or targeted metage-45 nomics data for the identification, serotyping, genotyping, and phylogenetic analysis of DENV. It is 46 implemented in Nextflow, a workflow management system that allows the effortless deployment and 47 3 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a

The workflow is composed of five blocks: 1. Quality Control and Trimming, 2. Retrieval of DENV 49 sequences, 3. Assembly, 4. in silico Typing, and 5. Phylogeny, described in more detail in Figure 1 . 50 DEN-IM accepts as input raw paired-end sequencing data (FASTQ files), and informs the user with 51 an interactive HTML report with information on the quality control, mapping, assembly typing and 52 phylogenetic analysis, as well as all the output files of the whole pipeline. 53 3.1 1. Quality Control and Trimming 54 The Quality Control (QC) and Trimming block starts with a process to verify the integrity of the 55 input data. If the sequencing files are corrupted, the execution of the analysis of that sample is 56 terminated. 57 The sequences are then processed by FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ 58 projects/fastqc/, version 0.11.7) to determine the quality of the individual base pairs of the 59 raw data files. The low quality bases and adapter sequences are trimmed by Trimmomatic [10] 60 (version 0.36). By default, Trimmomatic removes the Illumina Nextera, TruSeq2 and TruSeq3 adapter 61 sequences that are detected, and relies on Phred scores [11] and FastQC analysis data to determine 62 to which extend the 5' and 3' ends of the reads need to be trimmed. The crop and headcrop setting 63 is calculated per sample, based on the GC ratio of each half of the read. By default, the window size 64 is set to 5 nucleotides with a minimum average quality of 20. In addition, paired-end reads with a 65 read length shorter than 55 nucleotides after trimming are removed from further analyses. 66 Lastly, the low complexity sequences, containing over 50% of poly-A, poly-N or poly-T nucleotides, 67 are filtered out of the raw data using PrinSeq [12] (version 0.10.4).
68 3.2 2. Retrieval of DENV Sequences 69 In the second step, DENV sequences are selected from the sample using Bowtie2 [13] (version 70 2.2.9) and Samtools [14] (version 1.4.1). As a reference we provide the DENV mapping database, a 71 curated DENV database composed of 3830 complete DENV genomes (see Methods, DENV Reference 72
Database). A permissive approach is followed by allowing for mates to be kept in the sample even 73 when only one read maps to the database in order to keep as many DENV derived reads as possible.
The output of this step is a set of processed reads of putative DENV origin. 75 3.3 3. Assembly 76 DEN-IM applies a two assembler approach to generate assemblies of the DENV CDS. To obtain a 77 high confidence assembly, the processed reads are first de novo assembled with SPAdes [15] (version 78 3.12.0). If the full CDS fails to be assembled into a single contig, the data is re-assembled with 79 MEGAHIT assembler [16] (version 1.1.3), a more permissive assembler developed to retrieve longer 80 sequences from metagenomics data. The resulting assemblies are corrected with Pilon [17] (version 81 1.22) after mapping the processed reads to the assemblies with Bowtie2 [13]. 82 If more than one complete CDS is present in a sample, each of the sequences will follow the rest 83 of the DEN-IM workflow independently. If no full CDS is assembled neither with SPAdes nor with 84 MEGAHIT, the processed reads are passed on to the next step for consensus generation by mapping, 85 effectively constituting DEN-IM's two pronged approach using both assemblers and mapping.
86 3.4 4. Typing 87 For each DENV complete CDS, the serotype and genotype is determined with the Seq Typing tool 88 (https://github.com/B-UMMI/seq_typing, version 2.0) [18] using BLAST [19] and the custom 89 Typing database of DENV containing 161 complete sequences (see Methods, DENV Reference 90 Database). The BLAST results are first cleaned to get the best hit for each sequence in the database, 91 based on alignment length, similarity, e-value and number of gaps. The tool determines which 92 reference sequence is more closely related to the query based on the identity and length of the 93 sequence covered, returning the serotype and genotype of the reference sequence for the purpose of 94 classifying the query.
If a complete CDS fails to be obtained through the assembly process, the processed reads are 96 mapped against the DENV typing database, with Bowtie2 [13], using Seq Typing tool, with similar 97 criteria for coverage and identity to those used with the BLAST approach. If a type is determined, 98 the consensus sequence obtained follows through to the next step in the workflow. Otherwise, the 99 sample is classified as Non-Typable and its process terminated. 100 3.5 5. Phylogeny 101 All DENV complete CDSs and consensus sequences analysed in a workflow execution are aligned 102 with MAFFT [20] (version 7.402), in auto mode and with orientation being automatically determined 103 and adjusted. With the resulting alignment, a Maximum Likelihood tree is inferred with RaXML [21] 104 (version 8.2.11), using as default the GTR-Γ substitution model and a 500 times bootstrap. 105 Optionally, the closest reference sequence in the DENV typing database to each analysed sample 106 can be retrieved and included in the phylogenetic analysis. 107 4 Workflow Execution 108 The DEN-IM workflow can be executed in any UNIX-based system, from local machines to high-109 performance computing clusters (HPC) facilities with Nextflow and a container engine installation, 110 such as Docker (https://www.docker.com/, Shifter [22] or Singularity [23]. 111 Due to its Nextflow implementation, DEN-IM allows for out-of-the-box high-level parallelization 112 and offers direct support for distributed computational environments. DEN-IM integrates Docker 113 containerised images for all the tools necessary for its execution, ensuring reproducibility and the 114 tracking of both software code and version, regardless of the operating system used. The Docker 115 images provided are also compatible with other container engines. 116 Users can customise the workflow execution either by using command line options or by modifying 117 a simple plain-text configuration file (params.config). The version of each of the tools used in 118 DEN-IM can be changed by providing new container tags in the appropriate configuration file 119 (containers.config). The resources for each process can also be changed (resources.config). To make 120 the execution of the workflow as simple as possible, a set of default parameters and directives is 121 provided. 122 The local installation of the DEN-IM workflow, including the docker containers with all the tools 123 needed and the curated DENV database, requires 15 Gigabytes of free disk space. The minimum 124 requirements to execute the workflow are at least 5 Gigabytes of memory and 4 CPUs, although 7 125 Gigabytes of memory is advised. The disk space required for execution depends greatly on the size 126 of the input data, but for the datasets used in this article DEN-IM generates approximately 20 Gb 127 data per Gb of input data. 128 5 Output and Report 129 The output files of all tools are stored in the 'results' folder in the directory of the DEN-IM execution.
130 The execution log file for each component, as well as a log file for the execution of the workflow, are 131 also available. 132 DEN-IM creates an interactive HTML report (Figure S1), stored in the 'pipeline results' directory, 133 containing all the information in the results divided into four sections: report overview, tables, charts 134 and phylogenetic tree. The report can be easily exchanged between collaborators by compressing 135 and sharing the "pipeline report" folder. 136 The report overview contains information about the number of samples in the analysis. It allows 137 for selection, filtering and highlighting of particular samples and tools in the workflow. 138 The table section contains the results and statistics the quality control, assembly, read mapping 139 and in silico typing results. The in silico typing table contains the results of the serotype and 140 genotype of each CDS analysed, as well as identity and coverage and GenBank ID for the closest 141 reference in the DENV typing database. doi: bioRxiv preprint 206 was generated.

CC-BY 4.0 doi: bioRxiv preprint As a positive control sample, the supernatant of a viral culture containing DENV-2 strain 16681 388 was used. The negative control sample consisted of DNA-and RNA-free water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 389 Louis, MO, USA). 390 A spiked sample was produced consisting of a mixture of four 5 µl of cDNA isolated from clinical 391 samples including all DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to -4). The viral cDNA for these samples was not in 392 equal concentration and the viral copy number in the clinical samples was assessed by RT-PCR [35].

The results were as follow: DENV-2 with 1070000 copies/µl, DENV-1 with 117830 copies/µl, DENV-3 394 with 44300 copies/µl and DENV-4 with 6600 copies/µl.
The cDNA libraries were generated using either the NEBNext R RNA First and Second strand 396 modules and the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (NXT), or the TruSeq RNA V2 library 397 preparation kit (TS).

• Understanding DENV transmission in populations where the infection is endemic through the use of metagenomics is a most promising strategy to get insight into the dissemination of the virus and to support measures to prevent or decrease further spread.
• So far, the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of results encounters computational challenges, and requires appropriate expertise and infrastructure, which poses a challenge for the implementation of metagenomic approaches.
• We present DEN-IM, a reproducible, containerised and user-friendly workflow for the identification and characterisation of DENV from shotgun and targeted metagenomics data.
• The HTML reports obtained with DEN-IM can be easily shared, facilitating comparison of results from across the globe. Figure 1 . The DEN-IM workflow separated into five different components. The raw sequencing reads are provided as input to the first block (in blue), responsible for quality control and elimination of low-quality reads and sequences. After successful pre-processing of the reads, these enter the second block (green) for retrieval of the DENV reads using the mapping database of 3830 complete DENV genomes as reference. This block also provides an initial estimate of the sequencing depth. After the de novo assembly and assembly correction block (yellow), the coding sequences (CDSs) are retrieved and are then classified with the reduced complexity DENV typing database containing 161 sequences representing the known diversity of DENV serotypes and genotypes (red).If a complete CDS fails to be assembled, the reads are mapped against the DENV typing database and a consensus sequence is obtained for classification and phylogenetic inference. All CDSs are aligned and compared in a phylogenetic analysis (purple). Lastly, a report is compiled (gray) with the results of all the blocks of the workflow. Figure S1 ).
The assembled contig size distribution scatter plot is available in the chart section, showing 153 the contig size distribution for the Pilon corrected assembled CDSs. The serotype and genotype was successfully determined for the 24 DENV CDSs by BLAST 186 ( Figure S1 , Table 1 ). The most common were serotype 2 genotype III (AsianAmerican) and serotype 187 4 genotype II, with 8 samples each (33.33%), followed by serotype 3 genotype III (n=5, 20.83%), (Table S2) .
Of the 106 samples, 43 (40.60%) managed to assemble a complete CDS sequence (Table S1) 205 whereas a mapping approach was used for the remaining 63 samples (59.90%) and a consensus CDS In all samples DENV 3-III was correctly identified, demonstrating the success of DEN-IM's two 239 pronged approach of combining assemblers and mapping.

The interactive HTML reports ( Figure S1 ) provide an intuitive platform for data exploration, 254 allowing the user to highlight specific samples, filter and re-order the data tables, and export the In conclusion, we provide a user-friendly workflow that makes it possible to analyse paired-end raw The burden of DENV disease is already large, but is still increasing as the risk of exposure to the 276 virus is increasing, not only through travel to endemic areas but also due to the expansion of the 277 geographic areas of the mosquito vectors and the disease [30] . genotypes, all four genotypes present in the spiked sample were accurately detected. This raises 288 the possibility that DEN-IM can play a role in the identification of these cases whose prevalence 289 is increasingly appreciated in highly endemic areas. Moreover, although being ready-to-use, the 290 DEN-IM workflow can be easily customised to optimise the data analysis. were removed and only the sequences with sub-type data were kept. A representative of DENV 303 serotype 1 genotype III was introduced (EF457905, recovered from monkey) as no representatives 304 were available with the search criteria used. This genotype is Sylvatic and considered extinct [31] [32].
Additionally, any sample with IUPAC codes in the sequence provided were excluded.
In order to recover the maximum number of DENV reads from the input HTS data in the first 307 mapping step (Figure 1) , we maintained the database with the 3830 complete DENV genomes to 308 retain as much diversity as possible. This database is referred as "DENV mapping database". (Table S4) , 63 DENV-2 (Table S5) , 25 DENV-3 (Table S6 ) and 27 DENV-4 (Table S7 ). This database 313 is referred as "DENV typing database". This step is necessary to speed up the classification step for (Table S4 ). In order to harmonise dengue nomenclature, the 324 system adopted uses Roman-numeric labels to identify the genotype, with the exception of Serotype 325 2 (Table S5) , which used both Roman-numeric and geographic origin due to the widespread adoption 326 of the latter. The short-read paired-end data is passed as input through the "-fastq" parameter, that by default 329 is set to match all files in the "fastq" folder that match the pattern "* R1,2* ". In the process to 330 verify the integrity of the paired-end raw sequencing data, the integrity of the input files is assessed 331 by attempting to decompress and read the files. An estimation of the depth of coverage is also 332 performed. By default, the input size ("-genomeSize") is set to 0.012 Mb and the minimum coverage 333 depth ("-minCoverage") is set to 10. If any input file is found to be corrupt, its progression in the 334 workflow is aborted.
In the FastQC and Trimmomatic module, FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham. 336 ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is run with the parameters "-extract -nogroup -format fastq". FastQC 337 will inform Trimmomatic [10] on how many bases to trim from the 3'and 5' ends of the raw reads. The removal of low complexity sequences is done with PrinSeq [12] using a custom parameter 343 ("-pattern"), which by default is set to the value "A 50%; T 50%; N 50%", removing sequences whose To retrieve the reads that map to the DENV reference database, Bowtie2 [13] is run with default parameters with the DENV mapping database as a reference. The reads and their mates that map 347 to the reference are retrieved with "samtools view -buh -F 12 " and "samtools fastq" commands.
The DENV mapping database can be altered with the "-reference" parameter, or alternatively, a 349 Bowtie2 index can be provided with the "-index " parameter. This allows for the workflow to work 350 with other databases obtained through public and owned DENV genomes. The coverage estimation 351 step is performed on the retrieved DENV reads with the same parameters are the first estimation 352 ("-genomeSize=0.012" and "-minCoverage=10").
In the assembly process, the retrieved DENV reads are firstly assembled with SPAdes Genome 354 Assembler [15] with the options "-careful -only-assembler -cov-cutoff ". The coverage cutoff if 355 dictated by the "-spadesMinCoverage" and "-spadesMinKmerCoverage" parameters, set to 2 by 356 default. If the assembly with SPAdes fails to produce a contig equal or greater than the value 357 defined in the "-minimumContigSize" parameter (default of 10000), the data is re-assembled with the 358 MEGAHIT assembler [16] with default parameters. By default the k-mers to be used in the assembly 359 in both tools ("-spadesKmers" and "-megahitKmers") are automatically determined depending on 360 the read size. If the maximum read length is equal or greater than 175 nucleotides, the assembly is 361 done with the k-mers "55, 77, 99, 113, 127", otherwise the k-mers "21, 33, 55, 67, 77" are used.
To correct the assemblies produced, the Pilon tool [17] is run after mapping the QC'ed reads 363 back to the assembly with Bowtie2 and "samtools sort". This process also verifies the coverage and 364 the number of contigs produced in the assembly. The behaviour can be altered with the parameters 365 "-minAssemblyCoverage", "-AMaxContigs" and "-genomeSize", set to "auto", 1000 and 0.01 Mb by 366 default. The first parameter, when set to 'auto', the minimum assembly coverage for each contig 367 required is set to the 1/3 of the assembly mean coverage or to a minimum of 10x. The ratio of contig 368 number per genome MB is calculated based on the genome size estimation for the samples.
The contigs larger than the value defined in the "-size" parameter (default of 10000 nucleotides) 370 are considered to be complete CDSs and follow the rest to the workflow independently. If no complete 371 CDS is recovered, the QC'ed read data is passed to the mapping to module that does the DENV 372 typing database and consensus generation.
The serotyping and genotyping is performed with the Seq Typing tool [18] with the command 374 "seq typing.py assembly" or "seq typing.py reads", using as reference the provided curated DENV 375 typing database.
