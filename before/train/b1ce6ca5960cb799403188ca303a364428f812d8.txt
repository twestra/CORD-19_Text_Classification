Manipulation of natural mosquito populations using the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is being 21 investigated as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne viruses. To evaluate the 22 efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in 23
Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this 24 need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low 25 sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and 26 technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, 27
we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand 28 displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform 29 for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids 30 from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single 31 endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We 32 demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome 33 oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection 34 of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the 35 coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti 36 mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37 °C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-37 OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus 38 mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, 39 minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-40 cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited 41 conditions. 42 43 All rights reserved.

Mosquitoes spread many human pathogens and novel approaches are required to reduce the 45 burden of mosquito-borne disease. One promising approach is transferring Wolbachia into 46
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes where it blocks transmission of arboviruses like dengue, Zika and 47
Yellow fever viruses and spreads through mosquito populations. For effective evaluation of this 48 approach, regular surveillance of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti is required, but current 49 diagnostic tools are not well suited to support these critical surveillance needs. To fill this need 50
we developed a simple, robust and inexpensive assay to identify Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and 51
Wolbachia using our unique one-pot assay platform, LAMP-OSD, which uses loop-mediated 52 isothermal amplification to amplify nucleic acid targets at a single temperature. Unlike other 53 LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid 54 strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification 55 products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye 56 and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are 57 compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid 58 extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone 59 tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C 60 while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay 61 could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. 62
Our easy to use and easy to interpret assays should facilitate widespread field mosquito 63 surveillance with minimal instrumentation and high accuracy. 64 65 66 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Traditionally considered a problem for tropical regions, mosquitoes are increasingly 69 becoming a global public health challenge [2, 3] due to a changing global environment, urbanization, 70 increases in the global movement of populations, and the emergence of insecticide resistance [4]. 71
Estimates suggest nearly half the world's population is at risk for mosquito-borne diseases [5, 6], 72 and as such, there is an urgent need for novel approaches to reduce the burden of disease.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/291849 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 traditional morphological-based approaches cannot detect associated symbionts or pathogens. 91 These limitations restrict widespread accessibility and necessitate sample preservation and 92 transport. On the other end of the spectrum, immunoassay-based tools for identifying pathogen-93 infected mosquitoes, such as VecTest TM dipsticks (Medical Analysis Systems Inc.), are portable 94 and inexpensive. However, these tests have poor sensitivity [23-25] and are not necessarily 95 available for distinguishing mosquito species or identifying Wolbachia endosymbionts. 96 Nucleic acid tests can provide the necessary sensitivity and versatility for identifying both 97 Wolbachia and mosquito species. However, since molecular testing is currently heavily reliant on 98 PCR [26-28], opportunities for field-based determinations are limited, leading to significant delays 99 and gaps in actionable surveillance. To support widespread vector surveillance inexpensive, 100
portable, nucleic acid diagnostic platforms are needed that rapidly produce accurate results without 101 requiring complex procedures, instruments, and laboratory infrastructure. In this regard, isothermal 102 nucleic acid amplification assays such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have 103 begun to be employed because they do not require complex thermocycling instruments [29][30][31]. 104
However, although LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity it often produces spurious amplicons, which 105 in turn lead to false positive readouts with non-specific reporters such as Mg 2+ precipitation or 106 fluorescent dye intercalation [32][33][34]. 107
To mitigate the spurious signals that arise with LAMP, we have previously applied principles that 108
were developed for nucleic acid strand exchange circuits [35][36][37][38] to the design of short hemiduplex 109 oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes for LAMP [39]. The single stranded 'toehold' 110 regions of OSD probes bind to LAMP amplicon loop sequences, and then signal via strand 111 exchange [40] that leads to separation of a fluorophore and quencher [39]. OSDs are the 112 functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and can specifically report single or multiplex LAMP 113 amplicons without interference from non-specific nucleic acids or inhibitors [39, 41]. OSDs 114 significantly enhance the diagnostic applicability of LAMP, allowing it to match the allelic specificity 115 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
One biocontrol countermeasure gaining traction for mosquito control is the release of Wolbachia-74 infected mosquitoes [7] [8] [9] . Wolbachia is a maternally-transmitted endosymbiont that can rapidly 75 become established in the natural mosquito populations and can inhibit a variety of pathogens, 76 including arboviruses, malaria parasites, and filarial nematodes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Wolbachia control 77 strategies are currently being deployed into the field to alter the capacity of Aedes aegypti to transmit 78 arboviruses or to suppress mosquito populations [16] [17] [18] . Surveillance of transinfected mosquitoes 79 as well as natural vector populations is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions [19] . 80
However, most current screening methods rely on PCR, which is expensive and relies on 81 laboratory facilities. In addition to screening for Wolbachia infection, it would also be desirable to 82 identify the host mosquito species using these assays since different mosquito species differ in 83 their ability to transmit pathogens [20] . Knowledge of vector species, and prevalence and stability 84 of Wolbachia is essential for effective vector control and pre-emption of disease outbreaks with 85 public health measures [21] . 86
Unfortunately, mosquitoes are most commonly identified using morphological taxonomic keys. 87
This process can be tedious, and requires highly trained personnel and undamaged mosquitoes. 88
Alternative morphological methods such as the identification of morphometric wing characters 89
[22] are low throughput and require microscopes and complex imaging instruments. Moreover, 90 were selected and maintained in an E. coli Top10 strain. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from 142 these strains using the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All target inserts were 143 verified by sequencing at the Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology Core DNA Sequencing 144
Facility. 145
Wolbachia wAlbB and wPip strain wsp genes and Ae. aegypti coi gene sequences were obtained 147 from NCBI GenBank. Consensus signature sequences were derived following MUSCLE 148 The Primer Explorer v5 primer design software (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan) was used for 154 generating several potential LAMP primer sets composed of the outer primers F3 and B3 and the 155 inner primers FIP and BIP. Primer design was constrained to include at least a 40 bp gap between 156 the F1 and F2 or between the B1 and B2 priming sites. Primer specificity for targeted sequence 157 and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human, vector or 158 pathogenic origin were further assessed using NCBI BLAST. 159
These primer sets were functionally tested in LAMP assays using zero to several hundred copies 160 of purified plasmids as templates. Amplification kinetics were measured in real time using the 161 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The fastest primer sets that detected the fewest template copies with negligible spurious reactivity 163 in the absence of templates were selected for further assay development. 164
Fluorogenic OSD probes were then designed to undergo toehold-mediated strand exchange with 165 these Ae. aegypti coi and the Wolbachia wsp LAMP amplicons. Of the two target derived loop 166 regions (between the F1c and F2, and the B1c and B2 primer binding sites) the regions between 167
F1c and F2 were chosen as wsp and coi OSD binding regions. Fluorogenic OSD probes were 168 designed using the NUPACK software and our previously described engineering principles [39] . 169
Briefly the hemiduplex OSDs were designed to display 11-12 nucleotide long single-stranded 170 toeholds on the longer, fluorophore-labeled strands.

LAMP reactions monitored in real time using OSD probes were assembled and analyzed as 195 above with the following changes. First, OSD probes were prepared by annealing 1 µM of the 196 fluorophore-labeled OSD strand with 5 µM of the quencher-labeled strand in 1X Isothermal buffer. Annealing was performed by denaturing the oligonucleotide mix at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 198 slow cooling at the rate of 0.1 °C/s to 25 °C. Excess annealed probe was stored at -20 °C. 199
Annealed OSD probes were added to the LAMP reactions at a final concentration of 100 nM of 200 the fluorophore-bearing strand. 201
LAMP-OSD assays intended for visual readout and smartphone imaging were assembled in 0.2 203 ml optically clear thin-walled tubes with low auto-fluorescence (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA). 204
Following 90 min of amplification at 65 °C, LAMP-OSD reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 1 205 min followed by immediate transfer to room temperature and fluorescence imaging. Images were 206 acquired using an unmodified iPhone 6 and an UltraSlim-LED transilluminator (Syngene, 207

Four to seven day old 217 mosquitoes were collected and immediately frozen for shipment, storage and subsequent testing. 218
To obtain blood fed insects, Aedes mosquitoes were starved for a period of 24 hours then offered 219 a sheep blood meal (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO, USA) using a hemotek membrane 220 system (Hemotek). Unfed mosquitoes were separated and mosquitoes that were engorged were 221 collected 24 hours post feeding and processed in the same manner as unfed mosquitoes. For 222 field collections, female mosquitoes were trapped using Fay prince trap (John W. Hock) baited 223 with CO2 in Galveston, Texas. 90 mosquitoes were morphologically identified and sorted into 224 three blinded groups that were stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and 37 °C, respectively for up to 3 weeks 225 prior to LAMP-OSD analysis. 226
For LAMP-OSD analysis individual mosquitoes were prepared either in 1 cc syringes or in 1.5 ml 228 microcentrifuge tubes as follows. In-syringe preparation: The plunger was removed from a 1 cc 229 syringe and a 0.5 µM pore size 1/8 th inch diameter frit (catalog # 59037, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 230 MO, USA) was placed inside the syringe.

In the absence of target DNA, neither assay generated 281 spurious signal. 282 Our next goal was to demonstrate the ability of these LAMP-OSD assays to detect naturally 290 occurring target sequences in mosquitoes. At the same time, we wanted to ensure that 291 minimally processed samples would be compatible with our detection platform in order to 292 facilitate rapid in-field vector testing with fewest instruments and user-required steps. 293 Therefore, as an initial approach, we developed the 'in-syringe' method for rapid sample 294 preparation wherein individual mosquitoes were crushed inside 1 cc syringes using the syringe 295 plunger as a pestle. A small chromatography column frit placed inside the syringe served as a 296 pedestal that aided maceration and removed larger particulates when the macerated sample 297 was re-suspended in water and recovered. Small portions (up to 8% of a LAMP-OSD reaction) 298 of these macerated samples were added directly to LAMP-OSD reactions, which were then 299 incubated for 90 min at 65 °C to initiate and sustain amplification. 300

The single mosquito that the LAMP-OSD assay failed to identify had been stored at 37 °C for a 368
week prior to testing. We ruled out lack of amplifiable nucleic acids or their incompatibility with 369 coi LAMP primers and OSD probe by PCR amplifying the relevant coi LAMP target and verifying 370 its sequence. 371 372 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
