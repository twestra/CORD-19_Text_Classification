ABSTRCT 29 Given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 30 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) infection , the ongoing global 31 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue. Rapid and precise 32 diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, 33 providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse 34 transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with 35 nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully 36 established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment 37 (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63°C) 38 for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 39 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified 40 and detected in a 'one-step' and 'single-tube' reaction, and the detection results were 41 easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 42 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated 43 from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 44 the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab 45 samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical 46 samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample 47 collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the 48 RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 49 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for 50 resource-challenged regions.

In late December 2019, an unexpected outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory 55 syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) emerged in Wuhan, 56 Hubei province, China, which had previously not been reported in animals or humans 57 (1). By press time, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a huge Hence, there is an urgent requirement for easy-to-use, more rapid and simpler 81 detection techniques for diagnosis of COVID-19.

These results indicated that F1ab-and np-LAMP primer sets were available for 174 establish the COVID-19 RT-LAMP NBS assay for rapid and reliable detection of 175 SARS-CoV-2. The parameter of optimal temperature for COVID-19 RT-LAMP 176 technique also was tested, and reaction temperature of 63°C was used for performing 177 the COVID-19 RT-LAMP amplification (Figure S2 and S3) . The COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was able to detect down 12 copies (each of 181 F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Figure 4) . Two target genes were detected and 182 identified in a one-tube reaction ( Figure 4A) . The COVID-19 RT-LAMP results 183 using NBS were in consistent with turbidity and VDR detection (Figure 4B and 4C) , 184 while traditional monitoring techniques (VDR and turbidity) could not facilitate 185 multiplex analysis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay 186 was in conformity with F1ab-and np-RT-LAMP assay (Figure 4, S4 and S5) . 187 The optimal duration time of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay at the isothermal 188 stage also was determined, and the template level at the detection limit appeared three indicating no cross-reaction with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S2) .
