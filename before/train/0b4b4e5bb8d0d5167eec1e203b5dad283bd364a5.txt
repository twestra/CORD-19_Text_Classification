We began with 111 MET and RAP due to their translational importance in humans 14,27 . However, RAP combined with 112 MET at their optimal doses did not show any further benefit on lifespan (Extended data Fig. 2j,p). We 113 carried out additional trials, exploring all possible combinations of optimal and half-optimal dose for 114 MET and RAP (Extended data Fig. 2j-p). Combination of RAP and MET each at their half-optimal 115 dose result in further extension in maximum lifespan (Fig. 2e, Extended data Fig. 2m,s) but did not 116 result in further mean lifespan extension (Extended data 2p). These weak benefits of combining MET 117 with RAP are consistent with results in mice where the existing evidence suggests that addition of Figures S3 lifespan comparison of triple combinations supplementary for figure 2. a, RAP+RIF+PSORA did not show further benefit compared to the dual synergistic combinations RAP+RIF and RIF+PSORA. b, RAP+RIF+MET is toxic compared to RAP+RIF.

2 Summary 15 Pharmacological interventions that target human ageing would extend individual healthspan and result 16 in dramatic economic benefits to rapidly ageing societies worldwide. For such interventions to be 17 contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which 18 extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be 19 achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs 20 that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow 21 ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-22
offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 23 background, implying the involvement of the TGF and IGF pathways in this synergy. Employing 24 lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in 25 increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best 26 drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, 27 this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This 28 drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved 29 aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and 30 overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.
3 Some of the most important findings in biogerontology are the evolutionarily conserved pathways that 34 regulate lifespan 1-6 . In model organisms, mutations affecting these pathways can often extend lifespan 35 by between 30% and 100% 7,8 . Combining different genetic mutations can result in synergistic lifespan 36 extension 9-11 . By contrast, the effect of pharmacological interventions are typically much weaker, even 37 when targeting the same pathways 2,12,13 , but this genetic synergy suggests a potential strategy for the 38 design of novel pharmacological interventions by simultaneously targeting multiple evolutionarily 39 conserved ageing pathways. To date there is little data on synergistic effects of pharmacological 40 interventions on lifespan 14 . Here we report an in vivo approach to design novel multi-drug ageing 41 interventions. We show how multi-drug interventions leverage pathway synergies to maximize effect 42 size, while minimizing side effects and detrimental developmental tradeoffs through targeting distinct 43 but interacting ageing pathways. Our ultimate aim was to design a purely pharmacological, adult-44 onset intervention with lifespan efficacy similar or better than those of canonical aging mutations did.
Due to the lack of generally accepted biological markers for ageing [15] [16] [17] , lifespan studies are currently 46 the only way to test the efficacy of ageing interventions 18 . We therefore developed our candidate drug 47 combinations in a short-lived model organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using our 48 approach, we identify two triple drug combinations that extend lifespan and healthspan to an extent 49 greater than any previously reported pharmacological intervention in C. elegans 13 . Our synergistic 50 drug combinations show effect sizes comparable to the classical ageing mutations while avoiding 51 most of the tradeoffs associated with them 19-21 . We find that these interventions actually increase some 52 markers of performance while slowing biological ageing rate. Moreover, we identified TGF as a key 53 contributor and required pathway in mediating these synergistic effects. We also find that worms 54 treated with synergistic drug combinations have higher MUFA:PUFA ratios and a decrease in 55 membrane lipid peroxidation index. Finally, we confirm that this synergistic effect is also present in 56 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Table S1 ). We chose to target 75 AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), caloric restriction 76 (CR), C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and mitohormesis/mitochondrial metabolism as primary 77 longevity regulatory pathways. For each pathway, we identified drugs and drug-like molecules 78 reported to extend lifespan in at least one common model organism (nematodes, fruit flies or mice).
We were interested in drugs that might eventually be tested in humans so we favored drugs with 80 reported efficacy in mammals or that are already approved for human use. Based on these criteria, we 81 initially selected eleven candidate drugs (Supplementary Table S1 ). We added allantoin to our study 82 based on a report showing lifespan effects in C. elegans and a transcriptional analysis suggesting that 83 its mode of action is unusually distinct from other compounds 22 Table   97 S3). While transcriptional analyses revealed significant overlap between affected genes, we also 98 identified sets of genes that were unique to each individual compound (Fig. 2a) . MET shows 99 significant overlap with the other drugs, having the smallest unique set. Almost all genes affected by 100 MET and PSORA were also affected by at least one other drug in the set (Fig. 2a) . ALLAN causes 101 fewer gene-expression changes overall than any of the other compounds, but 48% of the genes 102 affected by ALLAN are unique, that is, not affected by any of the other drugs, while only 17% of the 103 genes affected by MET are unique (Fig. 2a 
We then systematically determined the efficacy of all ten possible pairs out of the five candidate drugs 121 (Extended data Fig. 2a-i) . For these trials we define synergy based on the Higher Single Activity 122 (HSA) model 28 ; Drug combinations are considered synergistic if the combinatorial effect is 123 significantly larger than any of the combination's single drug effect at the same (ideal) concentrations 124 as in the combination. Using this definition, we identified two synergistic combinations out of the ten 125 pairs tested (Fig. 2c, 170 Several of the drugs tested have previously been reported to be CR mimetics 17,32-34 . We therefore 171 tested each synergistic combination and its constituent compounds in a C. elegans model of CR (eat-2 172 mutants). We found that only RIF among the single drug treatments further extended lifespan in eat-2 Table S3 ). First we explored the transcriptomics data for changes that 223 might affect lipid composition and found that synergistic drug combinations indeed resulted in a 224 significant up regulation of the C. elegans SREBP-1c homologsbp-1, a master transcription factor 225 controlling several lipogenic genes, and genes coding for "desaturases" responsible for MUFA 226 synthesis 38-40 (Fig. 4c ,e). We then employed an MS-based lipidomics assay to determine changes in 227 lipid compositions that might result from these drug treatments. Worms that were exposed to the 228 synergistic drug combinations have a significant rise in TAG reserves ( lifespan in the optimal (best) health category while nematodes exposed to the RIF+PSORA+ALLAN 253 and RAP+RIF+ALLAN spent 57% and 63%, respectively, of their already extended lifespan in 254 optimal health (Fig. 5d, Extended data 9c ). This means that their health span was significantly 255 extended both in absolute and relative terms. Indeed, more than half of the treated animals were still 256 in optimal health even after the last control animal had died (Fig. 5d, Extended data Fig. 9c ).
257 Surprisingly, animals treated with RAP+RIF+ALLAN and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN also performed 258 significantly better in the spontaneous movement assay than control animals at most ages. In fact, old 259 treated animals (day 18 of age) showed performance in this assay that was indistinguishable from 260 young (day 7) controls ( Fig. 5g) . Moreover, treated animals experienced improvements in resistance 261 to heat and oxidative stress (paraquat) assays, (Figure 5e The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/153205 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 limited detected tradeoffs, but also improved health span, increased stress resistance, and even 264 increased physical performance. Such observations raise the important question if these lifespan 265 benefits are due to an actual delay in biological ageing rate. The rate of ageing can be expressed as 266 mortality rate doubling time (MRDT). We determined MRDT of animals exposed to synergistic drug 267 combinations using Survcurv 53 , and found MRDT to be significantly longer in RIF+PSORA+ALLAN 268 treated animals compared to controls (MRDT of control = 3 days and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN = 3.7 269 days, P value < 0.0001). The initial mortality rate was significantly lower for both synergistic should be noted that cohort size of flies was smaller than for worms and that we did not re-optimize 294 drugs for the fly experiments. However, these data confirms that some of the detected synergies 295 appear to be evolutionary conserved.
By targeting multiple overlapping ageing and longevity-related pathways we succeeded in designing 299 synergistic pharmacological interventions that, even when only applied to animals from adult age, 300 more than doubled healthy lifespan in C. elegans. This effect size is comparable to that of the classical 301 ageing mutations and, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest reported for any adult-onset 302 pharmacological intervention 13 . However, unlike in ageing mutations we detect very limited 303 detrimental evolutionary or fitness tradeoffs associated with this lifespan extension by drug synergies 304 19 . In particular, we did not detect any decrease in oxygen consumption or total fecundity. The latter 305 result is consistent with a previous study showing benefits of an adult-onset intervention using 306 resveratrol without reduced fecundity 56 . These data suggest that there is significant post-9 controls (Fig. 5g) . Mortality analysis suggests that one synergistic drug treatment slows basic 311 biological ageing rate by ~20% (Extended data Fig. 10 ). To test for evolutionary conservation, we 312 determined lifespan benefits in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, confirming qualitative 313 conservation for two of the four synergistic drug combinations. Nematodes are evolutionarily more 314 distant from fruit flies than they are from mammals 57 , making mechanisms and pathways conserved 315 between flies and nematodes ancient, and tracing this synergy back to a common ancestor of all three 316 clades.
To explore the mechanism of these synergistic lifespan benefits, we carried out epistasis experiments 318 and transcriptomic analysis, finding that daf-2/daf-16 (IGF/FOXO) as well as the TGF pathway (daf-319 7) are involved in synergistic lifespan extension (Fig. 4j) 32.4 51.5 *** = P value < 0.0001, ** = P value < 0.001, * = P value < 0.05 Table S3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/153205 doi: bioRxiv preprint Extended data Figure 9 Figure S9 Health span and tradeoffs supplementary for figure 3. a, Drug synergies extended reproductive period. 10 worms per condition. b, Heat shock stress, RIF+PSORA+ALLAN improves heat shock stress resistance both at young, day 4, worms and older, day 15, worms c, Health span scoring at different age.

Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates at 20°C using E. coli OP50 bacteria as food 6

For 8 compound treatments, all agar plates were prepared from the same batch of NGM agar and 9 treatment plates were supplemented with the respective compounds or vehicle as a control. 10
Fresh plates were prepared every week. The following worm strains were used: wild type N2, 11
eat-2 (DA1116), daf-2 (CB1370), daf-16 (CF1038), daf-7 (CB1372). The strain CB1372 was 12 provided by Takao Inoue. All the other strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis 13

Bacterial wavelength, and bacterial stock was diluted to 10 10 , and frozen at -80 o C. NGM plates were 20 seeded with bacteria and used for lifespan assays without further incubation. Drugs or 21
vehicles were added to the bacteria (in addition to being added to NGM) just before seeding. 22 23
Determination of lifespan 24
For determination of C. elegans lifespan, nematodes were age synchronized by bleaching, 25 allowed to hatch and 150-200 young adult worms per condition were transferred to 3-5 35mm 26 culture plates. Worms were transferred to fresh plates every day until progeny production 27 ceased, and every two to three days afterwards, until all worms had died. The number of 28 worms that were alive was determined every day, and dead worms were removed from the 29 plate. Worms were considered dead when no touch-provoked movement was observed. 30
Animals that crawled off the plate, exhibited extruded internal organs or displayed an egg 31 laying defective with subsequent hatching of larvae inside the mother were censored. All 32 lifespan assays were blinded and repeated at least two times. Graph pad Prism 5.0 software 33 was used to calculate mean adult lifespan and to perform statistical analysis of significance 34 using the log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). 35 36
Compound identification and validation 37
Primary Screening: First, we identified well-characterized ageing regulatory pathways 38 (Extended data Table-1 ). Next, we identified drugs and drug-like molecules that are known to 39 target the selected pathways and to extend lifespan in a common ageing model organisms 40 (worm, fly or mice). Some compounds that had been reported to target known ageing 41 pathways and had not yet been experimentally validated as lifespan-extending were also 42
included. This approached culminated in the identification of 11 candidate drugs (Extended 43 data Table-1) . Primary efficacy was confirmed in terms of lifespan in C. elegans. Initial 44 screening of compounds for their effect on lifespan of wild type N2 nematodes were 45 conducted using standardized condition in the presence of antibiotics (200mg/ml 46 streptomycin). Of these 11 drugs and drug-like molecules, only five resulted in reproducible 47 lifespan extension in our lab (Fig. 1) . For those compounds that passed the primary screening, 48
dose-response assays were carried out to establish the ideal dose and maximum effect size. 49 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

For triple drug combinations, we test the 94 combined effects against the sum of the effects of the best pair out of the three drugs. 95 96 97
Mortality 98
We experimentally determined the mortality rate of one of our most powerful interventions, 99 RIF+PSORA+ALLAN, using a large cohort of over 1,000 worms per condition. Dead worms 100
were counted every day until all worms were dead. For RAP+RIF+ALLAN the combined 101 lifespan data was imported to Survcurv for mortality analysis and maximum lifespan 102 comparison 3,4 . We used the Gompertz survival model to determine the initial mortality rate 103 and mortality rate doubling time using the following equation Freshly prepared bacteria (OP50 E. coli) were spotted on 94 cm NGM agar plates on the 115 previous evening and allowed to dry. Synchronized, young adult worms were transferred to 116 fresh plates. For maintaining synchronized populations, FUdR was added to NGM media. 117
After two days of treatment with drug or vehicle adult worms were washed off the plates to 118 15 ml tubes and washed several times until a clear solution, that indicates bacteria is 119 completely removed, was obtained. Clean worm pellets were then frozen and used for RNA 120 extraction. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 121
Germany) following the standard protocol. Afterwards, RNA was quantified photometrically 122
with NanoDrop 2000 and stored at -80 o C until use. The integrity of total RNA was measured 123
by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. For library preparation an amount of 2µg of total RNA per 124 sample was processed using Illumina's RNA Sample Prep Kit following the manufacturer's 125 instruction (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). All single drugs were processed together and 126 multiplexed onto one lane to minimize batch effect. The different drug combinations were 127 processed into two multiplexed lanes. In total, we ran three lanes in parallel with 20 samples 128 in each and we had untreated N2 controls in each lane. Libraries were sequenced using 129
Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in a paired end 130 read approach at a read length of 150 nucleotides. Sequence data was extracted in FastQ 131
format. The RNAseq reads from each sample were mapped to the reference C. elegans 132 transcriptome (WBcel235) with kallisto (v0.43.0) 5 using 100 bootstrap samples and sequence 133 based bias correction. The estimated counts were imported from kallisto to the R environment 134 (v3.3.2) and summarized to gene-level using the tximport package (v1.2.0) 6 . The DESeq2 135 package (v1.14.1) 7 was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all our 136 analysis (correcting for batch effects, when applicable) for a significance threshold α of 0.05 137 after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing through Independent Hypothesis Weighting 138 (IHW package v1.2.0) 8 . The PCA plot were graphed by the pcaExplorer package (v2.0.0) on 139
