Since the first report of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe now presently reported in 177 countries with positive cases crossing 400 thousand and rising. In the current study, prediction is made for highly infected countries by a simple and novel method using only cumulative positive cases reported. The rate of infection per week ( ) coefficient delineated three phases for the current COVID-19 pandemic. All the countries under study have passed Phase 1 and are currently in Phase 2 except for South Korea which is in Phase 3. Early detection with rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
Staying in Phase 2 for longer period would lead to increase in COVID-19 positive cases.
Since the first report of COVID-19 in Wuhan province in the month of December, the virus has spread across the globe through foreign travelers at rapid pace. The SARS-CoV2 is transmitted human to human among close contacts (within about 6 feet) [1] and has mean incubation period of 6.4 days with range of 2.1 to 11.1 days [2] . Asymptotic spread has made detection of virus very difficult. Reverse transcription PCR is widely used for detecting COVID-19 virus which may take few hours and days to obtain results. Observing threat to public health, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be "public health emergency of international concern" on Jan. 30, 2020 [3] and on the 11th of March the disease was declared a global pandemic [4] .
Many prediction models are being proposed for the current pandemic [4] [5] namely SIRD model [7] , GLEaM [8] , Mechanistic-statistical SIR [8] , SEIRUS model [9] . These models are often complex and have multiple parameters. Here we propose a simple prediction method for the current COVID-19 pandemic based on only reported positive COID-19 cases. The current study is aimed to predict future scenario of eight highly infected countries namely Italy, Spain, Germany, France, United States, Iran, South Korea and India.

Initially a smaller number of people are tested due to longer incubation period of virus, (2.1 to 11.1 days with mean of 6.4 days) [2] which leads to low positive cases. This is followed by higher testing samples reporting high number of positive cases.
Phase 2 -In this phase the is above 100 but is decreasing at a certain rate. There is currently popular opinion about flattening the epidemic curve to reduce the load on healthcare sector [13] [14] . The decay of decides the epidemic curve, a fast decay helps in flattening the curve whereas slow decay would lead to steep normal curve. .

US saw its first case on of COVID-19 on Jan 20, 2020. US observed its Phase 1 from Feb 29 to Mar 6 with of 4660. Now currently it is in Phase 2 with a slow decay of . This slow decay would take form of steep normal curve leading to huge increase in and is expected to reach 400,000 positive cases within Apr 3. Immediate actions need to be undertaken to control the disease in United States. WHO said US could be next epicenter for COVID-19 [15] . .

Germany had its first case on January 27 and passed Phase 1 from Feb 29-Mar 6 with lowest (793.10) compared to other countries under study. It is currently in Phase 2 with a gradual decrease in . Germany is predicted to be at the peak of normal curve with highest for next week (Mar 28-Apr 3) and to be in Safe Phase by 10 April. 
France reported its first case on January 24 and passed Phase 1 from Feb 29 to Mar 6. Now it is in Phase 2 and is predicted to have above 100 for next week. .

Iran reported first positive case on February 19. It has passed Phase 1 during Feb 22-Feb 28 and is currently in Phase 2. It is predicted to have above 100 for the next week. 
South Korea passed Phase 1 on Feb 22-Feb 28 with of 7617.86 highest compared to other countries. This high value can be attributed to large scale testing conducted. It is the only country to pass Phase 2 (Feb 29-Mar 6) and now is in Phase 3 for three weeks with both continuously decreasing. .

India reported its first case on January 30. It has passed Phase 1, which was from Feb 29-Mar 6. Now it's in Phase 2, with a fluctuating value. It is predicted to be in Phase 2 for next two weeks. Positive cases reported have history of foreign travel or have come in contact with infected person. Community spread has not yet been reported from India. Coming weeks are crucial for containing COVID-19 pandemic. It is predicted to cross cumulative cases of 3,000

The current method helps to understand the current state of Epidemic and can give fair prediction of Epidemic for upcoming weeks. Rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Initial screening and quarantining people with history of foreign travel helps in further to prevent spread of virus into community. As no vaccine has been developed up till now and control measures are the best option. Quick transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is crucial in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
