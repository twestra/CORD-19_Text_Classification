Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or 28 direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find 44 that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic 45 diversity.
46 47 3 mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural 53 selection, we asked why hasn't the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used 54 experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may 55 actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral 56 mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics.
We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but 58 because it is hard to be both fast and accurate. 59 60 Introduction 61 Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, and mutation rates can have a significant 62 impact on evolutionary rate [1-3]. The intraspecific variability in mutation rate in many viruses 63 and bacteria indicates that mutation rates have been optimized by natural selection [4-13].
Given that most mutations are deleterious, the burden of excess mutational load will select 65 against strains with abnormally high mutation rates [14][15][16][17]. This principle led to Sturtevant to 66 ask, "Why does the mutation rate not evolve to zero?" [18,19].
A large body of theoretical and experimental work suggests that the selective pressure for 69 higher mutation rates is due to either the physicochemical cost of maintaining a lower one or a 70 selective advantage from an increased supply of beneficial mutations [20-23]. Many have 71 argued for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates in pathogenic microbes, which often exist 72 in dynamic environments and are subject to host immune pressure [7,24,25]. However, direct 73 selection of a variant with a higher mutation rate will only occur if it has been advantageous in 74 the past, and in many cases, it has been difficult to separate the causes of a higher mutation 75 rate from its consequences [19,26].

While 78 interspecific mutation rates range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 errors per nucleotide copied [4], studies of 79 antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several fold within a 80 species [27]. The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on 81 mutation rates and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9,28-31]. Given the short 82 generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher 83 fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32,33]. However, the observed 84 attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of 85 high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus' evolution in the 86 face of varying intrahost environments [7,10,34-38]. This concept is central to viral quasispecies 87 theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24,25].
Here, we define the selective forces that shape viral mutation rates by studying an antimutator 90 variant. The 3D G64S mutant of poliovirus was selected after serial passage in ribavirin, an RNA 91 virus mutagen. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 3D) of this variant contains a 92 single glycine to serine substitution [5-7]. The basal mutation rate of 3D G64S is reported to be 93 ~20-30% that of wild type virus (WT). While the 3D G64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus 94 receptor transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this 95 phenotype is not clear [7,36]. Biochemical assays of 3D G64S suggest a physicochemical cost of 96 high fidelity, but as in other systems, its contribution to overall fitness remains unquantified 97 [6,19,39].

Results
We measured the relative fitness of 3D G64S by direct competition over serial passage by RT-101 qPCR (Fig. 1A) . Here, the fitness of 3D G64S is 0.78 ± 0.01 (n=3 replicates) relative to WT. This is 102 a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64 th percentile in a dataset of 8970 fitness values 103 .

104 hour infection cycle, and 6 passages; Fig. 1B ). We also measured the relative growth properties 105 of WT and 3D G64S using a plaque size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and 106 spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40][41][42]. The distribution of clonal 107 plaque sizes was significantly different (p<0.005, unpaired t-test with Welch correction, n=272 108 WT and n=220 3D G64S plaques), and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3D G64S (Fig.   109 1C). In contrast to prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3D G64S by 110 one step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and 111 larger numbers of replicates (Fig. 1D ). This replication defect was not specific to HeLa, as we 112 observed a similar lag for 3D G64S in a 3T3 cell line that we derived from mouse embryonic 113 fibroblasts from poliovirus receptor transgenic mice (PVR-3T3, Fig. 1E ). These data 114 demonstrate that the fitness defect of 3D G64S is largely attributable to its slower replicative 115 kinetics and is consistent with biochemical assays on purified RdRp [6,39].
The reduced mutation rate and replicative fitness of 3D G64S suggest a trade-off between speed 118 and fidelity in RNA virus replication. Here, the fitness gain from increased replicative speed is 119 offset by a reduction in fitness due to increased mutational load. We derived a quantitative 120 model of this trade-off (see SI Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness (Fig. 1F ) and 121 mutation rate (Fig. 1G, Table S1 ) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, 122 ribavirin [43]. Wild type and 3D G64S had equal fitness at approximately 150µM ribavirin. Based 123 on these data, our model indicates that WT incurs a fitness cost of 0.137 from mutational load 124 alone. Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would 125 presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037.
If viral RdRp are constrained by a speed-fidelity trade-off, selection for increased replicative 128 speed (r-selection) will increase mutation rate. We subjected the 3D G64S-1nt point mutant
6 (A6176G) to r-selection over serial passage by infecting cells at low multiplicity and harvesting 130 progeny at 4.5 hours (mid-exponential phase of replication). The 3D G64S point mutant reverted to 131 WT within 15 passages in 5 independent lineages ( Fig. 2A) . We only observed partial reversion 132 at passage 15 in a subset of 24-hour control lineages, in which virus populations underwent 133 twice as many cellular infection cycles per passage and experienced reduced r-selection. We 134 next asked whether r-selection would lead to genetic compensation of the fidelity phenotype in 135 3D G64S-3nt , which has all three positions in the codon mutated to minimize reversion. After 50 136 passages of r-selection, we identified fixed and polymorphic single nucleotide variants (SNV) by 137 next generation sequencing of all r-selected and control (24 hour passage) populations of 138 3D G64S and WT (Fig. 2B ).
Unbiased hierarchical clustering of SNV by type and frequency indicates that the viruses 141 explored distinct mutational pathways in adapting to either r-selective or control passaging 142 regimes. Within the r-selected group, WT and 3D G64S lineages clustered together and we noted 143 a larger number of SNV within the coding region for the RdRp across the five 3D G64S populations.
Not surprisingly, we found that a number of distinct SNV increased viral fitness when introduced 145 into the ancestral WT backbone. For example, the WT-VP4 S22G had a fitness of 1.53, and its 146 presence in all r-selected and control lineages suggests that it mediates adaptation to HeLa 147 cells. In contrast, a mutation in the viral helicase found only in r-selected populations, 2C V127L 148 (fitness 1.52-1.67 in WT and 1.11 ± 0.02 in 3D G64S ), would be more likely to have a general 149 effect on replicative speed.
To identify compensatory mutations, we focused our subsequent analysis on nonsynonymous 152 mutations in the RdRp that were found predominantly in r-selected populations, shared among 153 multiple lineages, and more frequent in 3D G64S than in WT. Two mutations -U6261C/3D I92T and 7 the I92T mutation may have arisen first. The 3D I92T mutation, which was found in both r-selected 156 WT (3/5) and 3D G64S (5/5) lineages, did not change either fitness or mutation rate appreciably in 157 the 3D G64S background ( Fig. 2C and 2D ). The r-selected K276R substitution, which was found in 158 3D G64S lineages (4/5) and not in WT populations, decreased overall fitness in both WT (0.92 ± 159 0.03, p=0.0031 vs. WT, t-test) and 3D G64S (0.55 ± 0.03, p=0.005 vs. 3D G64S , t-test) . It had no 160 detectable effect on mutation rate in either background. The G64S/I92T/K276R triple mutant 161 had a significant increase in fitness (0.7637, p=0.0012 vs. 3D G64S , t-test) and mutation rate (8.71 162 x 10 -6 s/n/r, p=0.0120 vs. 3D G64S , t-test) compared to 3D G64S and each double mutant. Therefore, 163 direct selection for replicative speed caused an increase in the poliovirus mutation rate with sign 164 epistasis among the G64S, I92T, and K276R in the RdRp.
To gain mechanistic insight into the interactions among these three mutations, we analyzed the 167 kinetics of single-base incorporation and misincorporation by purified RdRp. The 3D G64S ; I92T 168 RdRp exhibits an assembly defect relative to 3D I92T when incubated with purified primer-169 template and ATP (Fig. 2E and [6] ). The K276R mutation partially compensates for this 
The adaptability of WT and high fidelity viruses have generally been compared using assays 177 that measure the acquisition of drug resistance, the reversion of an attenuating point mutation, 178 or escape from microRNA in a limited number of replication cycles [5] [6] [7] 34, 36] . In these 179 experiments, mutations come at little cost, and the assays essentially quantify the beneficial 180 mutation rate. To capture better the impact of both deleterious and beneficial mutations on 8 adaptability, we measured the fitness gain of WT and 3D G64S over twenty passages in HeLa.
While our WT strain is "culture-adapted," we found that it was far from a fitness peak; both WT 183 and 3D G64S increased their fitness ten-fold in approximately 40 cellular infection cycles (20 184 passages, Fig. 3A, Fig. S2 ). The difference in the rate of fitness gain between WT and 3D G64S 185 lineages was small but statistically significant (0.025 per passage, WT > 3D G64S ; mixed linear 186 effects model, p=0.0129).
We examined adaptation to a completely distinct environment by repeating the experiment on 189 our PVR-3T3 cell line [44, 45] . In this alternative species and cell type, we actually observed 190 greater fitness gain in the high fidelity 3D G64S variant relative to WT (0.121 per passage; mixed 191 linear effects model, p=0.0013). The larger fitness gain in 3T3 cells may reflect a larger supply 192 of beneficial, compensatory mutations given the lower baseline fitness of 3D G64S in these cells.
These data suggest that, despite its two-fold reduction in mutation rate, 3D G64S is not mutation 194 limited, and that any adaptive benefit of a higher mutation rate is countered by the fitness cost of 195 increased mutational load (see Fig. 1F and 1G and associated model above).
We next compared the phenotype of WT and 3D G64S viruses in vivo, where the ability to 198 generate genetic diversity may allow a virus to escape host immune restriction and to replicate 199 better in a range of environments. Importantly, the available data have suggested that the 200 attenuation of 3D G64S and other high fidelity variants in experimental models is attributable to 201 differences in the genetic diversity of the infecting population [7] . We therefore used next 202 generation sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of 5 replicate stocks each of WT and 203 3D G64S . Using an internally benchmarked analysis pipeline that dramatically reduces false 204 positive variant calls (see [46] and Methods), we identified no variants at greater than 0.1% 205 frequency. Therefore, we can exclude any significant differences in standing genetic diversity 206 between our WT and 3D G64S populations. Even at extremely high multiplicities of infection, 9 variants present at <0.1% are unlikely to complement each other or to cooperate reproducibly in 208 a cellular context or in vivo [47] .
The absence of mutational diversity in our replicate WT and 3D G64S stocks is important, as 211 poliovirus populations are subject to stringent bottleneck events, which further restrict intrahost 212 diversity [48] [49] [50] . Work with barcoded RNA viruses suggests that the serial bottlenecks between 213 the infecting population and the terminal population colonizing the central nervous system 214 (CNS) are quite stringent [51, 52] , and we used published data to quantify the aggregate 215 bottleneck size encountered by poliovirus in transgenic mice [45, 48, 49] . Maximum likelihood 216 optimization of a simple probabilistic model estimated an aggregate bottleneck size of 2.67 217 between the inoculum and the CNS (Fig. 4A , SI Model 2). Therefore, the population that causes 218 eventual disease in these mice is derived from no more than 2-3 viruses in the infecting 219 population. In the setting of tight bottlenecks, many mutations will increase in frequency due to 220 genetic drift as opposed to positive selection.
We infected groups of PVR mice intramuscularly with both WT and 3D G64S populations. Both 223 viruses were able to access the CNS efficiently through this route over a range of doses (Fig. 
4B, Table S2 ), but there was a clear delay in the 3D G64S group (p=0.0239, p<0.001, p<0.001 for 225 10 5 , 10 6 , 10 7 pfu inocula, respectively). This lag persisted even when we increased the number 226 of rare, but undetectable, variants in the inoculum by infecting with doses 20-fold higher than the 227 LD 50 of 3D G64S (Table S3 ). Both viruses spread to the CNS and replicated to high titers after 228 intravenous inoculation, although WT titers in the brain and spinal cord were marginally higher 229 at 5 days post infection ( Figure 4C , p=0.0012 for brain and p=0.0221 for spinal cord, Mann 230 Whitney U test). Here too, WT mice generally developed severe morbidity more rapidly than 231 those infected with 3D G64S . We characterized the mutations present in the CNS populations of 10 were rare, none were shared among mice, and there was an excess of synonymous or 234 noncoding variants relative to nonsynonymous ones. These data are consistent with random 235 sampling of the infecting population as opposed to positive selection.
We also examined the impact of the r-selected mutations on virulence. The 2C V127L mutation, 238 which conferred a fitness of 1.11 in the 3D G64S background and does not appear to affect fidelity 239 ( Fig. S3) , restored virulence to nearly WT levels (p=0.0012, log rank test, compare 3D G64S to 240 3D G64S ;2C V127L in Fig. 4E ). In contrast, the triple mutant, 3D G64S;I92T;K276R , which replicates with a 241 wild type mutation rate and a marginally increased fitness of 0.7637, was only slightly more 242 virulent than the high fidelity variant 3D G64S (p=0.0411, log rank test, compare 3D G64S to 243 3D G64S;I92T;K276R in Fig. 4F ). Therefore, restoration of replicative speed restored virulence in 244 3D G64S , but compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not.
We used a well-studied antimutator variant of poliovirus to identify the selective forces that 248 optimize a pathogen's mutation rate. Using three different assays, we identified a significant 249 fitness cost to higher fidelity and directly link this cost to viral replication kinetics. Our 250 quantitative model of the speed-fidelity trade-off suggests that selection for replicative speed 251 has pushed viral mutation rates to a level that imposes a significant fitness cost at baseline due 252 to lethal or highly deleterious mutations. Consistent with the trade-off model, direct selection for 253 increased replicative speed led to indirect selection of polymerases with higher mutation rates.
The genetic interactions are quite strong as the two compensatory mutations exhibited 255 reciprocal sign epistasis. The speed-fidelity trade-off in the poliovirus RdRp appears to be a 256 generalizable phenomenon, as compensatory mutations that increased the replicative speed of 257 the 3D K359H antimutator also increased its mutation rate (Table S4) . Given the structural 258 similarity among viral RdRp, the polymerases of other RNA viruses are likely to be subject to the 11 same speed-fidelity trade-off, and we predict that the molecular mechanisms governing 260 polymerase kinetics and mutation rate will be similar.
Trade-offs are essentially constraints that force one parameter to change with another. In this 263 case, viral mutation rate changes with replicative speed [53] . Similar trade-offs are central to the 264 kinetic proofreading hypothesis, which posits a close relationship between the error rates of 265 biosynthetic processes and the kinetics of their component reactions [54] . Interestingly, studies 266 of DNA replication and protein translation suggest that these systems optimize speed over 267 accuracy, so long as the error rates are within a tolerable range [55, 56] . We find a similar 268 phenomenon in viral RdRp, where the WT generates an extraordinary amount of mutational 269 load, largely because of the benefit in replicative speed.
Failure to consider evolutionary trade-offs can lead to teleological errors, in which the 272 consequences of a process (e.g. increased genetic diversity) are misinterpreted as a cause (e.g.
direct selection for a higher mutation rate [19, 23, 26] ). Similarly, we find that the widely accepted 274 link between within host genetic diversity and virulence is confounded by the fact that faster 275 replicating viruses are both more virulent and have higher mutation rates. The high mutation 276 rates of RNA viruses and the highly deleterious fitness effects of mutations ensure that most 277 genetic diversity is extremely rare and unlikely to be consistently maintained in the face of 278 intrahost and interhost bottlenecks [52]. We do not dispute that virus populations will harbor 279 minority variants, that a subset of these mutations may be adaptive or beneficial to the virus, 280 and that some may be virulence determinants. However, the observation of genetic diversity is 281 not in and of itself evidence that selection has optimized mutation rates for the future benefit of 282 novel mutations. Indeed, our data show little adaptive benefit to a marginally increased mutation 283 rate and identify no plausible mechanism whereby the observed increase in rare genetic 284 diversity can influence pathogenesis. We suspect that RNA viruses are subject to other trade-12 offs of evolutionary significance, perhaps between polymerase speed and recombination rate or 286 recombination rate and polymerase fidelity. Here too, it will be important to define the selective 287 forces at play, thereby separating the causes from the consequences. 
The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations were verified by 326 Sanger sequencing of the amplified insert, and in some cases the entire genome.
In vitro transcription, transfection, and viral stocks 329 Viral RNA was generated by in vitro transcription of the corresponding plasmid clone using T7 330 RNA polymerase, and virus was recovered following RNA transfection of HeLa. For 331 transfections, 2.6 x 10 5 HeLa were plated per well in a 12 well plate the day prior. One The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For all stocks, cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and the supernatants 338 clarified by centrifugation a 1400 x g for 4 minutes. These supernatants were stored at minus 339 80˚C in aliquots to limit the number of subsequent freeze-thaw cycles.
Competition assay for viral fitness 342 Competition assays were performed essentially as described in [17, 42] . For the experiment in 
Three replicate wells were infected with each pair of viruses in 250µl for one hour with 346 occasional rocking. After one hour, the inoculum was removed and 1ml fresh media applied.
Passage 1 virus was harvested after an additional 7 hours (8 hours since infection). The titer of 348 the passage 1 virus was used to calculate the dilution factor necessary to maintain an MOI of 349 0.1 for the subsequent 5 passages. RNA was harvested from each passage using Trizol 350 (Ambion 15596026). Random hexamers were used to prime cDNA synthesis with 1/10 of the 351 RNA. Each cDNA was analyzed by real time PCR using three different primer and/or probe sets 352 with duplicate PCR reactions for each sample/primer set. The first set, COM2F 5' 353 CATGGCAGCCCCGGAACAGG 3' and COM2R 5' TGTGATGGATCCGGGGGTAGCG 3', was 354 used to quantify total viral genomic RNA in a SYBR green reaction (Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix, Thermo 4368708). Two custom TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) were used to 356 quantify the number of WT and 3D G64S genomes. Duplicate wells were averaged, and relative 357 amounts of WT and 3D G64S RNA were determined by normalizing the cycle thresholds for each 358 these probes to those of the COM primer set (ΔCt = Ct Virus -Ct COM ). The normalized values for 359 virus passages 1-6 were then compared to passage 0 to obtain a ratio relative to P0 (ΔΔCt = 360 ΔCt PX -ΔCt P0 ). This relative Ct value was converted to reflect the fold change in the ratio (Δratio = The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For all other competition assays (Fig. 3) , we compared the experimental virus (e.g. WT P4, 367 3D G64S P8 etc.) to a tagged WT reference (Tag8). We plated 2.6 x 10 5 cells per well (either HeLa 368 or PVR 3T3) in 12 well plates. Infections were performed at an MOI of 0.05 in 250µl complete 369 media for 1 hour. After an hour, the media were aspirated and fresh 1ml growth media applied.

The day prior to infection, 4 x 10 5 HeLa cells were plated in 12 well plates with 45 wells per virus 391 (9 time points and 5 replicates per time point). Cells were infected at an MOI of 1 in 150µl 392 volume and incubated on ice for 1 hour with occasional rocking. At one hour, the inocula were 393 aspirated, each well was washed twice with ice cold PBS, and 1ml of fresh, pre-warmed growth 394 media were applied to all wells. One set of 5 wells was immediately frozen as the t=0h time 395 point. All other plates were returned to the incubator, and a set of 5 wells was removed and 396 frozen at t=1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 7 hours. All samples were titered by TCID 50 . The growth 397 curve on PVR-3T3 cells was performed using a similar protocol, except that 5 x 10 5 cells were 398 plated the day prior and the time points were t=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours. 
The lysed cells and media were harvested following three complete freeze-thaw cycles and 412 transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The empty wells were rinsed with 300µl of complete 413 growth media and combined with the initial 200µl lysate. This 500µl lysate was clarified by 414 centrifugation at 1400 x g for 4 minutes.

After one 442 hour, the inoculum was aspirated, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 2ml of fresh 443 growth media applied. For the first 15 passages, WT and 3D G64S viruses were harvested at 4 444 and 4.5 hours, respectively. For passages 16-50, WT and 3D G64S viruses were harvested at 3.5 445 and 4 hours, respectively. Control populations were infected in the same manner except that 446 viruses were harvested at 24 hours post infection. There were (5) r-selected WT lineages, (5) r-447 selected 3D G64S lineages, (5) control WT lineages, and (5) control 3D G64S lineages. Viruses were 448 titered at every 5 th passage to maintain an MOI of approximately 0.5.
The 3D K359R RdRp has slower polymerization kinetics and higher fidelity relative to WT [64] . The
3D K359H RdRp has similar characteristics (see Table S4 ). HeLa cells were transfected by 453 electroporation with viral RNA transcript, added to HeLa cell monolayers and incubated at 37°C.
After two days the media were passaged onto a separate monolayer of HeLa cells. Upon 455 cytopathic effect, viruses were harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, cell debris was 456 removed by centrifugation, and viral supernatants were titrated. In this time frame, the titer 457 increased approximately 40-fold (from 5.1 x 10 5 pfu/mL to 2.1 x 10 7 ).

The premise of the speed-fidelity tradeoff is that the outcome of competition between two viral 843 strains will be determined by two opposing forces -the speed with which the genome can be 844 replicated and the error rate of replication. The faster genome replication happens, the more 845 errors that occur and the greater the mutational load. In this scenario an optimal competitive 846 fitness will be achieved exactly where the increase in fitness is counterbalanced by decrease in 847 fitness from excess mutational load. Here we present a simple mathematical model to 848 demonstrate this tradeoff, and fit the model to the experimental data.
We start with the classical estimation by Haldane (1937) Where c a and c b are the genome replication rates and U a and U b are the deleterious genomic 867 mutation rates per genome per generation for strains a and b, respectively.
To understand the effect of a mutagen on the relative fitness of one strain to another, we add a 870 mutation rate multiplier (mu external, σ), which multiplicatively modifies the baseline mutation 871 rate. We constrain σ to take values greater than one. The G64S mutation has two effects (see also Fig. 1F ). The mutation results in an increase in 892 fidelity, represented as a downward shift in the line. The mutation also results in relative 893 resistance to ribavirin, which manifests as a decreased slope. Both of these need to be included 894 to estimate the mutational load experienced by WT and the 3D G64S mutant replicating in the 895 presence of increasing mutagen. Linear regression fit to both the WT and 3D G64S mutation rate 896 produce a good fit (r 2 of .73 and .76 respectively) that is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001 897 for both). The fit of the linear regression was used to estimate the mutation rate for WT and 898 3D G64S in the absence of ribavirin (1.34 x 10 -5 s/n/r and 3.43 x10 -6 s/n/r respectively) and at the 899 point of equilibrium.
We solved for the two unknown variables: (i) n, the number of deleterious sites in the genome, 902 and (ii) c, the fitness cost of the G64S mutation in the absence of mutational load, which is 903 relative to the wild type (arbitrarily set to 1). Because there are two unknown variables, we need 904 two equations to solve for them. We use the measured relative fitness in the absence of ribavirin 905 and the ribavirin concentration where the relative fitness is expected to be 1 (150µM, see Fig. 
1E). We used the mutation rates estimated for each strain and ribavirin concentration 907 (µstrain,conc). At 0µM ribavirin, the fitness of 3D G64S relative to WT was measured as 0.67, 908 which gives us our first equation:

We developed the following model to measure the effective bottleneck that restricts poliovirus 931 populations between the site of inoculation and the central nervous system. We applied a 932 simple probabilistic model to data described in [48] . In this study, 27 mice were infected with 2 x 933 10 7 PFU of poliovirus (2-5 fold higher than the LD 50 in this particular mouse model). The inocula 934 consisted of 4 subpopulations at equal concentrations, each tagged with a neutral sequence bar 935 code. In separate experiments, the authors showed that all 4 bar codes were present at the site 936 of infection and that all four bar codes were capable of replicating simultaneously in the brain.
Rarely were all 4 bar codes present in the brain following infection, suggesting that the 938 populations were subject to within host bottlenecks. Similar results were observed for IV and IP 939 routes of infection. In fact, IM appeared to be the least stringent mode of infection. To estimate 940 the bottleneck between the site of infection and the brain, we modeled the infection process as 941 a random sampling event. This assumption was justified as: (i) there is no evidence that a 942 "jackpot" mutation is needed to enter the central nervous system. (ii) the bar codes were 943 selectively neutral. (iii) all bar codes were equally likely to be present in the brain.
The probability of a sample size of ! containing ! unique types given there are ! total unique 946 types available (all present at equal frequency) derives from discrete probability theory and is 947 given by 
In terms of the above experimental design, we are interested in the probability a subset of size ! 952 containing 1,2,3, or 4 barcodes (!) given 4 possible barcodes (!).
Maximum likelihood optimization revealed that a bottleneck of 4 PFU best matched the data. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We then searched for the ! that maximized 973 the sum of the log of this likelihood, which was calculated for each mouse. We found that a ! of 974 2.44 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.39 -3.82) best fit the data. The mean of a zero-975 truncated Poisson is given by
. Therefore the mean bottleneck size is 2.67.

We also checked the fit by asking how the output of the simulations matched the actual 986 experimental data (e.g. how often did we see 9 mice with 1 bar code, 10 with 2, 7 with 3, and 1 987 with 4).
In contrast, we did not replicate the data once in 10,000 simulations with a bottleneck of 10.

GTP and a 25-fold excess of unlabeled trap RNA are then added after an incubation period (Δt). Excess of RNA trap ensures that if the polymerase dissociates from primer-template it is taken up by the trap and cannot re-assemble. (B) Kpol and Kd for GMP misincorporation.

Mutagen sensitivity of 2C-V127L variants. HeLa were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with the indicated viruses in presence of various concentrations of ribavirin. After 24 hours, titers of mock and ribavirin-treated populations were determined by TCID50 and those of ribavirin-treated populations were normalized to mock-treated controls (mean of 5 measurements per virus). Shown are the changes in titer (y-axis, mean, 5 replicates) for each virus at each drug concentration (x-axis). A greater reduction in titer (more negative number) indicates higher mutagen sensitivity and suggests a higher baseline mutation rate.
