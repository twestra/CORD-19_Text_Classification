Background: Antiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking.
Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19.
Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced All rights reserved.

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world, with outbreaks in more than 200 countries and regions [ 1 , 2 ] . The pathogenic organism responsible was identified and termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV), belonging to the same family of viruses responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [ 3 ] . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern and characterized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. As of March 31 st , 2020, 750,890 confirmed cases and 36,405 death cases have been documented globally [ 2 ] . Despite its rapid global spread, little is known about the pathogenesis of the virus or its infectious host. Even worse, no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs have demonstrated efficacy in prevention or treatment of COVID-19, which has led to great difficulty in controlling the epidemic and decreasing the mortality rate inhibitor, usually combined with ritonavir to inhibit cytochrome P450 in order to increase the half-life of lopinavir [ 6 ] . In the past 10 years, LPV/r has been proven to have good efficacy and limited side effects for treating HIV-1 [7] .
Lopinavir was reported to have antiviral activity against MERS-CoV in Vero cells (concentration causing a 50% reduction in replication (EC50) = 8 µM) [ 8 ] .
Additionally, despite lacking a valid estimate of efficacy, the combination of LPV/r has been associated with significantly fewer adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome or death) in 41 patients with SARS compared with ribavirin alone in 111 historical controls (2.4% versus 28.8%, P= 0.001) in the 21 days after the onset of symptoms [ 9 ] . Thus, based on in vitro testing and previous clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy against other coronaviruses, LPV/r was regarded as an option for treating COVID-19.
Arbidol is a haemagglutinin inhibitor that can effectively block the fusion of influenza virus with its host cell. In addition, it can also induce the immune system to produce endogenous interferon against virus replication, enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages, and activate natural killer cells.
[ 1 0 , 1 1 ] . Arbidol was reported to be effective against all strains of influenza viruses (A, B, C), especially influenza A viruses (H1N1, H2N2, H3N3), and to be safe with few side effects [ 1 2 ] . Arbidol was also shown to have direct antiviral effects by inhibiting the replication of SARS virus in vitro [ 1 3 ] .
Despite the above preliminary evidence, the actual clinical efficacy of LPV/r or arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Therefore, we were urgently in All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We ultimately recruited 86 patients, who were randomly assigned (2:2:1) into 3 groups as follows: In group A (LPV/r group), 34 patients were administered lopinavir (200mg) boosted by ritonavir (50mg) (orally administed, twice daily, 500 mg, each time for 7-14 days). In group B (arbidol group), 35 patients were given arbidol (100mg) (orally administed, 200mg three times daily for 7-14 days). In group C (control group), 17 patients were not given any antiviral therapy. All three groups were followed for up to 21 days. All three groups were treated with supportive care and effective oxygen therapy if in need. 5 Antiviral treatment was discontinued for patients who 1) had been treated for more than 7 days and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in two consecutive tests separated by more than 24 hours, or 2) were discharged from hospital, or 3) had intolerable side effects.
All participants met the following inclusion criteria: 1) age between 18 and 80 years; 2) SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab; 3) mild clinical status, defined as having mild clinical symptoms but no signs of pneumonia on imaging or moderate clinical status, defined as having fever, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia on imaging [5]; 4) the following lab findings: creatinine ≤ 110μmol/L, creatinine clearance rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 × ULN, and total bilirubin (TBIL) ≤ 2 × ULN; 5) willingness to participate in the study and provide informed consent.

Before initiation of the trial, the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital (Approval No. 202002136) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04252885). The ethics committee agreed to set up the control group owing to a lack of reliable evidence about the benefit of present antiviral regimens for treating COVID-19. The trial was also performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization's Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from all screened patients after they fully understood the meaning of the trial and the potential risks involved.

The laboratory parameters of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) and creatinine were normal when patients started the antiviral treatment. Other laboratory parameters including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein level and procalcitonin level did not show significant differences between the three groups (P >0.05).
During the study period, six patients used gamma globulin (10 g, once a day, for 2-3 days),12 used glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 40 mg, once a day, for 3-5 days) and 54 received oxygen supply therapy.

At days 7 and 14 of follow-up, 6 (46.2%) and 10 (76.9%) patients had improvements in chest CT imaging. At the follow-up endpoint of day 21, 12 patients had been discharged from hospital and only one case was still hospitalized. No deaths occurred.
Several clinical studies have reported the treatment of a large number of COVID-19 patients with antiviral and antibiotic therapy [15] [16] [17] . However, no specific medication has proven effective for suppressing or eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection or for reducing complications and mortality. There are several ongoing clinical drug trials registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry [15, 18] . Although the epidemic within China is now largely under control, epidemics in other countries are becoming increasingly severe [2] .
Therefore, it is extremely important to find specific anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs and learn from the experience of Chinese health providers.
Our study was designed to be an empirical exploration intended to recruit 125 adult patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19; however, only 86 patients were involved in this study for the reasons previously mentioned.
Through randomization, 34 patients were assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol, and 17 to no antiviral medication as control. The results showed that LPV/r and arbidol did not shorten the time of positive-to-negative conversion of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Despite the small sample size, our study also suggests that monotherapy of LPV/r or arbidol might not improve the clinical outcome in treating with mild/moderate COVID-19.
During the study period, a total of 13 (15.1%) patients progressed to severe/critical clinical status including 8 receiving LPV/r, 3 receiving arbidol and 2 in the control group, which indicates that disease condition could still worsen even after hospitalization, and thus urgently demands rigorous observation of illness and care. Fortunately, by the endpoint of this study twelve patients had been discharged from hospital after recovery, and only one patient remained hospitalized, albeit with significant clinical improvement. This gives us confidence that even in the absence of specific antiviral drugs, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in severe/critical clinical status can still recover after comprehensive treatment.
Our study is not without its limitations. First, we recognize that our sample size was small. Second, the study did not enroll severely or critically ill patients, or patients at increased risk of poor outcome with many comorbidities and was conducted in only one center. Third, the study was not completely blinded, possibly influencing the outcome to some extent. We will continue to All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Nevertheless, as a prospective randomized, controlled trial, this study could still provide meaningful suggestions for proper application of LPV/r and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19.
In conclusion, our study found that LPV/r or arbidol monotherapy presents little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 beyond symptomatic and supportive care, causing instead more adverse events. Further work is needed to confirm these results. Chen, Wenxin Hong and Guangming Xiao contributed to conducting the study and collecting data.
