25 26 27 INTRODUCTION: Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide 28 actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies 29 were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how 30 timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: 31 To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease 32 outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the 33 recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey 34 literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or 35 epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 36 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, 37 reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were 38 identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R 0 (basic reproductive number) 39 and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-40 Barr√© Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most 41 studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific 42 studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most 43 common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 44 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent 45 in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty 46 percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 47 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail 48 allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the 49 epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV 50 predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 51 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 52 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in 53 these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for 54 improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to 55 improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and 56 pandemics.
57 58 Author summary: Researchers published many studies which sought to predict and forecast 59 important features of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and their spread during the 2016-2017 ZIKV
60 pandemic. We conducted a comprehensive review of such ZIKV prediction studies and 61 evaluated their aims, the data sources they used, which methods were used, how timely they 62 were published, and whether they provided sufficient information to be used or reproduced by 63 others. Of the 73 studies evaluated, we found that the accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, 64 and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there 65 is substantial room for improvement. We identified that the release of study findings before 66 formal journal publication ('pre-prints') increased the timeliness of Zika prediction studies, but
111 of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, 112 and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction 113 estimates. The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, 114 such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these 115 publications. 127 In MEDLINE we performed a highly sensitive search solely using the term "Zika". A 128 complementary search in EMBASE used a more specific ontology: "Zika AND (forecasting OR 129 prediction OR model OR modeling OR modelling OR risk OR estimating OR dynamics) NOT 130 mouse". Both database searches were limited to articles published as of March 1, 2017, and the 131 MEDLINE searching was restricted to those publications released between February 1, 2016 and 132 March 1, 2017. We complemented these database search results with 'grey literature', This article is a US Government work.

137 Screening and eligibility determination:
138 139 Using a two-reviewer system (with consensus for disagreements and conferral with a 3 rd party 140 adjudicator if a consensus was unable to be reached), all articles identified through the above 141 literature search were screened by reviewing the title and abstract to remove all articles that 142 clearly did not meet the eligibility criteria (below). The full text of the remaining articles was 143 reviewed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer if a consensus was not reached by the first 144 two reviewers. Eligibility was based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:

This finding reflects not only the availability but also 268 the importance of such data. Case count data in particular are often hard to access but critical 269 to many modeling approaches. Rapid sharing of case count data during international public 270 health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human 271 mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and 272 forecasting efforts (109). Our review also identified several relatively underused data streams.
273 First, socioeconomic and behavioral data were conspicuously absent. The lack of behavioral 274 components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease 275 dynamics. Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such social-media and internet 276 search-engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this 277 systematic review. The limited use of internet 'big data' in the models suggests that either 278 these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be 279 developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be 280 more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become 281 clearer (117).
283 Genomic data were absent from these published models. During the pandemic, sequencing 284 platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure 285 development (118), but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated 286 into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

In the future, as new methods are 296 developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely 297 become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.
299 Our systematic review did not delve deeply into modeling approaches, but did identify a 300 preponderance of deterministic as opposed to stochastic models. Both categories of models 301 have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in 302 addition to data availability (123). Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but 303 they do have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as 304 underestimating uncertainty (124). Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where 305 uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches.
306 Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a 307 context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for 308 improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies completely reporting uncertainty. This article is a US Government work.

To the extent permissible with ethical and privacy constraints, publishing the 326 aggregated data used to fit and validate models is critical. Not only would sharing data support 327 full reproducibility, but sharing would also enable other researchers to use data in their own 328 complementary modeling efforts. Modelers could therefore help answer calls for increased 329 data sharing during public health emergencies (103, 109, 130) . Exploring how data can be This article is a US Government work.

Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior 347 to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and 348 journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication.
349 An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar 350 publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here 351 (3.4% versus 30%) (131). This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which This article is a US Government work.

Addressing 376 these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure that 377 forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics and 378 pandemics.
