Positive-sense RNA viruses hijack intracellular membranes that provide niches for viral RNA 23 synthesis and a platform for interactions with host proteins. However, little is known about host 24 factors at the interface between replicase complexes and the host cytoplasm. We engineered a 25 biotin ligase into a coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC) and identified >500 26 host proteins constituting the RTC microenvironment. siRNA-silencing of each host factor demonstrated importance of vesicular trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent 28 and autophagy-related processes, and translation initiation factors. Notably, detection of 29 translation initiation factors at the RTC was instrumental to visualize and demonstrate active 30 translation proximal to replication complexes of several coronaviruses. 31
Collectively, we establish a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors 32 of unprecedented breadth. Our data may serve as a paradigm for other positive-strand RNA 33 viruses and provide a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of critical virus-host 34 interactions that represent targets for therapeutic intervention.
Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate at membranous structures that accommodate the viral 37 replication complex and facilitate RNA synthesis in the cytosol of infected host cells (1-5). 38
Rewiring host endomembranes is hypothesized to provide a privileged microenvironment 39 physically separated from the cytosol, thereby ensuring adequate concentrations of 40 macromolecules for viral RNA synthesis, preventing recognition of replication intermediates 41 such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by cytosolic innate immune receptors (6, 7), and 42 providing a platform that facilitates molecular interactions with host cell proteins. 43
Ultrastructural studies have reported the origin, nature, and extent of membrane modifications 44 induced by coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae), which materialize as an 45 ER-derived network of interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted 46 membranes (CM) in perinuclear regions of infected cells to which the viral 47 replication/transcription complex (RTC) is anchored (4, 8, 9). The RTC is generated by 48 translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-49 proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed 50 non-structural proteins (nsps) 1-16. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not 51 considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell 52 translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (10-12). Although it has not yet been 53 formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor 54 multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, 55 exo-and endonuclease, and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (13-18). Many of these functions 56 have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-57 host interactions (19-23). In most cases phenotypes were described via loss-of-function 58 mutagenesis, however, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC 59 components with host cell factors remain largely unknown. 60 .

Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to 63 other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins 64 required for replication (29, 30). Some of these proteins were described in the context of 65 distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation 66 (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified 67 by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a 68 small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment. 69
To capture the full breadth of host cell proteins and cellular pathways that are spatially 70 associated with viral RTCs, we employed a proximity-based labeling approach involving a 71 promiscuous E. coli-derived biotin ligase (BirAR118G). BirAR118G biotinylates proximal (<10 72 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and 73 hence, does not rely on high affinity protein-protein interactions, but is able to permanently tag 74 transient interactions (31). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing 75 conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of 76 captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirAR118G as an integral 77 component of the RTC we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular 78 microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these 79 factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus 80 trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and 81 translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity 82 to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during 83 coronavirus replication. Collectively, the determination of the coronavirus RTC-associated 84 microenvironment provides a functional and spatial link between conserved host cell processes 85 .

This strategy was recently employed by 93 Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 (34). MHV-BirAR118G-94 nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirAR118G, while a deleted cleavage site 95
between BirAR118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein (Fig.  96   1a) . 97 MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 replicated to comparable peak titers and replication kinetics as the 98 parental wild-type MHV-A59 (Fig. 1b) . MHV-EGFP-nsp2, which was constructed in parallel 99 and contained the coding sequence of EGFP (34) instead of BirAR118G, was used as a control 100 and also reached wild-type virus peak titers, with slightly reduced viral titers at 9 hours post-101 infection (h.p.i.) compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 (Fig. 1b) . 102
To confirm the accommodation of BirAR118G within the viral RTC, MHV-A59-, MHV-103
BirAR118G-nsp2-, and mock-infected L929 fibroblasts were visualized using indirect 104 immunofluorescence microscopy. BirAR118G-nsp2 remained strongly associated with the MHV 105 RTC, as indicated by the co-localization of BirAR118G-nsp2 with established markers of the 106 MHV replicase, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8 ( Fig. 1c; Supplemental Fig. S1 ). This observation 107 corroborates previous studies demonstrating that nsp2, although not required for viral RNA 108 synthesis, co-localizes with other nsps of the coronaviral RTC (35-37).

BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells, demonstrating efficient proximity-dependent biotinylation of 112 RTC-proximal host factors ( Fig. 1c; Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Furthermore, to define the 113 localization of the nsp2 fusion protein at the ultrastructural level, we replaced the BirAR118G 114 biotin ligase with the APEX2 ascorbate peroxidase to generate recombinant MHV-APEX2-115 nsp2. APEX2 mediates the catalysis of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) into an insoluble 116 polymer that can be readily observed by electron microscopy (38). As shown in figure 1d , 117 APEX2-catalized DAB polymer deposition was readily detectable at characteristic coronavirus 118 replication compartments, such as DMVs and CM, categorically demonstrating that the nsp2 119 fusion proteins localize to known sites of coronavirus replication (4, 8). 120 Importantly, our collective results establish that the recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 121 replicates with comparable kinetics to wild-type MHV-A59, expresses a functional BirAR118G 122 biotin ligase that is tightly associated with the MHV RTC, and that biotinylated, RTC-proximal 123 proteins can be readily detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infected cells. 124 125
To further demonstrate the efficiency and specificity of BirAR118G-mediated biotinylation we 127 assessed, by western blot analysis, fractions of biotinylated proteins derived from MHV-A59-128 , MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-, or non-infected cells that were grown with or without the addition of 129 biotin (Fig. 2a,b) . A characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed 130 under all conditions where no exogenous biotin was added to the culture medium (Fig. 2b) . 131
The same pattern was detectable in non-infected and wild-type MHV-A59-infected cells when 132 the culture medium was supplemented with biotin, suggesting that the addition of biotin in the 133 .

In contrast, we observed a greatly increased fraction of 135 biotinylated proteins in lysates derived from MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells treated with 136
biotin. This result demonstrates that virus-mediated expression of the BirAR118G biotin ligase 137 results in efficient biotinylation when biotin is added to the culture medium. Moreover, we 138 could readily affinity purify, enrich, and recover the fraction of biotinylated proteins under 139 stringent denaturing lysis and washing conditions by using streptavidin-coupled magnetic 140 beads (Fig. 2b) . 141
Affinity purified proteins derived from biotin-treated MHV-A59-and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-142 infected cells were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (n=3). Liquid chromatography 143 tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from in-gel digested samples and log-144 transformed label free quantification (LFQ) levels were used to compare protein enrichment 145 between samples (Fig. 2c) . Overall, 1381 host proteins were identified, of which 513 were 146 statistically significantly enriched in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected samples over MHV-A59-147 infected samples. These host proteins represent a comprehensive repertoire of RTC-proximal 148 factors throughout MHV infection (Fig. 2c, table S1 ). Importantly, viral replicase gene 149 products nsp2-10 and nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein were significantly enriched in 150 fractions derived from MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells (Fig. 2c, d) . This is in agreement 151 with studies demonstrating co-localization and interactions amongst individual nsps, and with 152 studies showing association of the nucleocapsid protein with the coronavirus RTC (8,[39][40][41]. 153
It also highlights the specificity and effectiveness of the labeling approach in live cells and is 154 the first experimental evidence showing that collectively these viral nsps and the nucleocapsid 155 (N) protein are subunits of the coronavirus RTC. Furthermore, these results corroborate 156 previous reports that nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC (10-12, 157 42). Amongst the "not detected" or "not enriched" viral proteins are (i) nsp11, which is a short 158 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Accordingly, we 172 identified RTC-proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV 173 RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (rtn4; Fig. 2e ), and host proteins where co-localization 174 by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic 175 translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; Fig. 2e ). However, in the latter case, a more sensitive 176 detection technique, such as a proximity ligation assay that relies on proximity-dependent 177 antibody-coupled DNA probe amplification (43), demonstrated proximity of eIF3E and 178 dsRNA in MHV-infected cells (Fig. 2f) . 179
Collectively, our results show that the approach of integrating a promiscuous biotin ligase as 180 an integral subunit into a coronavirus RTC revealed a comprehensive list of host cell proteins 181 that comprises the RTC microenvironment. The efficacy and specificity of our approach is best 182 illustrated by the fact that we were able to identify all expected viral components of the MHV 183 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0
8 peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned 159 role or function in coronavirus replication, (ii) the structural proteins spike (S) protein, 160 envelope (E) protein, and membrane (M) protein, which mainly localize to sites of viral 161 assembly before being incorporated into newly-formed viral particles, and (iii) all accessory 162 proteins (NS2a, HE, ORF4, ORF5a). Altogether, these results validate the proximity-163 dependent biotinylation approach and demonstrate the specific and exclusive labeling of MHV-164 RTC-associated proteins (Fig. 2d) . 165
The BirAR118G biotin ligase biotinylates proteins in its close proximity that must not necessarily 166 have tight, prolonged, or direct interaction (31). Therefore, the identified RTC-proximal host 167 proteins, recorded over the entire duration of the MHV replication cycle, likely include proteins 168 that display a prolonged co-localization with the MHV RTC, proteins that may locate only 169 transiently in close proximity to the RTC, and proteins of which only a minor fraction of the 170 cellular pool may associate with the RTC. To this end, we assessed the localization of a limited 171 proteins, were not amongst the significantly enriched proteins. Our data further suggest that 185 the RTC microenvironment may be highly dynamic and likely also contains proteins that are 186 only transiently present in the microenvironment or only comprise a sub-fraction of the cellular 187 pool in close proximity to the MHV RTC. terms were highly significant (p-value <0.005) (Fig. 3a , Table S2 ). Additional analysis using 195 network analysis, using STRING, revealed at least 4 distinct clusters of interacting factors 208 within this category (Fig. 3b) . Cluster I, protein transport, comprised nuclear transport 209 receptors at nuclear pore complexes, such as importins and transportins. Interestingly, this 210 cluster also contained Sec63, which is part of the Sec61 translocon (44) and has been implicated 211 in protein translocation across ER membranes. The list of RTC-proximal factors also included 212 signal recognition particles SRP54a and SRP68 (Table S2) In order to assess the potential functional relevance of RTC-proximal factors identified in our 266 MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-mediated proximity-dependent screen, we designed a custom siRNA 267 library individually targeting the expression of each of the 513 identified RTC-proximal host 268 proteins. siRNA-treated L929 cells were infected (MOI=0.05, n=4) with a recombinant MHV 269 vesicular transport between the ER, Golgi apparatus and endosomal compartments for the 283 establishment of replication organelles, several factors contained within these pathways 284 impaired MHV replication as exemplified by the siRNA-mediated silencing of Kif11, Snx9, 285 Dnm11, Scfd1, Ykt6, Stx5a, Clint1, Aak11, or Vapa (Fig. 4b) . Consistently, ER-associated 286 protein sorting complexes associated with the ribosome and newly synthetized proteins (Naca, 287 BTF3, SRP54a, SRP68) that were revealed in the GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3a, table S2) , 288 also appear to be required for efficient MHV replication (Fig. 4b) . 289 Furthermore, we also observed significantly reduced MHV replication upon silencing of core 290 elements of the 26S and 20S proteasome complex (Psmd1 and Psmc2, and Psmb3, 291 respectively), suggesting a crucial role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for efficient CoV 292 replication (27, 52). Indeed, this finding may provide a link to the described coronavirus RTC-293 encoded de-ubiquitination activity residing in nsp3 that has been implicated in innate immune 294 evasion (16, 17, 54). 295
Most interestingly, this custom siRNA screen identified a crucial role of the host protein 296 synthesis apparatus that was associated with the MHV RTC as indicated by the proximity-297 dependent proteomic screen (Fig. 3a, c) . Silencing of ribosomal proteins Rpl13a and Rls24d1 298 and several subunits of the eIF3 complex resulted in greatly reduced MHV replication and 299 scored with highest significance in the siRNA screen, suggesting that proximity of the host cell 300 translation machinery to the viral RTC likely has functional importance for coronavirus 301 replication (Fig. 4b) . 302 303 Active translation near sites of viral mRNA synthesis 304 .

For this, we selected all host 306 factors assigned to the category "translation" (Fig. 3a) and assessed virus replication following 307 siRNA-mediated silencing of each factor. Measurement of luciferase activity after MHV-Gluc 308 infection confirmed initial findings obtained by screening the entire siRNA library of MHV 309 RTC-proximal factors (Fig. 4c) . Specifically for Rpl13a, and eIFs 3i, 3f, and 3e viral replication 310 was reduced to levels comparable to our controls Ceacam1a (MHV receptor) and Gbf1 (24). 311

The HCoV-331 229E RTC, which was detected with an antiserum directed against nsp8, appeared as small and 332 dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection and eventually converged into larger 333 perinuclear structures later in infection. Consistent with findings obtained for MHV, we 334 observed a striking co-localization of the HCoV-229E RTC with sites of active translation 335 during the early phase of the infection (Fig. 6, S4) .

We therefore 381 expect that this approach will find wide application in the field of virus-host interaction, target 382 identification for virus inhibition, and provides a starting point to reveal similarities and 383 differences between replication strategies of a broad range of viruses. 384
One novel finding that arose immediately from our RTC-proximity screen is the demonstration 385 of a close spatial association of host cell translation with the coronavirus RTC. Indeed, the 386 biotin ligase-based proteomic screen identified a number of translation initiation factors, most 387 prominently several eIF3 subunits that were found to have functional importance for viral 388 replication, and numerous ribosome-and translation-associated proteins within the coronavirus 389 RTC microenvironment (Fig. 3, 4) . In addition, the presence of subunits of the signal uncorrected Dunn's test) was used to test the statistical significance of reduced viral replication 641 (mean < 95% as compared to scramble control, n=216).
