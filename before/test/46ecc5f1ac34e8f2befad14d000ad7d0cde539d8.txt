The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.
We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 : bioRxiv preprint mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.
(IPVYQVNNLEEICQLIIQAF). They also suggested that a CTL vaccine could be designed using epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells identified in these EBOV controllers.
Human pathogen-derived peptide antigens that are also recognized by C57BL/6 T-cells have been previously described. These include peptides from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RGYVYQGL [68] , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RGPGRAFVTI [5] . The existence of such epitopes makes a range of preclinical vaccine experiments possible without having to rely on non-human pri- 35 mates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al. showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [73] . Wilson et al. came to this conclusion 40 based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector. Their experiments showed that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice re-stimulated with NP43-53
We fabricated adjuvanted microspheres for this study as a room temperature stable dry powder using the Flow Focusing process to be 11ÂµM in diameter so as to prevent more than one microsphere from being phagocytosed by any given antigen presenting cell (APC) at the same time [37] . By loading only one peptide 55 sequence per microsphere, we maximized the peptide payload and mitigated the possibility of multiple, different peptide sequences being delivered to the APC simultaneously, which could possibly result in competitive inhibition at the motif which could interfere with antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell expansion (Supplementary Material Section 1). 60 We also set out to see if a similar approach to a CTL vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2 would be feasible based on an analysis of the HLA binding characteristics of peptide sequences on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid.
We used a previously described biodegradable dry powder, PLGA microsphere, synthetic vaccine platform adjuvanted with TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists for this study [48] . In that article, we showed that the TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists given together with a peptide in a mouse model did not produce T-cell expansion by ELISPOT and that microencapsulation of the peptide and the TLR-9 ligand, with the TLR-4 ligand in the injectate solution, was required to 70 elicit an immune response to the delivered peptide antigen as determined by
ELISPOT. That study also demonstrated that the microencapsulated peptides alone were insufficient to induce an adequate immune response without the presence of the TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists administered as described. The TLR agonists used for this vaccine formulation are used in FDA approved vaccines 75 and can be sourced as non-GMP or GMP material for pre-clinical and clinical studies.
We show here that the H2-D b restricted epitopes VSV (RGYVYQGL) and OVA (SIINFEKL), when administered to C57BL/6 mice, each produce a CD8+ ELISPOT response to the administered peptide antigen with no statistically 80 significant CD4+ response measurable by ELISPOT as shown in Figure 2c , and We used this adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform to immunize C57BL/6 mice with NP43-53, the CTL+ class I peptide antigen from the Ebola Ziare NP protein identified as protective by Wilson et al. [73] . Microspheres 85 containing NP43-53 and CpG were prepared as a dry powder formulation and suspended before use in a PBS injectate solution containing MPLA, and administered intradermally via injection at the base of the tail into mice as described in a previous publication [48] . As illustrated in Figure 1c , there was no statistically significant difference between the ELISPOT data for the vaccinated mice 90 versus the response seen in the negative ELISPOT controls.
Wilson reported that protection seen in her experiment was due to a peptide sequence within NP-43-53. We hypothesized that the NP43-53 epitope was inefficiently processed into MHC binding sub-sequences during antigen presentation. In order to explore possible H2-D b matches for peptide sequences 95 contained within Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC), we prepared three peptide vaccine formulations, each containing one of the three possible 9mer sub-sequences within NP43-53. These sequences are shown in Table 1 . We then vaccinated, via intradermal (tail) injection, three groups of mice with microspheres containing one of the three 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53 (6 per 100 group). ELISPOT analysis was performed, stimulating harvested splenocytes with the three possible 9mer sub-sequences. Splenocytes from mice receiving the NP44-52 sub-sequence had a statistically higher ELISPOT response than mice vaccinated with the other two possible sub-sequence 9mers (P < 0.0001) as shown in Figure 1a . This is consistent with the predicted H2-D b binding 9mer Sub-sequences of VYQVNNLEEIC . This peptide has a predicted favorable H2-I b binding affinity as shown in Supplementary Material Table 5 .
We showed that vaccination of 6 mice with the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine loaded with VG19 and NP44-52 showed an ELISPOT response to NP44-52
whereas 6 mice vaccinated with adjuvanted microspheres not loaded with pep-115 tide did not (Figure 1d ).
We also showed that mice vaccinated with VG19 alone did not show an ELISPOT response to NP44-52 ( Figure 2a ) and, conversely, mice vaccinated with NP44-52 did not show a response to VG19 (Figure 2b ).
We conducted a pilot study demonstrating that intraperitoneal injection of 120 the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine produced a statistically superior immune Peak mortality across all groups tested was seen in mice challenged with 1,000 PFU maEBOV versus PBS buffer control as shown in the survival curve in in all active vaccinated mice exposed to 1,000 PFU maEBOV.
PBS buffer mock-vaccinated mice showed mortality increasing from the 100 PFU to 1,000 PFU as shown in Figure 4a and Figure 3a . We saw a paradoxical effect in control animals with survival increasing between 1,000PFU (Figure 3a) and 10,000 PFU ( Figure 5a ). We believe this was caused by innate immunity triggered by the very large maEBOV challenge. All mice in all vaccinated We saw what appears to be an innate immune response at the 10,000 PFU EBOV exposure level. It has been suggested that EBOV can mediate an innate immunity response through stimulation of TLR-4 [33] . Because the adjuvanted 7 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We conclude that level of protection conferred by the adjuvanted vaccine described in this study is dependant on delivering peptides with the microspheres.
The data in Supplementary Material Figure 1 also shows, in two separate experiments conducted months apart with the same 100 PFU maEBOV challenge dose and the same (active) vaccine formulation, that the vaccinated animals in both active groups had 100% survival and no morbidity by clinical observation.
This provides some evidence that the protective effect of vaccination using this 170 adjuvanted microsphere vaccine is reproducible.
Serum samples from sacrificed animals exposed to EBOV who did not receive vaccine were quantitatively assayed for various cytokines using BioPlex plates.
Animals having unwitnessed demise did not have serum samples collected. A Pearson Correlation Analysis was performed to assess relationships between 175 specific cytokine levels and survival. The results are shown in Table 3 . Retrieved sequences were processed using multiple sequence alignment (MSA) via Clustal for the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [34] . The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein sequences were trimmed down to every possible peptide sequence 9 amino acids in length. 9mers were chosen because they typically represent A subset of these SARS-CoV-2 peptide sequences are present on SARS-
Immunology Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) collected after a previous outbreak [65] . Predicted values of these peptides were cross referenced 225 with actual in-vitro binding measurements from identical 9mer peptides when that data was available.
Most preventative vaccines are designed to elicit a humoral immune response, typically via the administration of whole protein from a pathogen. Antibody 230 vaccines typically do not produce a robust T-cell response. [72] A T-cell vaccine is meant to elicit a cellular immune response directing CD8+ cells to expand and attack cells presenting the HLA Class I restricted pathogen-derived peptide antigen.

EBOV can cause severe pulmonary problems in exposed subjects [39] . These problems can be especially severe when the virus is delivered by aerosol [15][31].
Interaction of EBOV specific antibody, NHP lung tissue and EBOV delivered to NHPs via aerosol can produce a more lethal effect than in NHPs without circulating anti-EBOV antibody exposed to aerosolized EBOV (unpublished Table 4 ) [65] . Taken together, a peptide vaccine based on YQVNNLEEI and VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG could produce a cellular immune response in about 50% of the population of the Sudan and about 30% of the population of North America.

In addition, a peptide vaccine mitigates the risk of Antibody Disease Enhancement (ADE) seen in the context of a non-neutralizing antibody response to 360 a whole protein vaccine [75] [55] . Also, neutralizing antibodies directed against spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 patients have been associated with an increased risk of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) [35] . Specifically, patients succumbing to SARS-CoV-1 were found to develop a neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to spike protein faster than survivors after the onset of symptoms and the NAb titers 365 were higher in the patients who died compared with those who recovered [76] . To the extent to which antibody vaccines producing an antibody response against the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of ALI, this risk could also be mitigated by a using peptide vaccine as an alternative approach.
