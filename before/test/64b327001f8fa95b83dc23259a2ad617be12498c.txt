One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability. Here we compared the development of HIV-1 28 resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) between wild-type (WT) virus and a synthetic 29 virus (MAX) carrying a codon-pair re-engineered protease sequence including 38 (13%) 30 synonymous mutations. WT and MAX viruses showed indistinguishable replication in 31 MT-4 cells or PBMCs. Both viruses were subjected to serial passages in MT-4 cells 32 with selective pressure from the PIs atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). After 32 33 successive passages, both the WT and MAX viruses developed phenotypic resistance to 34
PIs (IC 50 14.6 ± 5.3 and 21.2 ± 9 nM for ATV, and 5. 9 ± 1.0 and 9.3 ± 1.9 for DRV, 35 respectively). Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus. Our results 43 indicate that HIV-1 protease position in sequence space delineates the evolution of its 44 mutant spectra. Nevertheless, the investigated synonymously recoded variant showed 45 mutational robustness and evolvability similar to the WT virus.

In this study, we evaluated how synonymous recoding of 52 the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease impacts the development of 53 protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. HIV-1 protease is a main target of current 54 antiretroviral therapies. Our present results demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) virus 55 and the virus with the recoded protease exhibited different patterns of resistance 56 mutations after PI treatment. Nevertheless, the developed PI resistance phenotype was 57 indistinguishable between the recoded virus and the WT virus, suggesting that the 58 synonymously recoded protease HIV-1 and the WT protease virus were equally robust 59 and evolvable.

In (Table 1) . WTp32 and MAXp32, respectively, showed 5-129 fold and 13-fold increases in IC 50 for ATV, and 6-fold and 10-fold increases in IC 50 for 130 DRV (Table 1) .

For each of the two studied viruses and 137 the two tested drugs, we sequenced between 1.9 × 10 7 and 4.1 × 10 7 individual protease 138 nucleotides (Table 2) . Sequence clonal analysis revealed no resistance-associated 139 substitutions in viruses propagated without drugs (Table 3) . On the other hand, both WT 140 and MAX viruses propagated in the presence of PIs developed previously described 141 resistance mutations to ATV and DRV (Table 3) . Moreover, the resistance variant 142 repertoire differed between the MAX and WT viruses (Table 3) . Specifically, the G16E (Table 2) , was also included in this analysis. We found that the five generated mutants 165 displayed comparable IC 50 values to ATV in both backgrounds, WT and MAX (Table   166 3). We also determined the replication capacity of these two ten mutant viruses in MT-4 167 cells with and without ATV (Fig. 2) . Similar to the IC50 results, the five tested variants The amino acid mutant repertoire also differed between the WT and MAX 176 viruses when they were propagated without drugs (Table 2) . Only one variant, D30N, 177 was detected in both virus populations. We do not know whether the observed variants 178 are adaptive or neutral mutations. Regardless, completely different mutant spectra were 179 detected in these two viruses. 180 We performed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of all WT and 181 MAX unique amino acid variants that were recovered after 32 MT-4 cell passages in the 182 presence of ATV or DRV. Remarkably, the results showed that the two viruses, which 183 shared an identical starting amino acid sequence, followed different evolutionary 184 trajectories (Fig. 3) .

However, with regards to other mutations, the explanation 237 for the difference is not readily apparent (e.g., S37P, G48L, Q58E and I84V). In 238 particular, the G48L substitution is very rarely selected in vivo in patients undergoing PI 239 therapy (37). However, when the above substitutions (S37P, G48L, Q58E, I84V or 240 L89I) were introduced in the WT sequence they showed parallel replication capacities 241 to those observed with a MAX background. We can speculate that the introduced 242 synonymous substitutions affected neighboring residues (e.g., RNA structure).
However, it must be noted that the MAX and WT proteases have similar RNA folding 244 free energy (10).
