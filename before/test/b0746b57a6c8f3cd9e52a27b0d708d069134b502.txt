The burden of emerging infectious diseases has significantly increased over the last decades 41 and is recognized as a major global health concern. In 2018, the World Health Organization 42 (WHO) established the "Blueprint priority disease list", identifying viruses such as Ebola, Lassa 43 fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Nipah fever as significant threats to 44 international biosecurity (1). This list also highlights the potential pandemic risk from the emer-45 gence of currently unknown zoonotic pathogens, collectively referring to these unknown threats 46 as "disease X" (1). Investigation of the potential zoonotic pathogens in wild animals, particu-47 larly vertebrates, is thus critical for emerging infectious diseases preparedness and responses. 48 Bats represent nearly 1,400 species and live on all continents except Antarctica. They pro- 49 vide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and soil Our study area spans geographic locations across the islands of the western Indian 58 Ocean (WIO) and southeastern continental Africa (SECA) (Figure 1 ). These land areas have 59 diverse geological origins that have influenced the process of bat colonization and species dis-60 tributions. The ecological settings and species diversity on these islands for bats are notably 61 different. On Madagascar, more than 45 bat species are known to occur, of which more than 80 62 author/funder.

The smaller studied islands of the WIO, Mauritius, Mayotte, Re-63 union Island, and Mahé (Seychelles), host reduced bat species diversity (e.g. three species on 64 Reunion Island), whereas SECA supports a wide range of bat species. To date, several studies 65 have identified bat-infecting CoVs in countries of continental Africa, including Zimbabwe (4), 66 South Africa (5), and Kenya (6). CoVs have also been reported in fruit bat (Pteropodidae) pop-67 ulations of Madagascar, where beta-coronaviruses belonging to the D-subgroup were identified 68 in the two bat species Eidolon dupreanum, and Pteropus rufus (7). 69 In this study, we investigated the presence of CoVs in over 1,000 individual bats be- Appendix Table S1 . 86 author/funder.

The prevalence of positive bats was different 153 according to the sampling locations (χ² = 70.2; p<0.001), with a higher prevalence in Mozam-154 bique (19.6% ± 4.7%) than on all WIO islands (4.2% ± 1.2%) (Figure 2) . A significant differ-155 ence in the prevalence of positive bats was also detected between families (χ² = 44.2; p<0.001;

In the context of WIO islands, we expect a strong geographical influence on CoVs diversity 248 rather than on host specificity, with independent evolution of CoVs on each island because of 249 spatial isolation and endemism. Anthony et al. (32) suggested that the dominant evolutionary 250 mechanism for African CoVs was host switching. In our study, congruence between host and 251 viral phylogenies suggests a strong signal for co-evolution between WIO bats and their associ-252 ated CoVs. This strongly suggests that individual bat species harbor specific CoV lineages, but 253 CoV transmission between different bat species may nevertheless occur infrequently.
