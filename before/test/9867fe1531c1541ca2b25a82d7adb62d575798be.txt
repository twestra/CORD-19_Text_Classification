SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 2 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its 3 transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary 4 sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the 5 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing 6 shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous 7 recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the 8 genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, 9 SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs 10 with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA 11 sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral 12 transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have 13 shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the 14 internal modification and the 3 ′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown 15 ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions 16 to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. 17 Kim et al. Highlights 21 • We provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and 22 epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA 23 nanoball sequencing. 24 • The transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination 25 events, both canonical and noncanonical. 26 • In addition to the genomic and subgenomic RNAs common in all 27 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown 28 ORFs. 29 • We discover at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA 30 motif. 31 Kim et al. designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 34 (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, 35 family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae), SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped 36 virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of~30 kb. 37 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, together with SARS-CoV 38 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (with 80% and 39 50% homology, respectively) (Kim et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Coronaviruses 40 (CoVs) were thought to primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and 41 mammals. But, the recurring outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 42 have clearly demonstrated the remarkable ability of CoVs to cross species 43 barriers and transmit between humans (Menachery et al., 2017). 44 CoVs carry the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among all RNA virus families 45 (Figure 1). Each viral transcript has a 5 ′ -cap structure and a 3 ′ poly(A) tail (Lai 46 and Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977). Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA is 47 translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading 48 frames (ORFs), ORF1a, and ORF1b. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 49 440-500 kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The −1 ribosome frameshift occurs 50 immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows continued 51 translation of ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) which 52 is cleaved into 16 nsps. The proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases 53 nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease 54 domain, respectively.

The viral genome is also used as the template for replication and 56 transcription, which is mediated by nsp12 harboring RNA-dependent RNA 57 polymerase (RdRP) activity (Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015) . 58 Negative-strand RNA intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for 59 the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNAs 60 (sgRNAs). The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny 61 virions. Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein (S), 62 Kim et al.
From the full-length genomic RNA (29, 903 nt) which also serves as an mRNA, ORF1a and ORF1b are translated. In addition to the genomic RNA, nine major subgenomic RNAs are produced. The sizes of the boxes representing small accessory proteins are bigger than the actual size of the ORF for better visualization. The black box indicates leader sequence. Note that ORF10 is not included here because our data show no evidence for ORF10 expression. (Warkocki et al., 2018) . 98 In this study, we combined two complementary sequencing approaches, DRS 99 and SBS. We unambiguously mapped the sgRNAs, ORFs, and TRSs of A, Read counts from nanopore direct RNA sequencing of total RNA from Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. "Leader+" indicates the viral reads that contain the 5 ′ end leader sequence. "No leader" denotes the viral reads lacking the leader sequence.
"Nuclear" reads match to mRNAs from the nuclear chromosome while "mitochondrial" reads are derived from the mitochondrial genome. "Control" indicates quality control RNA for nanopore sequencing. 
To delineate the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, we first performed DRS runs on 106 a MinION nanopore sequencer using total RNA extracted from Vero cells 107 infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). The virus was 108 isolated from a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 26, 2020, 109 after traveling from Wuhan, China (Kim et al., 2020) . We obtained 879,679 110 reads from infected cells (corresponding to a throughput of 1.9 Gb) (Figure 2A ). 111
The majority (65.4%) of the reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that viral 112 transcripts dominate the transcriptome while the host gene expression is 113 strongly suppressed. Although nanopore DRS has the 3 ′ bias due to directional 114 sequencing from the 3 ′ -ends of RNAs, approximately half of the viral reads still 115 contained the 5 ′ leader.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome was fully covered, missing only 12 nt from the 5 ′ 117 end ( Figure 2B ). The longest tags (111 reads) correspond to the full-length 118 gRNA ( Figure 2B ). The coverage of the 3 ′ side of the viral genome is substantially 119 higher than that of the 5 ′ side, which reflects the nested sgRNAs. This is also 120 partly due to the 3 ′ bias of the directional DRS technique. The presence of the 121 leader sequence (72 nt) in viral RNAs results in a prominent coverage peak at the 122 5 ′ end, as expected. We could also clearly detect vertical drops in the coverage, 123 whose positions correspond to the leader-body junction in sgRNAs. All known 124 sgRNAs are supported by DRS reads, with the exception of ORF10 (see below). 125
In addition, we observed unexpected reads reflecting noncanonical 126 recombination events. Such fusion transcripts resulted in the increased coverage 127 towards the 5 ′ end ( Figure 2B , inner box). Early studies on coronavirus mouse 128 hepatitis virus reported that recombination frequently occurs (Furuya and Lai, exhibits a high coverage as expected for the nested transcripts.
The depth of DNB sequencing allowed us to confirm and examine the 138 junctions on an unprecedented scale for a CoV genome. We mapped the 5 ′ and 139 3 ′ sites at the fused junctions and estimated the recombination frequency by 140 counting the reads spanning the junctions ( Figure 3A ). The leader represents the 141 most prominent 5 ′ site, as expected ( Figure 3A , red asterisk on the x-axis). The 142 known TRSs are detected as the top 3 ′ sites ( Figure 3A , red dots on the y-axis).
These results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the canonical TRS-mediated 144 mechanism for discontinuous transcription to produce major sgRNAs ( Table S3 ). The second cluster shows a long-distance fusion 160 between sequences that do not have similarity to the leader ( Figure 3F , The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.988865 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 3 (previous page) | A, Positions of recombination sites determined by using junction-spanning reads from DNBseq data. The x-axis and y-axis show the positions of the 5 ′ sites and their joined 3 ′ sites, respectively. The frequency of the recombination was estimated by the read counts of the junction-spanning reads. The red asterisk on the x-axis is to indicate that the leader sequence. Please note that the left-most bins containing the leader TRS was expanded horizontally on this heatmap to improve visualization. The red dots on the sub-plot alongside the y-axis denote local peaks which coincide with the 5 ′ end of the body of each sgRNA. B, Transcript abundance was estimated by counting the DNBseq reads that span the junction of the corresponding RNA. C, Top 50 sgRNAs. The asterisk indicates an ORF beginning at 27,825 which may encode the 7b protein with an N-terminal truncation of 23 amino acid. The grey bars denote minor transcripts that encode proteins with an N-terminal truncation compared with the corresponding overlapping transcript. The black bars indicate minor transcripts that encode proteins in a different reading frame from the overlapping major mRNA. D, Canonical recombination. E, TRS-L-dependent noncanonical recombination between the leader TRS and a noncanonical 3 ′ site in the body. F, TRS-L-independent long-distance (>5,000 nt) recombination. G, TRS-L-independent local recombination yielding a deletion between proximal sites (20-5,000 nt distance).
Of note, the junctions in these noncanonical transcripts do not contain a numerous signal level changes corresponding to 5mC modification, even with 225 the unmodified controls ( Figure S1C ). We obtained highly comparable results 226 from the viral RNAs from infected cells ( Figure S1D ), demonstrating that the 227 5mC sites detected without a control may be false positives. 228 We, however, noticed intriguing differences in the ionic current (called 229 "squiggles") between negative control and viral transcripts ( Figure 5A ).
