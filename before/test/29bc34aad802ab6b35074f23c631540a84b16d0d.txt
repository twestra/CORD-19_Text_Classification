Background The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID-19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.
Methods Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R t ) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.
Findings We estimated that R t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards
1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which became stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.
Wuhan [2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14] . In practice, it becomes crucial to monitor quantitative changes in transmission rates and the effective reproduction number 23 R t over time to reveal the impacts of control measures [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . The 24 transmissibility depends on the biological properties of the coronavirus, as 25 well as the contact patterns which can be intervened at the national or social 26 levels in populations. The dynamic changes in transmissibility of in Wuhan and across provinces in China remain unknown. We hypothe- 28 sized that there could be a significant reduction of transmissibility with time 29 which is in accordance with the public health interventions in Wuhan and 30 other provinces. 31 Here we provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in 32 transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan, 33 Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to First, we build an index α k to represent the baseline infected cases in 102 province k on 20 January, 2020. Particularly, we will use T R k , F L k and M I k 103 to measure the relationship between provice k and Wuhan. We suppose
where β " pβ 1 , β 2 , β 3 q 1 are estimated by the observed Y kt in provinces k "
where '"' means 'distributed as'.
Under the unified leadership of the central goverment, we suppose the 113 trend of γ kt over day t is the same for 28 provinces, that is, η kt " η t is 114 independent of k so that 115 γ kt " η tˆγk,t´1 .
To avoid strong assumptions about the evolution of the epidemic, we allow 116 η t to be arbitray function of t. We determine the functional form of η t by 117 pointwise estimating η t and checking the resulting pattern over t. Denote 118 the resulting functional form for η t by η t " η t paq.
Finally, we notice that
With the chain calculation, we have dW kt " γ kt ś t´1 j"0 pγ kj`1 qW k0 and W kt " 121 ś t´1 j"0 pγ kj`1 qW k0 , where W k0 " α k and γ k0 " 0. In practice, the infected 122 patients will be isolated and removed from the infectious source. With the 123 notation m of duration of infectious period, we hence have
Denote γ 1 " pγ 11 ,¨¨¨, γ K1 q 1 and all of the parameters by δ " pγ 1 1 , a 1 , β 1 q 1 .

The modeling and the loglikelihood function for Hubei are similar with 131 those for 28 provinces except that F L k is replaced by RM k and provinces are 132 replaced by cities, because there are not flights between the cities in Hubei 133 and Wuhan, and the most people leave Wuhan by cars or buses. Specifically,
The modeling and the likelihood function for Wuhan are similar with 135 those for 28 provinces except that α k is directly estimated by the diagnosed 136 cases in Wuhan.

Rail transportation and migration Since γ kt " γ k1 ś t j"2 η j and the ratio of transmission rate η t are the same over 176 28 provinces, the initial transmission rates γ k1 can be used to compare the 177 strength of the prevention and control for the NCP epidemic in 28 provinces.

With the form of ηptq " a 0`a1 pt´t 1 q´`a 2 pt´t 2 q´with t 1 being January 248 27 and t 2 being January 30 and m " 6, we estimated the parameters based 249 on t " 1,¨¨¨, T in Wuhan using the method displayed in Section 2.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) displays the estimators of η t and R t , as well as their 251 95% CI, respectively, for Wuhan. The reproduction number R t decreased the changes of diagnosis criteria, the predicted cases were not comparable after February 13. However, as mentioned above, the estimated trend was 257 still informative to predict the turning point. Thus we estimate that the date 258 of containment would be around February 29, 2020 in Wuhan (Figure 5(c) ). could be in earlier January with sparse data. In our study, the initial R t 288 was estimated at 4.9 on January 21 and even higher at 8.13 before this date 289 (data not shown), larger than the estimation in other places as expected. We 290 also observed that the ratio for transmission rates decreased from January to prevent the spread of diseases. 313 We forecasted that COVID-19 will be contained across provinces around
