With our successful experience of treating COVID-19 patients, we 22 retrospectively found that routine clinical features could reliably predict severe 23 pneumonia development, thus provide quick and affordable references for 24 physicians to save the otherwise fatal patients with the limited medical 25 resource. Abstract 28 Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe 29 pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier 30 discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and 31 laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not 32 only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care 33 burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features 34 were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients, who were classified into mild (93 35 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3 36 to 7-days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and 37 multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission 38 differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid 39 with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-40 reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase 41 (LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease 42 development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver 43 operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four 44 factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia 45 individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH 46 significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 47 329 Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia
0.941, and specificity= 0.902). A combination consisting of 3-or 4-factors could 48 further increase the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA 49 .

Background 60 The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to sweep across the globe 61 ever since its first successful jump from bat to the human being through a yet illness, and severe viral pneumonia[2, 6-8]. Therefore, the most crucial issue is 80 to identify these patients and prioritize their treatment strategy by applying 81 .

prophylactically medical treatment and management before they progress to 82 the severe stage.
As known, the respiratory function worsens in the severe stage. In the 84 clinical practice, saturated oxygen (< 93% in rest state), reparatory rates (>30 85 times/min), and deteriorated chest radiology imaging (X-Ray and CT more high 86 resolution) provide references to confirm their severity [5, 9, 10] . Because of 87 the hypoxia stress, most patients will experience an over reactivated immune 88 storm, including elevated their expression level of some specific immunological 89 cytokines and changes of certain types of immune cell counts [6, 11] . Biopsy 90 analysis also showed that the lung bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with 91 cellular fibromyxoid exudates [12] . However, the CT imaging and immunology 92 detection is not only expensive but also far unavailable as for the explosive 93 increase of suspected cases, in particular in those hospitals not well equipped.
Can some routine clinical characteristics or/and laboratory measurement, or 95 their combinations predict the occurrence of severe cases?
In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 97 those patients who progressed to severe pneumonia later and found that five CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
