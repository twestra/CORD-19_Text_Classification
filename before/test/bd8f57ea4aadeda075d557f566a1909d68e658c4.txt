The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.
In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highly homologous with SARS(1). As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pres-sure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others (2) . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.
For RNA virus infections, especially acute respiratory infection, probe coupled RT-qPCR from respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methods were developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease control centers (10) . However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high purity samples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring long reaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its practical application in many cases, and thus can delay the required rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients.
Loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technology that provides nucleic acid amplification in a short time using 4 to 6 specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with chain displacement activity (Bst) under a constant temperature (60-65 ) (11, 12) . Particularly relevant for this application, is that LAMP can be combined with reverse transcription (i.e. RT-LAMP), were both reverse transcription and amplification occur simultaneously allowing the direct detection of RNA (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) .
This system, can be coupled with a pH indicator present in the reaction mix allowing readout of the amplification reaction by change in color (18) . Therefore, LAMP has the potential to offer an easy diagnostic test where the result could be directly observe the color change with the naked eye.
The present study describes an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19), for rapid colorimetric detection of 2019-Novel Coronavirus.

Respiratory samples were obtained from patients sent to the Shenyang CDC and tested by the RT-qPCR kit. RNA was further diluted for iLACO development and evaluation.
RNA was extracted from clinic samples with COVID-19 virus infection during the epidemic in Shenyang in 2020 with the Thermo nuclear acid extraction workstation in the P3 laboratory of CDC Shenyang. Before the experiment, the concentration of virus RNA sample was measured with Qubit 3.0 (Thermo Fisher).
COVID-19 virus RNA was reverse transcribed using random primer with Super-Script® III Reverse Transcriptase First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA).
The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 50°C for 1 h. The cDNA obtained was used as the detection sample of RT-LAMP reaction as well.
Two kits were used in parallel to validate the positive samples (BGI and Biotech & Biomedicine Science ( Shenyang)). Briefly, a 20 µl reaction volume containing 5μl RNA template, 13 μ l master mix, 2 μ l primer and probe mix. The reverse transcription reaction was performed at 50° for 5 minutes, the initial denaturation was 94° for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94° for 5s and annealing at 55° for 10s. The PCR apparatus used in this research were CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system. .

Mixed reactions were all performed in PCR thermo-cycler or water bath incubation at 65 °C for 20-40 minutes. Positive reactions resulted in a color change of phenol red pH indicator from pink to yellow due to decreased pH in the presence of extensive DNA polymerase activity. However, the negative reaction still kept pink. Later we prepared all the solutions with individual components to optimize the reaction solution, also with different dyes for color judgement sensitivity test.
Sample collection and analysis of samples were approved by the local CDC. The internal use of samples was agreed under the medial and ethical rules of each participating individuals.
RT-LAMP primers were designed by the online software Primer Explorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html). For the primer sets, we used the online tool Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primerblast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome) (19) to detect whether the primer sequence is specific to the human genome and retain the primers that all 3 pairs primers are specific. Then compare the primer region sequence with other viruses' genome by the online tool BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSe arch&LINK_LOC=blasthome) (20) to calculate the homology.

The concentration of each primer in primer mix were as followed: 0.2 µM of each outer primer (F3 and B3), 1.6 µM of each inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.4 µM of each loop primer(LF and LB) (21) .
We selected a region of the ORF1ab as target region that is currently used for RT-qPCR detection approaches (Fig. 1A) , and used the online software Primer Explorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) to design the RT-LAMP primers.
After the specificity analysis, we retained one primer set with several pairs of loop primers ( Table 1, 
We used one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient respiratory RNA sample validated by RT-qPCR to set up the iLACO assay. We confirmed that after 20 minutes of incubation in a thermoblock, using the designed RT-LAMP primers the targeted gene was successfully amplified and a color change was observed in the reaction tubes. Specifically, a change in color from pink to light yellow indicated a positive reaction while negative reactions retained a pink color.
To optimize of RT-LAMP reaction, we used five group of primers with variable LB oligos 1-5 (Table 1) . We evaluated their ability to produce an effective amplifica-.

After the incubation, in addition to the colorimetric change, a ladder of DNA with increasing size was observed with on an agarose gel confirming the expected DNA amplification (Fig. 2C) . The 5 sets of primers were further tested for efficiency and the primer group 4 (containing LB4) was chosen for further optimization, which showed the best sensitivity (data not shown). We also optimized the reaction temperature to 65° degree, as we did not observe any positive signal using the recommended 72° degree incubation previously used for ZIKA virus detection by LAMP assay (21) . iLACO showed similar performance when we compared the samples from SARS-CoV-2 RNA or cDNA, indicating the one-step isothermal amplification is sufficient and separated step for reverse transcription is not necessary.
In order to optimize the potential usage for field-based or bed-based detections, we checked the efficiency of iLACO in 1.5 ml tubes incubated with water bath or incubator. Twenty minutes of reaction is sufficient to detect the signal (Fig. 2D) . We notice the signal is stronger compared with incubation using a thermocycler commonly used for PCR . The longer incubation time caused the water drops on the top lid of the tube. To avoid this, we added few drops of mineral oil after adding all the required solutions. This set up can be further optimised by using micro Pasteur Pipettes coupled with thermo cups for processing.
To check the detection limit of iLACO, we prepared multiple reactions containing serial dilutions of synthesized ORF1ab gene (from 1,000,000 to 10 copies). As shown in Figure 3 , iLACO is very sensitive, and as low as 10 copies of ORF1ab gene were detected successfully (1:100000 dilution in Fig. 3A) . Further, we compared iLACO with RT-qPCR assay with the diluted RNA sample from patient number 200202(10 times dilution, SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration around 17 copies/ µl).. We observed .

However, the 20 µl volume reaction time in 1.5 ml tubes incubated on wather bath are much fastercompared to RT-qPCR or samples processedin 0.2 ml tubes in PCR thermocycler, partially due to the increased heating volume and even surrounding temperature.
To further expand the iLACO detection capability, we also checked the UV or Blue light stimulated fluorescence signal. We added SYBR green dye into the reaction mix prior to adding the sample. After 20 minutes incubation in 65 degree, the signal was observed with Gel imaging system (Fig. 4A ). SYBR green in positive reactions was observed clearly in positive reaction. We also chose a new type of nucleic acid dye GeneFinder TM , which has enhanced fluorescent signal and sensitivity. By exposing under Blue light, green fluorescence was observed clearly with naked eye in the positive reaction, whereas it remained original pink in the negative control (Fig. 4B) . author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This is most likely due to the presence of Tris or EDTA in the RNA dilution buffer when automatic RNA extraction workstation is used. This could be optimized by adjusting the concentration of used buffers. We recommend to use always a positive and a negative control sample resuspended in the same buffers used for patient RNA isolation.
The most popular methods for RNA virus detection so far are based on RT-PCR and/or RT-qPCR; while these methods only take a run time of 2-3 hours, they require Currently, there is a lack of specific drugs for the treatment of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, so the early detection and following treatment is essential to control the spread of the disease. Therefore the detection of COVID-19 is of vital importance. The first version of iLACO with six primers could specifically identify eight distinct regions of the ORF1ab target. Our blast analysis suggest that the highly specific primer set design have a low chance for unspecific amplifications (false positives).
