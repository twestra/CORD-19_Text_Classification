Translational control of memory processes is a tightly regulated process where the coordinated interaction and 47 modulation of translation factors provides a permissive environment for protein synthesis during memory 48 formation. Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-49 specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic 50 mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an 51 engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and 52 reversible phosphorylation of eIF2α causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo. Using this resource, 53 we discovered that temporally structured pan-neuronal protein synthesis is required for consolidation of long-54 term auditory threat memory. Targeted protein synthesis inhibition in CamK2α expressing glutamatergic 55 neurons in lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory, which was recovered with artificial chemogenetic 56 reactivation at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eIF2α in 57 CamK2α positive neurons in LA enhanced memory strength, but was accompanied with reduced memory 58 fidelity and behavior inflexibility. Our findings provide evidence for a finely tuned translation program during 59 consolidation of long-term threat memories.
Memory is the capacity of an organism to encode, store, and retrieve information, and often guides the 83 action of the organism towards a better survival outcome. Aversive life-threatening events often lead to long-84 term associative memories between the environment in which those events were experienced in and the 85 threat, such that a salient cue from the event when presented again can elicit species-specific defensive 86 behaviors. Pavlovian cued threat conditioning is a useful experimental paradigm for understanding the 87 biological substrates of an associative threat memory, in which a neutral cue (e.g. light or tone) co-presented 88 with an innately aversive stimulus (e.g. air puff or footshock) elicits a defensive response such as freezing by a 89 repeat presentation by itself 1 . Cued threat conditioning is particularly amenable to studying memory 90 consolidation process because one-trial training is sufficient to form a persistent long-term memory and a 91 unimodal cue can be used for memory retrieval. Long-term aversive memories are thought to recruit a 92 distributed network of neurons across the brain, including subnuclei within amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, 93 as well as the neocortex, depending on the brain state, cue complexity, and the sensory pathways engaged 2, 3 .
Lateral amygdala is the central sensory gateway for the amygdaloid complex and is crucially engaged both in 95 the processing and storage of the associative aversive memories 4, 5, 6 .
Decades of studies have reported that consolidation of long-term memories requires one or more 98 waves of new protein synthesis after the memory is first encoded 7, 8, 9, 10 ; however, the use of pharmacological 99 protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI) in these studies is burdened with limitations. For instance, an extensively 100 used PSI, anisomycin, causes unwanted side effects that include superinduction of immediate early genes, 101 activation of stress signaling pathways, and catecholamine release 11, 12 . Pharmacological PSIs also do not 102 discriminate between molecularly heterogeneous cell populations and thus, do not allow manipulation of cell 103 autonomous protein synthesis. Genetic approaches to alter the translation machinery at the initiation step 104 provide less ambiguous evidence for the role of protein synthesis in memory processes 13, 14 . However 105 constitutive deletion of genes encoding translational control molecules lacks the temporal control needed to 106 convincingly interrogate the role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation. Past attempts at making 107 chemogenetic tools for blocking protein synthesis have had limited success 15 .
A key regulatory step in mammalian protein synthesis is the assembly of active eIF2.GTP and initiator-110 methionyl tRNA into a ternary complex that binds the 40S ribosome. Various types of cellular stress engage 111 pathway-specific protein kinases that phosphorylate the α subunit of eIF2 on serine 51, which converts eIF2 112 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, a guanine exchange factor that promotes the conversion of 113 inactive eIF2.GDP to active eIF2.GTP. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2α stops the recycling of the ternary 114 complex and inhibits general translation 16 . However, phosphorylation of eIF2α also leads to a paradoxical 115 increase in gene-specific translation of transcripts harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) by 116 overcoming the inhibitory effects of uORFs on reinitiation at the putative start codon as ternary complexes 117 decline 17 . Dephosphorylation of eIF2α occurs during L-LTP as well as during consolidation and reconsolidation
4 of associative memories, and is thought to remove the constraint on general translation 14, 18 . Here, we have developed a novel cell type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibitor (ciPSI) that utilizes an inducible Nes.iPKR pan-neuronal ciPSI knock-in mice, which were viable and fertile. The Nes-iPKR mice expressed
EGFP-L10 in all neurons in the amygdala, as marked by complete overlap with NeuN staining (Fig. 1d) , as well 162 as in cortical areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory cortex, and hippocampal areas, 163 CA1 and CA3, and the dentate gyrus (Supplemental Fig. 2c-g) . Despite heterozygous deletion of Eef1a1 allele 164 and expression of the multicistronic cassette in Nes.iPKR mice, the mice displayed normal spontaneous 165 locomotion as well as thigmotaxis in open field tests (Supplemental Fig. 3a-c) .
To test the efficiency of ciPSI in blocking protein synthesis ex vivo, amygdala slices of Nes.iPKR mice 168 and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging (BONCAT) 27 surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) 28 , that measures translation elongation and is amenable for in vivo 174 labeling, was used to test ciPSI efficiency in awake behaving mice. SUnSET immunoblot showed that 175 Nes.iPKR mice centrally infused with 150 pg ASV exhibited a robust decrease in protein synthesis (~50%) 176 compared to controls (Fig. 2b) . The inhibition of protein synthesis was concomitant with a specific increase in 177 phosphorylation of eIF2α at 1h post ASV treatment both ex vivo (Fig. 2c ) and in vivo (Fig. 2d) , with no effect 178 on either the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) 179 pathways (Fig. 2d ). Next, we investigated the ASV pharmacokinetics in Nes.iPKR amygdala lysates by 180 harvesting tissue at increasing time points after drug infusion. We found that peak expression of iPKR is 181 reached at 0.5h, which steadily declines at 1h and 3h and is completely degraded by 6h (Fig. 2e) .
Subsequently, phosphorylation of eIF2α steadily increased at 0.5h and 1h and then declined to baseline at 3h.
As a result of phosphorylation of eIF2α, proteins whose transcripts harbor uORFs, specifically ATF4 and 184 GADD34, accumulated and remained at higher levels compared to control until 3h (Fig. 2e) . GADD34 is the 185 regulatory subunit of the eIF2α phosphatase 17 , and the negative feedback due to increased GADD34 levels 186 combined with the degradation of iPKR by NS3/4 protease at 3h time point might be responsible for reduced synthesis 29, 30 . To determine whether chemogenetic inhibition of pan-neuronal protein synthesis influences persistent cortical and thalamic input-specific synaptic potentiation in principal excitatory neurons within LA 37, 232 38 . Thus, we asked whether de novo protein synthesis in CamK2α-positive principal neurons in LA is necessary 233 for aversive memory consolidation. We virally delivered CamK2α.Cre.EGFP into the bilateral LA of iPKR mice 234 and control mice (Fig. 4a) . Phosphorylation of eIF2α was increased specifically in CamK2α.iPKR neurons 235 compared to wild-type mice and non-EGFP positive neurons in the same animals ( Fig. 4b) with a 236 corresponding decrease in de novo translation (Fig. 4c ) upon ASV administration. CamK2α.iPKR mice were 237 threat conditioned as previously and centrally infused with ASV immediately after training (Fig. 4d ).
CamK2α.iPKR mice were comparable to wild-type controls in memory acquisition (Fig. 4e ), but LTM tested 24h 239 later was significantly impaired (Fig. 4f-h) . This LTM consolidation deficit with ciPSI was prevented by pre-240 training administration of ISRIB, a drug that rescues the p-eIF2α mediated constraint on general translation by 241 enhancing the activity of eIF2B ( Fig. 4g -h) 39 . We also tested ASV-treated CamK2α.iPKR mice in open field test 242 and elevated plus maze to gauze anxiety related behaviors and found that although spontaneous locomotion 
It is evident that the translation program regulated by eIF2α is necessary for LTM consolidation; 247 however, the accumulation of ATF4 raises the question of whether it is either decreased protein synthesis or 248 increased ATF4 levels causing the memory deficit. Indeed, a previous study has reported that even in the Fig. 5b ), but strongly impaired LTM (Supplemental 261 Fig. 5c and d) . Together, the LTM deficit observed using two independent approaches for blocking translation 262 initiation in CamK2α.iPKR and CamK2α.4Ekd respectively strongly support our hypothesis that de novo 263 translation in LA Camk2α+ neurons is necessary for consolidation of long-term threat memories.

Congruently, although all of the mice learned auditory threat 274 conditioning (Fig. 5c) CamK2a.iPKR mice were completely rescued by dephosphorylating both alleles of eIF2α, but was unaltered by 280 dephosphorylating one allele of eIF2α ( Fig. 5e-f ). This indicated that the translation tone and LTM 281 consolidation process is set by the phosphorylation of eIF2α, even when the abundance of phosphorylatable 282 eIF2α is reduced by half, and confirmed that the memory deficit caused by iPKR is through the phosphorylation 283 of eIF2α and not due to non-specific cellular toxicity.
Notably, the memory enhancement in the CamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) mice came with a cost. We found that 286 the dysregulated increase in translation tone in CamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) mice resulted in impaired behavioral 287 flexibility during the tone offset in LTM test. CamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) mice freeze starting at tone onset, but 288 continue to freeze after the tone offset during inter-trial interval epochs (Supplemental Fig. 6b and Fig. 5g ).
This failure to switch off defensive state is triggered only after the onset of first tone while at pre-conditioned The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We injected a cocktail of AAV.CamK2α.Cre together with control mice in a differential threat conditioning paradigm that involves three interleaved presentations of a 307 paired tone (CS+) and an unpaired tone (CS-) in a single session (Fig. 6c-d) . Consistent with earlier data, post-308 training ASV infusion impaired LTM and led to a significant decline in freezing response to paired tone ( Fig. 6f 
To further understand what happens when eIF2α-controlled general translation in LA principal neurons 319 is boosted during consolidation of a complex memory, we explored differential threat conditioning in CamK2α 320 eIF2α S51A mice (Supplemental Fig. 7c ). We found that whereas homozygous CamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) mice can 321 discriminate between CS+ and CS-during LTM, they have a significantly increased freezing response to CS-.
On the other hand, CamK2α wild-type mice robustly discriminated CS+ from CS-and displayed negligible 323 freezing response to CS-(Supplemental Fig. 7d ). The enhanced CS-response in theCamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) 324 mice resulted in a poor discrimination index (Supplemental Fig. 7e ). We next examined the freezing during ITI, 325 and found that similar to earlier results with simple threat conditioning, CamK2α.eIF2α (A/A) exhibited a 326 significantly increased freezing response following tone offset, indicating behavioral inflexibility (Supplemental 327 Fig. 7f
