China reported a major outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, from mid-January till 21 mid-March 2020. The number of cases outside China is now growing fast, while in mainland 22
China the virus outbreak is largely under control. We review the epidemic virus growth and 23 decline curves in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the 24 outbreak dynamics using three parameters that characterize the epidemic's timing, rate and 25 peak. During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 -4.4) 26 days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after 27 suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of 28 reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of 29 starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province 30
Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete 31 suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, 32 social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of 33 the disease in China has been successful, demonstrating that suppression is a viable strategy to 34 contain SARS-CoV2. 35 36 Funding: NA. 37 All rights reserved.

Wuhan according to Wang, Liu (10)). If underreporting is accounted for, the proportion of 65 infected people requiring hospitalization is still in the order of 3% or more. Containment is 66 based on intensive surveillance of possible cases, testing, followed by isolation of infected 67 people and their contacts [11]. Containment is only possible if the virus is not freely 68 circulating in a population. Currently, because in many countries outside of China the virus is 69 circulating within the population, these countries are practicing suppression. Policy makers 70 may ask: 71
(1) How long will it take for the epidemic to peak after suppression measures have been 73 implemented? 74
(2) What will the peak number of sickness cases be? 75 (3) How long do suppression measures need to be maintained to suppress the virus to 76 sufficiently low incidence to allow containment (search and quarantine flare-ups of the 77 virus)? 78 79 Here we analyze with a phenomenological logistic model the epidemics of SARS-CoV2 in 80
China and 20 of its provinces that reported more than 150 cases. The logistic model is widely 81 used in ecology to analyze boom and bust population dynamics [12]. Logistic models are not 82 as widely used in human disease epidemiology as more mechanistic compartment-based SIR 83 and SEIR models [13][14][15][16] because the parameters lack a strict mechanistic interpretation in 84 terms of transmission rate and disease etiology (e.g. latency period, incubation period and 85 infectious period). However, this disadvantage is compensated by the usefulness of the 86 parameters for providing a simple and intuitive description of the outbreak dynamics in time. 87 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10. 1101 We do not imply that logistic models can replace established epidemiological models, but we 88 do argue that phenomenological models, given the urgency and severe consequences of the 89 worldwide SARS-CoV2 outbreak for public health management, have a place along 90 mechanistic models to inform on disease dynamics [17] and support narratives on outbreak 91 dynamics with simple metrics like relative rate of increase, doubling time, and time to the 92 peak. Using data from China, logistic models shows the key disease dynamic parameters 93 before and after suppression policies were implemented [18]. 94 95
is available yet. Unless a successful NPI (Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention) strategy is 48 implemented in the early stages of transmission, an exponential global proliferation threatens 49 to overwhelm the health care systems of many countries. Three NPI strategies are being 50 discussed for managing the current COVID-19 epidemic: (1) suppression, (2) mitigation, and 51
(3) containment [3] . In suppression, strict measures are taken to reverse the epidemic spread, 52 essentially by bringing the effective reproduction number Re (the number of new cases per 53 existing case) below one [4, 5] . Social distancing is a key factor in suppression [6] . In 54 mitigation the aim is not to necessarily stop all transmission, but rather to reduce the rate of 55 transmission and in effect lower the number of infected people at any given time [3, 7] . It has 56 been suggested that mitigation strategies might prevent inundation of the health care system 57 by "flattening" the peak of sick people" [3] . However, even in the most optimistic scenarios 58 for mitigation, healthcare capacity is likely to be still seriously overwhelmed, as it was in 59
Wuhan in February 2020 and in Italy in March 2020. Herd immunity has been suggested as a 60 component of mitigation, but is only a viable option once a vaccine is available because up to 61
The number of reported active sick cases (total infected minus recovered minus deceased) in 161
Hubei peaked 25 days after suppression measures were implemented, which in the model also 162
indicates the peak of number of deaths on the same day. Outside Hubei, the peak number of 163 reported sick cases (and peak of daily number dying) was on average reached 18 days after 164 the start of suppression (Table 1 ). The rate of daily increase in reported cases peaked 17 days 165 after the start of suppression measures in Hubei, and on average 10 days after the start of 166 measures in the other provinces (range: 8 to 15 days). When assuming a reporting delay of 6 167 days [9] , the actual peak in the rate of increase occurred at 11 days after the implementation of 168 measures in Hubei and at 4 days after the implementation of measures in the other provinces. 169
The actual peak in the number of sick cases peaked at 19 days after the start of measures in 170
Hubei and at 12 days after the start of measures in the other provinces. 171
The relative rate of increase in the number of cases at the time of the peak rate was rather 173 consistent among provinces, with an average of 0.11 cases/case/day for Hubei and 0.12 174 cases/case/day for the rest of China (range: 0.08 to 0.15). Between suppression 175 implementation and the peak number of reported cases, the number of active cases in Hubei 176 increased by a factor 39, while in other provinces it increased by a factor of 9.5 with 177 considerable variation between provinces (range: 6.2 in Hainan and Chongqing to 20.4 in 178 Heilongjiang). If a 6-day reporting delay is accounted for in the estimate of the factor increase 179 from the start of measures to the peak, then this multiplication factor is diminished to a value 180 of 9.5 for Hubei and an average of 2.6 for the other provinces. The daily death rate of the 181 active sick people was 0.34 percent per day for Hubei, much higher than in other provinces 182 (on average 0.05 percent per day, ranging between 0 in Jiangsu Province (see also Sun, Qiu 183 (25)) and 0.18 percent per day in Hainan Province, Appendix 3), which indicates that on the 184 faster than the rate of decline during the tapering out of the epidemic (Appendix A1). Thus, 210 the logistic underestimates both the early relative growth rate and the increase of the number 211 of sick people from the start of measures till the peak for the Chinese data (Appendix A1). 212
Uncertainties in predictions also result from unknown reporting delay [9] . Improvements may 213 be possible by defining better tailored models, and especially, by collecting better data, e.g.
