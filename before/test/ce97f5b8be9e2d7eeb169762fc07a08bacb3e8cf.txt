19 Base J, β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA 20 Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how 21 specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription 22 termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-23 glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass 24 spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein 25 (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate 26 JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, 27 JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian 28 PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. 29 Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of 30 PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3'-end of polycistronic gene arrays in 31 Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, 32 suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In 33 addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for 34 host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation 35 of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating 36 polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids. 37 38 Author Summary 39 Trypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping 40 sickness in humans. The genome of T. brucei is organized into polycistronic gene clusters that contain 41 multiple genes that are co-transcribed from a single promoter. We have recently described the presence 42 of a modified DNA base J and variant of histone H3 (H3.V) at transcription termination sites within gene 43 clusters where the loss of base J and H3.V leads to read-through transcription and the expression of 44 downstream genes.

56 Introduction
Termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process 58 where the polymerase stops RNA chain elongation and dissociates from the end of the gene or 59 transcription unit. However, the underlying termination mechanism is not fully understood. In typical 60 eukaryotes, Pol II termination of protein-coding genes is tightly linked to the processing of the nascent 61 transcript 3' end (reviewed in (1)). This association ensures complete formation of stable polyadenylated 62 mRNA products and prevents the elongating Pol II complex from interfering with transcription of 63 downstream genes. Transcription through the polyadenylation site results in an exchange of transcription 64 factors, resulting in the regulation of the elongation-to-termination transition, in an ordered series of 65 events: 1) dissociation of the elongation factor Spt5, 2) Pol II pausing, 3) changes in phosphorylation 66 status of Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), which promotes 4) recruitment of cleavage factors and 67 termination factors, 5) transcript cleavage and 6) termination by the 5'-3' 'torpedo' exoribonuclease 68 XRN2/Rat1.
Critical to this process is the regulation of protein phosphorylation by the major eukaryotic protein 70 serine/threonine phosphatase, PP1. As recently demonstrated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces 71 pombe (S. pombe), the PP1 phosphatase Dis2 regulates termination by de-phosphorylating both Thr4P of .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 72 the Pol II-CTD as well as Spt5 (2). This PP1-dependent dephosphorylation allows the efficient recruitment 73 of the termination factor Seb1 as well as decreased Spt5 stimulation of Pol II elongation that enhances 74 the capture by the torpedo exoribonuclease. Transcription termination was also affected in the S. 75 cerevisiae PP1 isotype Glc7 mutant (3). PP1 action is modulated through the formation of heteromeric 76 complexes with specific regulatory subunits (4). These regulatory protein subunits regulate PP1 by 77 targeting the protein to specific subcellular compartments, to particular substrates, or reduce its activity 78 towards potential substrates. The vast majority of regulators are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 79 and bind PP1 via a primary PP1-binding motif, the RVxF motif (4-6). One of the key PP1 regulatory 80 proteins in the nucleus is the PP1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) (7, 8). PNUTS is a multidomain 81 protein defined by the canonical PP1 RVxF interaction motif. It also has an N-terminal domain that 82 interacts with the DNA binding protein Tox4 and a domain near the C-terminus that interacts with Wdr82 83 (9). This stable multimeric complex in humans is named the PTW/PP1 complex. Targeting of the complex 84 to chromatin is presumably due in part through associations with Tox4. While the function of Wdr82 in this 85 complex is not known, it may mediate interactions with Pol II by recognizing Ser5-phosphorylated CTD, 86 as it does when it is associated with the Set1 complex (10). In yeast, PP1 is associated with PNUTS and 87 Wdr82 homologs in APT, a subcomplex of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (11-14), and their 88 deletion caused termination defects at Pol II-dependent genes (15, 16). In mammals, PNUTS and Wdr82 89 mutant cells have defects in transcription termination at the 3' end of genes and 5' antisense transcription 90 at bi-directional promoters (17).
Members of the Kinetoplastida order include the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei that causes 92 African Sleeping sickness. Kinetoplastids are early-diverged protozoa with unique genome arrangements 93 where genes are organized into polycistronic transcription units (PTU) that are transcribed by Pol II. Pre-94 messenger RNAs (mRNA) are processed to mature mRNA with the addition of a 5' spliced leader 95 sequence through trans-splicing, followed by 3' polyadenylation (reviewed in (18)). Given the close 96 relationship between poly(A) processing and transcription termination in other eukaryotes, it is not clear 97 how multiple functional poly(A) sites within the trypanosome PTU can be transcribed without resulting in 98 premature termination. Therefore, a novel signal or mechanism may be involved in allowing polycistronic 99 transcription and termination in kinetoplastids. Two chromatin factors, base J and histone H3 variant 100 (H3.V), have recently been shown to have an impact on Pol II termination in kinetoplastids. Base J is a .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 101 modified DNA base found in kinetoplastids where the glucose moiety, linked via oxygen to the thymine 102 base, resides in the major groove of DNA (reviewed in (19)). In T. brucei and Leishmania major, J and 103 H3.V are enriched at sites involved in Pol II termination (20-23). This includes sites within polycistronic 104 gene clusters where (premature) termination silences downstream genes. Loss of J or H3.V leads to 105 read-through transcription (21-26). At PTU internal termination sites this leads to increased expression of 106 the downstream genes. This epigenetic regulation of termination is thought to allow developmentally 107 regulated expression of specific transcriptionally silent genes. In T. brucei, this includes the expression of 108 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes involved in antigenic variation during bloodstream infections.
It is currently unclear how these epigenetic marks are involved in Pol II termination, since very 110 little is understood regarding the mechanism of Pol II termination in kinetoplastids. Equally unclear is what 111 regulates the specific localization of these marks, including base J, in the genome. Base J is synthesized 112 in a two-step pathway in which a thymidine hydroxylase (TH), JBP1 or JBP2, hydroxylates thymidine 113 residues at specific positions in DNA to form hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) (27), followed by the transfer of 114 glucose to hmU by the glucosyltransferase, JGT (28, 29) (reviewed in (19, 30)). The TH enzymes, JBP1 115 and JBP2, contain a TH domain at the N-terminus (27, 31-34). JBP1 has a J-DNA binding domain in the 116 C-terminal half of the protein that is able to bind synthetic J-DNA substrates in vitro and bind chromatin in 117 a J-dependent manner in vivo (35-38). The ability of JBP1 to bind J-DNA is thought to play a role in J 118 propagation and maintenance. JBP2 does not bind the modified base directly, but is able to bind 119 chromatin in a base J independent manner, presumably via the C-terminal SWI2/SNF2 domain (31, 35). 120 The JGT lacks DNA sequence specificity, and can convert hmU to base J in vivo regardless of where it is 121 present (39-41). This and other analysis of J synthesis indicate that JBP1 and JBP2 are the key 122 regulatory enzymes of J synthesis.
In this study, we identify a new J-binding protein (called JBP3) in kinetoplastids that is present in 124 a complex containing PP1, Wdr82 and a putative orthologue of PNUTS. To characterize the role of this 125 (PJW/PP1) complex in transcription termination, we investigated the consequence of mutants using RNAi 126 in T. brucei. Ablation of JBP3, Wdr82 or PNUTS in T. brucei causes read-through transcription at 127 termination sites. As we previously demonstrated following the removal of base J and H3.V, these defects 128 include transcription read-through at termination sites within Pol II transcribed gene arrays and the silent 129 Pol I transcribed VSG expression sites, leading to de-repression of genes involved in parasite .

Furthermore, ablation of JBP3, Wdr82 or PNUTS results in expression of genes upstream 131 of Pol II transcription start sites presumably representing a previously unappreciated role of termination of 132 antisense transcription from gene promoters in trypanosomes. Overall these findings provide a first look 133 at mechanisms involved in Pol II transcription termination in kinetoplastids and a direct link between base 134 J and termination.

Affinity purification and identification of JGT-associated proteins in Leishmania
In this study, we chose to identify the proteins that co-purify with JBP1, JBP2 and JGT, in order to 139 understand the regulation of J-biosynthesis. Leishmania tarentolae was chosen as an experimental 140 system, because it provides an easily grown source of high densities of parasites that synthesize base J. 141 The proteins were cloned into the pSNSAP1 vector, carrying a C-terminal tag composed of a protein A 142 domain, the TEV protease cleavage site, and the streptavidin binding peptide (42). Purification of the 143 complexes was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Separation of the final eluate from the 144 JGT tagged cell line by SDS-PAGE and staining of the proteins by SYPRO Ruby, revealed a dominant
145 protein band of ~120 kDa, representing JGT-S and several co-purified protein bands ( Fig 1A) . As a 146 control, no specific proteins were identified from the purification from untagged wildtype cells. In contrast, 147 and unexpectedly, no co-purified proteins were identified from the JBP1-S or JBP2-S purification either by 148 SDS-PAGE or mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, we continued the analysis on the JGT purification.
149 Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the JGT-S purification revealed a total 150 of five unique proteins not present in the negative control purification (Table 1) . These proteins were 151 required to have at least two unique peptides and a Seaquest score of at least 100. As expected, JGT-S 152 was recovered in the eluate. However, four additional potential JGT associated proteins were discovered 153 with (hypothetical) molecular masses of 74, 42 and 29 kDa. One of these JGT-interacting proteins (42 154 kDa; LtaP15.0230) was protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which contains a PP1 catalytic domain (Fig 1B) .
155 The other 42-kDa protein (LtaP32.3990) contains three WD repeat domains and has been identified as a 156 homologue of Wdr82/Swd2 (human/yeast). The remaining two JGT interacting proteins had not been .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 previously characterized. We named the 74-kDa protein JBP3 (LtaP36.0380) because it has a domain 158 with homology to the base J DNA binding domain of JBP1 (Fig 1B and S1 ) and we demonstrate its ability 159 to bind J-DNA (see below). The 29-kDa JGT interacting protein was named PNUTS (LtaP33.1440) since 160 it contains a conserved RVxF PP1 interactive domain (Fig 1C and S2 Fig) within an apparent intrinsically 161 disordered region of the protein and is a part of a complex similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans 162 (where JBP3 may represent a functional homolog of Tox4). PP1 interactive proteins such as PNUTS are 163 highly disordered in their unbound state and fall in a group of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (4-6). 164 This intrinsic flexibility is important for the formation of extensive interactions with PP1 (6, 43, 44). A 165 bioinformatics analysis using the DISOPRED3 program (45, 46), which scores for the occurrence of 166 disorder-inducing amino acids, predicts a majority of TbPNUTS is disordered (S2 Fig). Similarly, the 167 Compositional profiler (47) shows PNUTS is enriched in major disorder-promoting residues and depleted 168 in major order-promoting residues. This inherent disorder may explain why TbPNUTS migrates slower in 169 SDS-PAGE than predicted (see S3A Fig). To confirm the complex, we subsequently performed tandem 170 affinity purifications with tagged JBP3 and Wdr82. Reciprocal purification of JBP3 and Wdr82 resulted in 171 the identification of JGT, PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 with a significant number of unique peptide hits 172 (Table 1 ). These data indicate that in Leishmania JGT associates with a protein complex composed of 173 PNUTS, PP1, JBP3 and Wdr82 similar to the PTW/PP1 complex in humans, shown to be involved in 174 transcription termination (Fig 1F) . While JBP3 may be a functional homologue of the human Tox4 DNA 175 binding protein (see below), JBP3 appears to be conserved only in the genus trypanosome. Based on this 176 similarity, we now refer to this complex as PJW/PP1 in Leishmania. 177 178 Fig 1. Identification of a novel phosphatase complex in Leishmania tarentolae. (A) Proteins 179 recovered from tandem affinity purification from wild-type L. tarentolae extracts (WT) and from cells 180 expressing the strep-tagged version of JGT, were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Sypro 181 Ruby. (B) Summary of the PJW/PP1 complex. The domain structure of each component in the complex is 182 schematically shown. JBD, J-DNA binding domain; RVxF motif, PP1 docking motif; PP1c, catalytic 183 domain of protein phosphatase 1; WD40, WD40 repeat. The number of amino acids in each component is 184 indicated. (C) Structure-based sequence alignment of the PNUTS, spinophilin PP1 and NIPP1 interactive 185 domains in humans is compared with LtPNUTS (residues 95-112) and TbPNUTS (residues 139-164), 213 models generated by the comparative modeling program I-TASSER (48, 49) were of high quality, with 214 TM-score value of 0.727. The sequence identity and similar domain composition to the JBD of JBP1
215 supported our contention that the LtaP36.0380 protein is a J-binding protein, subsequently named JBP3.
We have previously developed a rapid isolation procedure for His-tagged recombinant JBP1 217 produced in E. coli and gel shift assays to characterize J-DNA binding activities (37, 38). We utilized a 218 similar approach to characterize JBP3 in vitro DNA binding activity. The recombinant JBP3 obtained, as 219 judged by its appearance in Coomassie-stained gels (Fig 1D) , was suitable for investigating the specific 220 interaction of JBP3 and J-modified DNA (J-DNA). To determine the ability of JBP3 to bind J-DNA, we 221 used the gel shift assay to investigate the binding of JBP3 to J-DNA duplex (VSG-1J) that has a single 222 centrally located J modification compared with the same duplex without any base J (VSG-T). The J-DNA 223 substrate was incubated with increasing amounts of JBP3 protein, and the complex was analyzed on 224 native gels. The results of the gel shift assay in Fig 1E, show that the amount of free J-DNA decreases 225 with increasing concentrations of JBP3, concomitant with formation of the JBP3/J-DNA complex. In 226 contrast, incubation of the unmodified DNA substrate with the highest concentration of JBP3 resulted in 227 no visible complex. Thus, JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. 228 229 Characterization of the putative phosphatase complex containing Wdr82, JBP3 230 and PNUTS in T. brucei
To study the function of the PJW/PP1 complex in vivo, we switched to T. brucei due to the 232 benefits of forward and reverse genetics available in this system. However, while all other components 233 are easily identified (see Tables 1 and 2) , a PP1 homologue identified in the Leishmania PJW/PP1 234 complex is not present in the T. brucei genome (50, 51). To characterize the complex in T. brucei, and 235 identify the TbPP1 protein component, we used a TAP tagging approach with a PTP epitope tag (52) to 236 identify TbPNUTS-interacting proteins. We generated a clonal procyclic form (PF) T. brucei cell line 237 expressing a C-terminal PTP-tagged TbPNUTS protein from its endogenous locus. This cell line was 238 used for the TAP procedure. Briefly, a crude protein extract was first purified by IgG affinity 239 chromatography, and the TEV protease was used to cleave off the Protein A portion of the PTP tag. .

Furthermore, JGT does not co-purify when PNUTS, JBP3 or Wdr82 is pulled down (S3B 266 Fig), nor does Hsp70 co-purify when PNUTS or JBP3 is pulled down (S3C Fig).

Mapping TSSs using tri-461 phosphate RNA-seq has previously suggested bi-directional activity, with strong strand bias, of Pol II 462 initiation sites in T. brucei (66, 67). The RNA-seq data presented here is consistent with bi-directional 463 activity of TSS, early termination and stimulation of divergent antisense transcription in the PNUTS .

As shown in Fig   465 5A and B, the silent 8340 gene within a dSSR on chromosome 10 is transcribed upon the loss of 466 TbPNUTS. To see whether there is a correlation between the initiation of the antisense transcript with 467 sense mRNA coding strand TSS, we analyzed the 5'-end of the nascent antisense transcript at this dSSR 468 using RT-PCR (Fig 5C) . The significant drop of inability of a 5' primer to amplify the cDNA corresponding 469 to the nascent 'antisense' transcript indicates the 5' end of the PNUTS regulated transcript is adjacent to 470 the TSS for the sense transcript on the opposing strand. Using various 3' primers for generating cDNA, 471 antisense transcription is attenuated in uninduced cells as shown in the decline in cDNA with increasing 472 length of the transcript (Fig 5D) . In the absence of PNUTS the antisense transcription fails to terminate, 473 as seen in the maintained levels of cDNA for all primers tested in + Tet. The increasing effects of the loss 474 of PNUTS on level of transcript with increasing length of the transcript supports the idea of PNUTS 475 regulating early termination/elongation of the antisense transcript. Taken together the results suggest that 476 the PJW/PP1 complex (PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82) regulates premature termination of antisense 477 transcription from bi-directional TSS and silencing of gene expression in T. brucei.
Another possibility is that increased transcription within dSSRs is due to transcription initiating 479 upstream of the divergent TSSs in the absence of PNUTS. To address this possibility, we examined 480 transcription at Head-to-Head (HT) boundaries of PTUs. HT sites are defined where transcription of one 481 PTU terminates and transcription of another PTU on the same DNA strand initiates. In contrast to TSSs at 482 dSSRs, HT sites contain a termination site for the upstream PTU, indicated by H3.V and H4.V, and a TSS 483 marked by individual peaks of histone variants, such as H2A.Z, and histone modifications (22, 66, 67).
484 Similar to the metaplot analyses of dSSRs and cSSRs, we detected accumulation of transcripts at HT 485 sites upon the ablation of PNUTS (Fig 4D) . At these non-divergent TSSs, the region upstream of the start 486 site produced more transcripts in the PNUTS mutant indicating readthrough transcription, as expected, or 487 possible initiating events further upstream. More interestingly, antisense transcripts are also increased at 488 HT sites. The lack of a divergent TSS at these sites, indicated by the presence of single peak of H2A.Z, 489 supports the conclusion that the antisense transcripts are the result of regulated bi-directional 490 transcription activity.

Our previous studies on base J/H3.V function revealed regulated transcription termination 598 at the 3'-end of PTUs as a novel mechanism of gene expression control in kinetoplastids.

240 Subsequently, the TEV protease eluate underwent anti-Protein C affinity purification, and the final purified 241 products were eluted with EGTA. The concentrated proteins were then trypsin-digested and analyzed by 242 LC-MS/MS. As a control, we analyzed the eluate of a comparable purification of extract from wild-type T. 243 brucei. As expected, TbPNUTS was identified along with Wdr82 and JBP3 (Table 2) 
To further characterize the PNUTS complex, extracts recovered from T. brucei cells expressing 279 epitope-tagged components were analyzed by western blot following sucrose fractionation. Analysis of T.
280 brucei cells expressing PTP-PNUTS and HA-JBP3 or HA-Wdr82 indicate Wdr82, JBP3 and PNUTS co-281 migrate at <200kDa. These results indicate that JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a stable complex of 282 <200kDa. Summation of the predicted size of the three complex components (~180 kDa) agrees with the 283 observed mass of the PJW complex and suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry for the subunits. Taken together, 284 data from co-immunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient analysis, and identification of PNUTS-, Wdr82-, and 285 JBP3-associated proteins by mass spectrometry indicate that Wdr82, JBP3 and PNUTS comprise a 286 stable PJW complex in kinetoplastids ( Fig 1F) . In contrast to the complex in Leishmania, the stable 287 purified T. brucei complex lacks both JGT and PP1.
LtPP1 is found to be stably associated in PJW/PP1 complex, possibly through its putative PP1-289 interacting protein, PNUTS. PNUTS is present in both the T. brucei and Leishmania complex and share a 290 conserved RVxF motif ( Fig 1C) . Moreover, a similar human PTW/PP1 complex suggests that PP1 confers 291 the complex phosphatase activity critical for its regulation in Pol II termination (2, 3, 53, 54). The apparent 292 lack of PP1 in the T. brucei complex is therefore surprising. To identify the TbPP1 component, we directly 293 tested two of the eight PP1 genes in T. brucei for interactions with the complex by co-IP. PP1-1 has the 294 highest sequence homology to the PP1 involved in termination in yeast and humans (51). PP1-7 has .

However, neither of these PP1 proteins associate with 296 TbPNUTS in the co-IP (S3C Fig). Alternatively, PP1 is not stably associated with the complex in T. brucei.
297 This is consistent with one of three replicates of LtJGT purification that resulted in all components of the 298 complex except PP1 (S1 Table) , suggesting PP1 is the least stable component of the Leishmania 299 complex. It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Ser residue(s) within or close to the RVxF 300 motif of PP1 regulatory subunits, including PNUTS, disrupts the binding of this motif to PP1 (56-59).

We also detect evidence of read-through transcription at the 327 representative PTU internal termination site on chromosome 5 upon ablation of the three factors. RT-PCR 328 using oligos flanking the termination site (see diagram, Fig 3A) detects increased RNA upon ablation of 329 PNUTS, Wdr82 and JBP3 ( Fig 3C) . As a control a separate RT-PCR utilized the same 5' primer and a 3' 330 primer immediately upstream of the termination site. We have previously shown that an RNA species 331 spanning the termination site is indicative of read-through transcription and is only detected following the 332 loss of base J or H3.V, due to continued transcription elongation at termination sites (21, 24, 25).
333 Consistent with read-through transcription, both genes downstream of the termination site are significantly 334 de-repressed upon the ablation of the three components of the PJW/PP1 complex, in contrast to genes 335 upstream ( Fig 3D) . In contrast, no significant termination defects are detected upon ablation of a negative 336 control, acidocalcisome VA a protein (Fig 3 C and D) . VA a has been shown to be an essential gene in T.
337 brucei and ablation results in similar growth defects as seen in PJW/PP1 complex (60) (Fig 3B) . Table) . 364 The location of the genes with >3-fold upregulation was mapped (Fig 4A and S5 ). Interestingly, these 365 genes were closely located at regions flanking PTUs or subtelomeric regions, suggesting a role of 366 PNUTS in genome-wide transcription, specifically at transcription initiation and termination sites, as well 367 as subtelomeres. The PTU flanking regions represent transcription termination sites (TTS) and 368 transcription start sites (TSS) within the so-called convergent strand switch region (cSSR) and divergent 369 strand switch region (dSSR), respectively. We have previously shown that base J is localized within the 370 cSSRs and dSSRs flanking PTUs and involved in Pol II termination. Therefore, we wanted to first confirm 371 the association with J at termination sites with changes in gene expression we observed in the PNUTS The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint 408 borders of PTUs, including downstream of normal transcription termination sites at the 3'-end. To take a 409 closer look at the increased level of transcripts at these sites, and determine whether they are due to 410 transcriptional readthrough, forward and reverse reads mapping to 5kb flanking and within cSSRs were 411 counted and RPKM values were generated. As shown in Fig 4B, 
Based on the initial RT-PCR analysis of the internal termination site in PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 424 knockdowns (Fig 3) , we expected RNA-seq to illustrate defects in termination at 3'-end of PTUs genome-425 wide in the PNUTS mutant. However, we also detected accumulation of transcripts at dSSRs, illustrated 426 by the genome-wide map of transcript levels (S6 Fig) and the metaplot of dSSRs (Fig 4C and S7 Fig) . At 427 these divergent TSSs, the region upstream of the start site produced more transcripts in the PNUTS 428 mutant when forward and reverse reads were analyzed separately, indicating that transcription initiates 429 upstream of its start site upon the loss of PNUTS. In some cases, this leads to expression of genes 430 present in the dSSR that are silent in WT cells. This explains the mapping of genes upregulated in the 431 PNUTS mutant to 5'-end PTUs (Fig 4A) .

In addition to Pol II termination sites distributed throughout the T. brucei genome, H3.V and base 519 J localize within the ~14 Pol I transcribed polycistronic units located at the telomeric ends and involved in 520 antigenic variation (so called bloodstream form VSG expression sites, BESs) ( Fig 6A)(19, 75-77 ).
521 Monoallelic expression of a VSG ES leads to the expression of a single VSG on the surface of the 522 parasite, a key aspect of the strategy bloodstream form trypanosomes use to evade the host immune 523 system. We have previously shown that the loss of H3.V and J leads to increased expression of VSG 524 genes from silent telomeric BESs (21). This effect is presumably due to the role of these epigenetic marks 525 in attenuating transcription elongation Pol I within the silent VSG BESs, thereby preventing the 526 transcription of silent VSGs. Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-seq reads mapped to the 427 527 genome indicates that the loss of PNUTS leads to increased VSG expression from silent BESs (S2 Table) . Table and S5 Fig). In the VSGnome, these (unknown) VSGs ( Fig 6B) were thought to 542 be primarily located at subtelomeric arrays, but their exact positioning in the genome was not known (78). 
The derepression of ESAG 6 and 7 genes adjacent to the BES promoter along with the VSG ~40 566 kb downstream (S2 Table) , suggests that PJW/PP1 may function throughout the telomeric PTU. To 567 examine this more closely, we analyzed the RNA-seq reads mapping to the 14 telomeric BES sequences 568 (80). RNA-seq reads mapping to BES were counted in 200bp windows with a 100bp steps. Read counts 569 were converted into reads per million (RPM) and compared between +/-Tet to estimate log2 fold change 570 and plotted in Fig 7C and S11 Fig. The location of BES promoters is indicated by an arrow. The 571 transcription of the active BES1 was not affected by the loss of TbPNUTS. However, when the remaining 572 13 silent BESs are analyzed we see derepression of ESAGs as well as the terminal VSG. In some cases, 573 it seems that derepression extends 10-20 kb from the promoter to express ESAG 6 and 7, with no .

In other cases there is selective upregulation of the VSG gene, including the pseudo VSGs 576 that are present upstream of some telomeric VSGs. The apparent selective VSG upregulation may be 577 due to the combined effect of low level transcription of the entire BES and enhanced stability of VSG 578 mRNAs. For example, the increased VSG mRNA half-life (4.5 hrs) compared with ESAG 6 and 7 (1.8-2.8 579 hrs) (81, 82). Transcripts of genes located approximately 5 kb upstream of the VSG have also been 580 shown to be selectively rapidly degraded, presumably by nonsense-mediated decay (83). We also 581 noticed that increased levels of RNA close to the promoter are significantly higher when there is an 582 additional BES promoter upstream for ESAG10. In fact, the most significant gene expression changes are 583 in BESs that have dual promoters (S2 Table) . These data would suggest derepression of telomere-584 proximal VSG genes after PNUTS depletion is due to transcriptional activation of silent Pol I promoters. 585 However, these results are also consistent with increased Pol I elongation along the BES. Repression of 586 silent ESs is mediated at least in part by the inhibition of Pol I elongation within the BES preventing the 587 production of VSG mRNA from the silent BESs (84-86). Similar to its inhibition of Pol II transcription 588 elongation at termination sites at the 5' and 3' end of PTUs genome-wide, PNUTS may also function at 589 telomeric regions to attenuate Pol I transcription elongation within the silent ESs. The data here suggest 590 PJW/PP1 controls VSG silencing at BESs by regulating Pol I elongation (termination) and/or regulating 591 access of the polymerase to silent promoter regions.
Discussion 594 841 carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues and a variable modification of oxidation on methionine 842 residues were enabled to accurately match fragment ions. A fixed value peptide spectral match (PSM) 843 validation node was used to validate each PSM at a maximum delta Cn of 0.05. All PSMs were subjected 844 to further validation with a maximum of 1% false discovery rate utilizing PSMs matched to a reverse 845 (decoy) database while being assigned to protein groups. The L. tarentolae JBP3 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with primers containing 5' 860 Nde I and 3' BamH I restriction sites. PCR fragments were digested with Nde I and BamH I and 861 subcloned into the pet16b expression vector. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21 862 DE3), and bacteria were cultured in defined autoinduction media to allow growing cultures to high 863 densities and protein expression without induction, as previously described (121). Briefly, LB media is 864 supplemented with KH 2 PO 4 , Na 2 HPO 4 and 0.05% Glucose, 0.2% Lactose and 0.6% Glycerol. Bacteria 865 were cultured in this media in the presence of 100g/ml ampicillin at 37 O C for 2 h and then shifted to 866 18 O C for 24 h. Cells were lysed and JBP3 purified by metal affinity as previously described for JBP1 (37, .
