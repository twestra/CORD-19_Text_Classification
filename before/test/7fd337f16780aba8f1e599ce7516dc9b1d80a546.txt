To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 .
DESIGN
Retrospective case series
Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals
Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.
Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 All rights reserved.

Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
In December 2019, many unexplained pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread to other parts of China, then to Europe, North America and Asia. This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) [1] . 2019-nCov was reported to have symptoms resembled that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [2] . Both shared the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3] . Therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2, and recently WHO named it coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Until February 21 th 2020, there were 75569 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2239 deaths in China [4] .
Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections or injuries in various animals [5] . However, some of them can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, such as in the cases of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), causing epidemics or pandemics. Infection in human often leads to severe clinical symptoms and high mortality [6] . As for COVID-19, several studies have described clinical manifestations including respiratory symptoms, myalgia and fatigue. COVID-19 also has characteristic laboratory findings and lung CT abnormalities [7] . However, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurological manifestations.
Here, we would like to report the characteristic neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 78 of 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and treated at our hospitals, which are located in the epicenter of Wuhan.

All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the WHO interim guideline [8] . Only those cases confirmed by a positive result to real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay from throat swab specimens were included in the analysis [9] . Union Hospital, located in the endemic areas of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, is one of the major tertiary healthcare system and teaching hospitals responsible for the treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection as designated by the government. The study was performed in accordance to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Verbal consent was obtained from patients before the enrollment.
The demographic characteristics, medical history, symptoms, clinical signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan findings were extracted from electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians.
Neurological symptoms were categorized into three main areas: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or disease, peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms and muscular symptoms. Acute cerebrovascular disease included ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. Muscle injury was defined when a patient had myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase level above 200 U/L [7] . All neurological symptoms were reviewed and confirmed by two trained neurologists. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. The severity of COVID-19 was defined by the international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [10] .

SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd).
Continuous variables were described as means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile range (IQR) values. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages. Continuous variables were compared by using the unpaired Wilcox rank-sum test. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test.
All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.0) software. The significance threshold was set at a P<0.05.
A total of 214 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the present analysis. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in Table 1 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This is the first report on detailed neurologic manifestations of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. As of February 19, 2020, of 214 patients included in this study, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe. Of these, 78 (36.4%) had various neurologic manifestations involved CNS, PNS and skeletal muscles. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older and had more hypertension but less with typical symptoms such as fever and cough. Severe patients were more likely to develop neurological symptoms, especially acute cerebrovascular All rights reserved.

Therefore, for patients with COVID-19, we need to pay close attention to their neurologic manifestations, especially for those with severe infectons, which may have contributed to their demise. Moreover, during the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with these neurologic manifestations, doctors should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis so to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.
Recently, ACE2 is identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3] , which is present in multiple human organs, including nervous system and skeletal muscle [11] . The expression and distribution of ACE2 remind us that the SARS-CoV-2 may cause some neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms.
the cerebrospinal fluid of those patients and also in their brain tissue on autopsy [12] [13] .
CNS symptoms were the main form of neurological injury in patients with COVID-19 in this study. The pathological mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS virus. Like other respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had hyposmia. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of the immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms, especially in the severe subgroup. Moreover, we found severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than All rights reserved.

Consistent with the previous studies [7] muscle symptom was also common in our study. We speculate that the symptom was due to skeletal muscle injury, as confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels. We found that patients with muscle symptoms had higher creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels than those without muscle symptoms. Furthermore, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels in severe patients were much higher than those of none-severe patients. This injure could be related to ACE2 in skeletal muscle [14] . However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination [15] .
Therefore, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects skeletal muscle cells by binding with ACE2 requires to be further studied. One other reason was the infection-mediated harmful immune response that caused the nervous system abnormalities. Significantly In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may infect nervous system, skeletal muscle as well as respiratory tract. In those with severe infection, neurological involvement is more All rights reserved.

Involvement of the nervous system carries a poor prognosis.
Their clinical conditions may worsen and patients may die soon. Therefore, for patient with COVID19, physicians should pay close attention to any neurologic manifestations in addition to the symptoms of respiratory system. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
