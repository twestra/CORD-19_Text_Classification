The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted.
The COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly in the first months of the 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 th of March declared a global pandemic [1] . COVID-19 symptoms are often (80%) mild [2] , may appear 2-14 days after exposure (mean incubation period 5-6 days) [2] , and include fever, cough and shortness of breath [3] . However the 13.8% of infected have severe disease and the 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2] . Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [2] . In the severe and critical disease, the patient admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary and the mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), may be required [4] . This special treatment is the bottle neck of most of the health care systems, which are not prepared to deal with the numbers of patients that the COVID-19 disease could produce. Therefore, measures of containment of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are essential to not overstress the health care systems and to manage the pandemic.
almost 60 million of people under lockdown, were defined "unprecedented in public health history" by the WHO.
Unfortunately, these measures were not able to stop the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, which caused several outbreaks around the globe. These drastic measures, also adopted by other EU countries, apart from the health sector, have a dramatic impact on the global economy as well as on the lifestyle habits of millions of people. Epidemiologic descriptions and predictions could help in the understanding of the dynamic of the COVID-19 disease, supporting governments and health authorities in the resources allocation [5] . Most of the models proposed until now to describe the COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the scarcely data available of a still ongoing epidemic, are heuristic models. These models are "fitting" equation, exponential [5] or logistic [6] , used to describe the infection data, whose parameters have scarce (or none) physical meaning and their use for prediction, especially at long term, should be avoided. On the contrary compartmental models could constitute the right trade-off between the need of having physical based parameters, the easiness of solution and the scarce presence of data in the evolving epidemic. Typically, the population of interest is subdivided into a small number of compartments based on infection status (e.g. susceptible, infectious or recovered) and the flows between these compartments are described by ordinary differential equations [7] . Aim of this work is to develop a compartmental model (SIRD) to describe first the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic and then, by perturbation of the model parameters, to describe and predict the Italian COVID-19 epidemic.
In compartmental models the population under study is divided into compartments and, with assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics, the movements of people within the compartments can be described. In particular with "SIRD" model a four compartments model is indicated, where "S" indicates the "Susceptible" compartment, "I" specifies the "Infected" compartment, "R" denotes the "Recovered" compartment and "D" identifies the "Death" compartment, as schematized in Figure 1 . Schematization of the SIRD model. "S" indicates the "Susceptible" compartment, "I" specifies the "Infected" compartment, "R" denotes the "Recovered" compartment and "D" identifies the "Death" compartment.
It is assumed that the total population of reference is constant (N= 60 million), meaning that in the considered time period the rate of birth and death (including the one related to the COVID-19) are equal [8] . This is particularly true for low lethality diseases with very large outbreaks (like a whole nation). It is also assumed that recovered people cannot be re-infected [9] . The ordinary differential equations, with their initial conditions, describing the movements of people from one compartment to the other are reported in the eq. (1) (2) (3) (4) .

The transmission rate is most of the time used as fitting parameter to describe the epidemiologic data. In this case, with the lockdown protocol taken by the governments, the number of contacts per person per unit time can dramatically decrease during the epidemic. In this work the kinetic of infection was described with an exponential function: 
Where ! is the recovery kinetic at time zero, ! + & is the recovery kinetic at regime, which is reached after ' days of adaptation.
The kinetic of death , especially for new diseases, it is not constant and decreases with time, luckily. This is due to the adaptation of the pathogen, whose less lethal strains tend to be the most spread, as well as due to the development of new clinical treatments. Moreover, at the beginning of an epidemic usually the severe cases are observed first and the overall rate of dying appears to decrease when less severe cases are added. In this work an exponential decay function was used to describe this evolution:
Where ( ! + & ) is the initial death rate, which decreases substantially (90%) at = 3 ( , and reaches a long-term lethality rate & .
In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (ℛ ! )
of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection [10] .
When ℛ ! > 1 the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if ℛ ! < 1. Generally, the larger the value of ℛ ! , the harder it is to control the epidemic.
The reproduction number can be obtained from the SIR model dividing Eq 2 by the total population N [11] :
Where is the normalized number of infected people (I⁄ ). An epidemic occurs if the number of infected individuals increases, di dt ⁄ > 0, which means that the reproduction number (ℛ) has to be greater than the unity:
At the outset of an epidemic, nearly everyone is susceptible, so that S(0)/N~1, but S(t)/N~1 is also true for very large population with relatively low percentage of total cases: All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

If the kinetic of infection β is higher than the sum of the kinetic of recovery γ and death δ, than the outbreak is epidemic, with ℛ ! >1. On the contrary if β is small compared to the γ + δ than ℛ ! <1 and the outbreak is destined to extinguish.

With this approach the effects of outliers (|ε + | > k) is The global objective function was minimized with application of gradient-based method (fmincon) first, followed by a step of minimization with a gradient-free algorithm (pattern-search), followed by a third step of gradient-based method. The use of these three steps was necessary to reach global minima. The model describing the Italian outbreak is available at the reference [13] .
The Hubei outbreak can be considered a closed system since the lockdown measure, which isolated the province Health [15] . However, the data reported in [14] for the Italian case are retrieved from [15] , making the use of both the databases interchangeable.

In particular for Figure 2B ) the "cumulative" correspond to the total number of people that belong to the infected compartment ( Figure 1 ): people that have been infected but are not recovered or death yet.
It is also useful to obtain the incident cases (new daily cases) which for the recovered people and the deaths is the derivative of their respective cumulative cases, whereas to obtain the incident infection the derivative of the total cases Figure 2 A) has to be performed.
From the experimental data this can be done calculating the incremental ratio of the cumulative cases.
Being the minimum time span equal to 1 day, in this case the incremental ratio is equal to the difference between two adjacent points of the cumulative curves.

The Chinese outbreak of COVID-19, at the end of its development, can be used to understand the dynamic of COVID-19 disease. The model parameters obtained for the description of the Chinese outbreak were perturbated to describe the initial Italian outbreak and to predict its evolution.
The SIRD model results for the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak are reported in Figure 3 . The model parameters (8 parameters) were fitted on the experimental data, obtaining a satisfactorily description of the epidemiologic data published so far. It is interesting to analyzed the value of the obtained modeling parameters, reported in Table 1 perpetuity.

This seems to prove that the observed and reported cases in Italy, especially in the first period, were mostly severe cases. However, the addition of mild cases could produce in the following days and increase in the rate of recovery, generating also a quicker reduction of the infected patients.
The seriousness of the Italian COVID-19 cases can be seen also looking at the death kinetic, which is initially ( ! ) 2.5 times greater than the Chinese and also slower in the decrease (higher ( ), as it can be seen in Figure 6 A) (black dotted line). This caused many deaths in Italy (>20,000) and many other are expected, overcoming 30,000 cases. The higher lethality could be due to the However further studies should be performed to investigate such a high lethality, i.e. in [23] it is suggested that the reasons could be found in the Italian extensive intergenerational contacts, which are supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and their parents. Other reasons, such as the careless management of the elderly in nursing homes is an ongoing political and criminal debate.
Such severe impact of the virus SARS-CoV-2 on the Italian would not have been expected looking at the initial reproduction number (Figure 6 B) ). The lower infection kinetic recorded in Italy generated an initial ℛ ! of 6 (way lower than the Chinese). However, ℛ ! decreased slower due to the retarded lockdown (constant value in (Figure 6 B) The Italian outbreak, still in the peak region, has showed stable death and recovery kinetic over the past 30 days, indeed fitting backward in time the Italian data the parameters ! , ! , ( result quite stable. The most important parameter, which causes the retardation of the decreasing phase of the epidemic is the characteristic time % in the infection kinetic. The higher % , the longer it will take to reduce the number of cases (the longer it will take to reach ℛ ! <1). In Figure 7 the impact of the variation of % is reported on incident cases. With the blue solid thick line the "best fit" value (used in this work) is reported. However, as it can be seen from the experimental data, the epidemiologic data are prone to be describe with other characteristic time of infection % , especially higher than the present "best fit" value. Therefore, depending on the new infection of the next days the peak could slightly translate, however with limited impact on the deaths count. All rights reserved.

The understanding of the dynamic of the epidemic could be useful to take decisions in time, preparing hospitals to deal with the infection peak. The ongoing outbreaks are often described with simple fitting models, i.e. exponential functions (and/or sigma-shaped curves such as Logistic or Gompertz), whereas in this work, a SIRD compartmental model was developed and used to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese (Hubei) and of the Italian outbreaks. The advantages of SIRD models with respect to heuristic models reside mainly in the physical-based SIRD parameters, which can give useful insight and/or can be properly chosen on the basis of physical-based assumptions. The present SIRD model was able to describe the outbreaks, obtaining the kinetic of infection, the kinetic of recovery as well as the kinetic of death. The Italian best fit initial kinetic of infection was lower (half) than the Chinese one, probably because the Italian outbreaks are mainly based in small hospitals/cities, whereas the main Chinese outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan. However, the decrease time of this kinetic in the Italian outbreak was slower than in the Chinese outbreak, probably due to the delayed lockdown and initial weaker restrictions. Therefore, despite a lower average ℛ ! , 3.9 in Italy versus 8.3 in Hubei, the longer Italian epidemic produced much more COVID-19 cases.
The Italian epidemic showed a higher death kinetic, causing at the end of infection 10 times the Chinese deaths (modeling results). This, along with a very slow recovery kinetic, proved that most of the reported cases in Italy are related to severe infections, therefore the epidemiologic data could be highly underestimated in the total number of cases as well as in the recovered cases.
On the contrary, according to the data released so far, the Draconian lockdown measures taken by the Chinese government have been more effective, extinguishing in 1 month an outbreak that was potentially more dangerous than the Italian one.
