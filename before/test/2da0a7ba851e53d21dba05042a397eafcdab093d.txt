With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to 8 prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV). Previously, groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a 11 conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, 16 combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, 18 and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.

Targeting both conserved coronavirus activities produced a stable, attenuated virus capable of 80 protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and absence of reversion in 81 immunocompromised models. Together, the results indicate that targeting coronavirus NSP16 82 may be a critical component of a future live attenuated coronavirus vaccine approach. 83 84 .

Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response 23 vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV 24 vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions 25 and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised. This study 26 illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for 27 pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy.
Importantly, the NSP16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide 29 robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations. Coupled with 30 increased safety and reduced pathogenesis, the study highlights the potential for NSP16
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the 34 beginning of the 21st century signaled a new era for emergent viral disease (1). Since then, 35 dozens of viruses have emerged from animal populations to produce significant outbreaks in 36 humans and transfer of zoonotic pathogens remains a major threat to global public health (2). A 37 decade after SARS-CoV, infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-38 CoV) continue with periodic reintroductions still occurring six years after its initial discovery (3).
Coupled with recently discovered SARS-and MERS-like coronaviruses circulating in animal 40 populations, the threat of a coronavirus fueled outbreak remains far from remote (4). With this 41 in mind, strategies must be developed to rapidly respond to a potential CoV emergence or 42 reemergence event.
While the SARS-and to a lesser extent the MERS-CoV outbreaks have been mostly 44 contained, this limitation has been primarily due to effective public health measures and the 45 delayed transmissibility of the viruses until after symptomatic disease (5). Standard antiviral 46 treatments with type I IFN or traditional nucleoside analogs like ribavirin have shown minimal 47 success against either epidemic strain (6). While several antibodies have been designed 48 against SARS-and MERS-CoV, their efficacy has been found to be strain specific and may offer 49 minimal protection against heterologous or unrelated coronaviruses, especially under 50 therapeutic conditions (4, 7). Other drugs, targeting conserved CoV activities, have had either 51 marginal efficacy in vivo or offer only a small window for treatment during early infection (8, 9) .
Similar to other viral infections, the most effective treatment for coronaviruses is prevention via 53 vaccination.
In the context of both the SARS-and MERS-CoV outbreaks, a wealth of vaccine 55 strategies have been developed and examined (10, 11). Many have utilized sub-unit based 56 approaches; others have used virus like particles or other vector systems to induce immunity.
While less desirable for both commercial and safety reasons, a number of live attenuated 58 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/309591 doi: bioRxiv preprint strains have also been developed targeting both conserved CoV elements or specific 59 approaches that may be strain or group dependent (12, 13) . For many of these vaccine 60 approaches, protection from homologous challenge was noted following in vivo vaccination of 61 young animals (10, 11). However, the failure of non-infectious vaccines in regards to 62 heterologous challenge and in aged mice signaled a major issue in their use in vulnerable 63 populations most impacted by coronavirus disease (14, 15 
In this manuscript, we expand upon a live-attenuated vaccine approach based on 69 mutation of coronavirus NSP16, a 2'O methyl-transferase. Previous work in murine hepatitis 70 virus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have found that disruption of NSP16 activity rendered an 71 attenuated strain sensitive to the activity of interferon stimulated IFIT1 (18) (19) (20) . Work by our 72 group went on to show that NSP16 mutants provided protection from lethal challenge by both 73 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in young animals (19, 20) . In this work, we set forth to evaluate 74 NSP16 attenuation as a platform strategy for live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. Using 75 models that explore heterologous challenge, efficacy in aging, and potential for reversion, we 76 found that the NSP16 mutant alone was not sufficiently attenuated to be used universally.
Previous live-attenuated coronavirus platforms had taken advantage of the need and 86 conservation of NSP14 exonuclease (ExoN) and the coronavirus envelope (E) proteins (16, 21) .
Similar to ExoN, the NSP16 2'O MTase has significant homology across the coronavirus family, 88 more than CoV envelope proteins (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, the critical KDKE enzymatic motif is 89 highly conserved allowing predictable disruption of the 2'O MTase function (22) 
Early host response to SARS-CoV NSP16 mutant equivalent to wild-type infection.
Unlike the ExoN and E protein mutants, dNSP16 coronaviruses demonstrate no significant 101 attenuation in terms of viral replication in vitro except in the context of type I IFN pretreatment 102 (19) . Similarly, in vivo characterizations found no deficit in viral replication at early times (days 1 103 and 2), but a marked attenuation at late times post infection (19, 20) . These results suggest that 104 the early portions of dNSP16 infection are equivalent to wild-type virus infection. To further 105 explore this question, we utilized a systems biology approach to compare wild-type and dNSP16 106 mutant in 20-week old C57BL/6 mice. In this model, mice infected with the mouse-adapted mutant has no discernable attenuation at days 1 or 2 (Fig. 1C) ; however, at day 4, a 100-fold 111 reduction in replication is observed in the lungs of dNSP16 infected mice that corresponds with 112 the kinetics of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Importantly, the global host 113 expression response models the same trend. PCA plots of total RNA expression finds that wild-114 type and mutant virus profiles cluster together at days 1 and 2 ( Fig. 1D) dNSP16, monitored for 28 days, and subsequently challenged with the chimeric strain following vaccination (Fig. 2D) . Together, the data indicate that a live-attenuated NSP16 137 vaccine has sufficient capacity to protect from heterologous CoV challenge in young mice.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/309591 doi: bioRxiv preprint with the absence of detectable viral replication at both days 2 and 4 ( Fig. 4I) . Together, the 163 results indicate that while the dNSP16 mutant harbors some risk of pathogenicity at high doses, 164 it can also provide aged mice with robust protection from lethal challenge.
NSP16 mutant reverts in immune-compromised model.
Despite some important caveats, the dNSP16 mutant has demonstrated efficacy as a vaccine 167 following both, heterologous challenge and in aged models of SARS-CoV disease. However, 168 reversion and adaptation of a live attenuated strain represents a significant concern for its use in 
Viability of a multiple mechanism, live-attenuated vaccine.
With concerns for reversion and potential virulence, a live-attenuated vaccine platform targeting 187 only NSP16 activity should be limited to only dire circumstances.

Importantly, sera from dNSP16/ExoN vaccinated mice was capable of 215 neutralizing both WT SARS-CoV as well as chimeric spike virus (Fig. 6H) . While not equivalent 216 to neutralization induced by the dNSP16 mutant (Fig. 2) , the results indicate that the double 217 mutant vaccine provided robust protection from both homologous and heterologous challenge. 
Having addressed both heterologous challenge and efficacy in aged models, we next examined 235 the dNSP16/ExoN mutation for reversion potential. Similar to the original dNSP16 mutant, 236 dNSP16/ExoN showed no significant disease in RAG -/mice during acute infection. After 30 237 days, mice were euthanized, lung tissue harvested, homogenized, clarified, and used to infect 238 10-week old BALB/c mice.

Examination of input viral titer revealed 241 the absence of detectable virus in all five RAG -/mice infected with the dNSP16/ExoN mutant 242 (Fig. 7H) . The results indicate that following in vivo replication for 30 days, the dNSP16/ExoN 243 mutant failed to revert to a virulent form. In addition, the results suggest that the double mutant 244 could be cleared in immune compromised mice without the need for traditional adaptive 245 immunity. Together, the data argue that the dNSP16/ExoN mutant is unlikely to revert even in The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
