24 The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a 25 chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani 26 reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite 27 also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we 28 compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. 29 donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective 30 changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions 31 by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while 32 inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel 33 quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was 34 activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by 35 polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic 36 in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) 37 and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR 38 inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting 39 corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-β decreased in presence of the 40 eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite 41 modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. 42 donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under 43 mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR-and eIF4A-44 sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. 45 donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 4 48 Author Summary 49 Fine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses 50 to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the 51 protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell 52 functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-53 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression 54 programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding 55 mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. 56 Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins 57 share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and 58 microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts 59 that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the 60 activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A 61 activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the 62 opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene 63 expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be 64 targeted for therapeutic intervention. : bioRxiv preprint 5 65 66 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne infection caused by protozoan parasites of the 67 Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) complex. VL is endemic in more than 60 countries and is 68 frequently lethal if untreated (1). The lack of efficient vaccines and the failure to control 69 emerging parasite resistance reflect the urgent need to design safe and efficient therapeutics 70 targeting host-encoded factors (2). In mammalian hosts, Leishmania promastigotes preferentially 71 colonize macrophages, where they transform into replicative amastigotes that proliferate within 72 modified phagolysosomes (1). To establish a successful infection, the parasite dampens 73 antimicrobial responses, alters vesicle trafficking, and subverts immunomodulatory functions 74 and metabolic processes of the host cell (3). 75 76 At the molecular level, L. donovani modulates the activity of multiple host cell signaling 77 pathways and transcription factors (3). Consistently, profiling of mRNA levels in L. donovani-78 infected macrophages revealed vast perturbation in host gene expression programs associated 79 with parasite persistence (4-8). The pioneering data supporting widespread changes in host cell 80 mRNA levels following L. donovani infection were obtained in bone marrow-derived 81 macrophages (BMDMs) using cDNA-microarrays (4). This study showed that L. donovani 82 axenic amastigotes downregulate expression of genes involved in apoptosis and NF-κB signaling 83 while stimulating those encoding monocyte chemoattractants. Subsequently, DNA-microarray 84 based studies of human and mouse monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L. donovani 85 promastigotes identified increased levels of transcripts related to cell migration and repression of 86 genes encoding MHC class II molecules (5, 6). More recently, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of 87 mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with L. donovani showed a strong suppression of genes . CC-BY 4.0
9 142 changes in protein levels imposed by altered transcription or mRNA stability (24). Interestingly, 143 a large subset of transcripts whose abundance changed upon infection with L. donovani 144 amastigotes or promastigotes was buffered at the level of translation (21% out of 1,051 and 29% 145 out of 1,604 mRNAs, respectively) (Fig 1D and S1 Table) . In contrast, only a small number of 146 transcripts (71 mRNAs) whose levels differed between L. donovani promastigote-and 147 amastigote-infected BMDMs (S1B-C Figs) were translationally buffered. These data indicate (Fig 2A and S2 Table) . Enriched categories, among 157 proteins encoded by translationally activated transcripts in BMDMs infected by either parasite 158 life stage, included chromatin remodeling, regulation of mRNA metabolism (i.e. splicing, export 159 from the nucleus, stability and translation), regulation of type I IFN production and protein 160 deubiquitination (Fig 2A, 228 Translation of eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs is activated upon L. donovani infection 229 As mentioned above, the RNA helicase eIF4A facilitates translation of transcripts harboring long 230 and highly structured 5' UTR sequences. Some such encoded proteins are involved in tumor 231 immune evasion (36) and progression of viral (37) and protozoan parasitic infections (12), 232 suggesting that eIF4A-dependent translation may contribute to herein observed changes in 233 translational efficiencies (Fig 1) .

Consistent with eIF4B-235 dependent modulation of eIF4A activity, levels of phosphorylated and total eIF4B protein were 236 increased in BMDMs infected with L. donovani amastigotes or promastigotes (Fig 5A) . To test 237 whether this may contribute to selective regulation of mRNA translation following parasite 238 infection, we assessed translational efficiencies of a compilation of previously described eIF4A-239 sensitive transcripts (36, 38-40). Indeed, following infection independently of parasite stage, the 240 translational efficiencies of such mRNAs were elevated as compared to background transcripts 241 (p <0.001) (Fig 5B) . From a total of 1198 previously described eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs, 149 242 were translationally activated whereas 80 were translationally suppressed upon infection with 243 promastigotes or amastigotes of L. donovani (S3B Table) . The presence of a 5' UTR G-244 quadruplex-forming guanine quartet (CGG) 4 motif is an indirect approach to assess whether 245 transcripts are expected to be more dependent of eIF4A for their translation (41). Indeed, 246 analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME) revealed a significant enrichment of the (CGG) 4 motif in 5' 247 UTRs of transcripts with highly activated translation (≥4-fold increase in translational efficiency 248 upon infection) as compared to 5' UTRs from transcripts with unaltered translational efficiency 249 (p = 0.0036) (Fig 5C) . TGF-β is a key cytokine implicated in the distinctive immune suppression 250 that follows L. donovani infection in vivo (42, 43) . Upon infection with L. donovani amastigotes 251 or promastigotes, anota2seq analysis identified augmented translational efficiency of the tumor 252 growth factor-β 1 (Tgfb1) mRNA (Fig. 2B , top-right panel and S1 Table) , which is highly 253 dependent of eIF4A for its translation (39). Accordingly, production of TGF-β increased in 254 BMDMs upon infection (Fig 5D) without changes in Tgfb1 mRNA abundance (Fig 5E) .

These data 276 indicate that mTOR limits L. donovani persistence within the host cell while eIF4A promotes it.
