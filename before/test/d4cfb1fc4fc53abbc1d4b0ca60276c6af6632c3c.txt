Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause diseases ranging 8 ≤ 100 on admission.
Excluding one comatose patient without a clear history (classified as severe case), the most 2 3 9
common clinical manifestations at onset of illness include fever (100% of total cases), cough 2 4 0 (70% of severe cases, 90% of moderate cases), fatigue (100% of severe cases, 70% of 2 4 1 moderate cases) and myalgia (50% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases). Less common 2 4 2 symptoms include sputum production (20% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases), diarrhea 2 4 3 (10% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases), headache (10% of severe cases, 10% of 2 4 4 moderate cases) and hemoptysis (10% of severe cases).

The mean duration from illness onset to 2 4 7 dyspnea was 8.6 days. Arterial blood gas (ABG) test was performed in 10 patients on 2 4 8 admission (six severe and four moderate cases). Of them, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly 2 4 9 lower in severe cases (122.9 mmHg) than moderate cases (366.2 mmHg). Three severe cases The routine blood tests on admission of three (30%) moderate cases showed mild leucopenia 2 5 4
(white blood cell count (WBC) < 4 × 10 /L). WBC counts were normal or slightly increased 2 5 5 in all the severe cases. Both WBC and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in severe 2 5 6 cases (9.2 × 10 /L and 8.0 × 10 /L) than moderate cases (4.7 × 10 /L and 3.1 × 10 /L).
Whereas lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (0.7 × 10 /L) than 2 5 8 moderate cases (1.1 × 10 /L). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <0.8 × 10 /L) was found in 2 5 9 8 (72.7%) severe cases and only 1 (10.0%) moderate cases (table 2) .
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were higher in severe cases (567.2 U/L) than moderate cases (234.4 U/L).
Concentrations of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and ferritin on tended to be higher in severe cases (0.5 ng/mL) than moderate cases (0.1 ng/mL). Activated 2 6 9 partial thromboplastin time (APTT) on admission was significantly shorter in severe cases 2 7 0 (36.2s) than moderate cases (44.6s). D-dimer levels on admission were markedly greater in 2 7 1 severe cases (8.2 ug/mL) than moderate cases (0.4 ug/mL).

Preliminary analysis of circulating immune cells subsets showed that absolute number of total 2 9 3
T lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells decreased in the majority of patients with either 2 9 4 severe (100%, 100% and 87.5%) or moderate COVID-19 (83.3%, 100% and 83.3%), and 2 9 5 total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells counts were reduced more profoundly in author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This is the first preliminary study evaluating descriptively the immunologic characteristics of including hsCRP and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases than moderate cases.
Plasma concentrations of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
including IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 increased in the majority of severe cases and was 3 5 2 significantly higher than did those in moderate cases, suggesting cytokine storms might be 3 5 3 associated with disease severity.

These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes,
particularly CD4 + T cells, resulting in diminished number as well as their IFN-γ production,
which might be correlated with disease severity of COVID-19.
CD4 + T cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, orchestrating the deletion 3 7 7
and amplification of immune cells, especially CD8 + T cells. CD4 + T cells facilitate 3 7 8
virus-specific antibody production via the T-dependent activation of B cells 11 . However, CD8 + 3 7 9
T cells exert their effects mainly through two mechanisms, cytolytic activities against target 3 8 0 cells or cytokines secretion, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 as well as many chemokines 12 .
The production of IFN-γ is essential for the resistance against infection of various pathogens 3 8 2 such as virus, bacteria, and parasite 13 .

Our study has some limitations. First of all, we mainly evaluated the number of T cell subsets 4 2 6
